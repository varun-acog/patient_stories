    "transcript": "The tissues of our bodies are made up of trillions of cells each with their own structure and function And if you take a closer look you&amp;#39;ll see \nthat some cells are happier and more energetic than others. Why?  Because these energetic cells have \nactive mitochondria that produce enough energy   or ATP needed to keep the cell functioning \nnormally.  Think of this as the fuel needed to  power the engine that drives the cell.  There are times though when genetic mutations prevent the mitochondria from producing enough ATP to keep the \ncell functioning.  Over time this ATP deficiency can lead to the onset of symptoms like those seen \nin Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia.  In healthy mitochondria   a protein called frataxin plays an essential role in producing ATP and maintaining iron homeostasis. For patients with Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia the \namount of frataxin protein is too low. Frataxin deficiency not only lowers the amount of ATP produced but it can also cause a buildup of excess iron in the cell.   Too much iron can trigger reactive oxygen species also known as ROS that eventually cause oxidative \nstress resulting in damage to DNA  and essential proteins which can ultimately \ncause cells to stop functioning altogether. Because Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is a multi-system \ndisease many tissue types can be affected, for example frataxin deficiency in cardiac \nand nervous tissue can cause symptoms of   cardiomyopathy and loss of muscle coordination.  But there is hope in gene therapy.  Gene therapy  is the process of adding genetic material directly \ninto cells through a non-infectious viral vector   to compensate for genes that are not working. For \nFriedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia patients gene therapy may be   used to deliver a functioning frataxin gene \ninto the nucleus of the target cells.  The new  frataxin gene without the mutation will generate frataxin protein for the mitochondria.  Gene therapy for Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia will likely not be a cure but rather a part of a patient&amp;#39;s treatment plan. Several gene therapy approaches may be needed to target the different affected cell types. And the degree of therapeutic impact will \npresumably depend on the stage of disease when gene therapy is administered. It is also important to note that there are outcome uncertainties with gene therapies, so clinical trials are needed \nto understand variability in treatment effects. Many researchers are actively working to \ndevelop gene therapy for Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia   they are collaborating with a larger community of other rare disease scientists, regulatory agencies   like the FDA, industry partners, patients, \nand the Friedrichs Ataxia Research Alliance   to share information and optimize gene therapy  approaches for Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia.  Please continue your education on gene therapy by viewing other modules in this series on the FARA website.",

    "transcript": "hello sir good morning my name is dr saw one of the pieces candidate here today i&amp;#39;ve been asked to examine your legs is it all right yes sir so what i&amp;#39;m going to do i&amp;#39;ll have a very good look and then assess your muscle strength and also some of the reflexes in your legs so during this procedure if you have any of the pain and discomfort just let me i&amp;#39;ll stop at that moment here&amp;#39;s my doctor immediately after i enter into the room the five important steps that you need to do i always speak on that you&amp;#39;re always having a good smile with the good greetings my idea so here&amp;#39;s the greetings should be fast but here&amp;#39;s my idea listen very carefully you enter into the room with the good smile the good greetings mean the greetings and in the meantime you have to wash your hands and handshake with your passions and this is the greetings will be the completed if you do the good smiling with the washing hands and handshake with your passion these three important components that you need to do so yes my dear doctor so good greetings immediately after that introductions my dad the next second important point the introduction introduce yourself my name is dr saha one of the pieces candidate here today and third is the instructions here&amp;#39;s my idea you need to do the instructions instructions means that what you&amp;#39;re going to do what is written and what is instructed to do for this case my dear so you need to see here what is written here the station three neurology this young boy is a toxic examine the lower labs so yes find a doctor you enter into the room you have to see what is written what is what is uh instructed to do so yes you need to do the exam in the lower leg so instructions is important so you need to still to your patients that that&amp;#39;s uh i have been asked to examine your legs so this is very important and a bit a brief description that you need to do that what you&amp;#39;re going to do i have a very good look and maybe assist with muscle strength or maybe the knobs of your lower limbs you can say in that way yes during this procedure if you feel any kind of pain and discomfort just let me know is i call it the pain management idea so i call it the pain position and poser this three important component father that you need to do so here&amp;#39;s the total six complete packages that you need to do starting with the greetings introduction instruction then pain position and poser pain yes as i said daily discomfort and pain management that you need to tell and each and every station like the station three that the neurology that you need to tell for each and every case&amp;#39;s mind at the same same same steps that you need to follow and next is the position minder for the lower limit examination that you need to make the bastion lying flat in bed and last is a poser mighty the exposure you need to expose the lower limbs like the way the limbs is the lower limbs and legs are exposed to the mid time up to the lower leg and that should be fully exposed so you need to do that i need to tell that would you mind just put of your gown and put your mind up for me that i need to examine you so these are the ways that you need to examine and before handling your passions these are the important six important steps that you need to know my idea so once again that i&amp;#39;m re recapping once again what is that starting with the introduction instructions so yes my dear you need to do the six important steps starting from the greetings introduction instructions and next is the pain position and poser that exposure that you need to do so once again my deal listen very carefully the important tips and tricks you can turn in the room and you need to see the instructions as i said earlier and other other important tips and tricks and these important tips and tricks in neurology especially the instructions is sometimes giving a good diagnosis if you&amp;#39;re lucky enough to you&amp;#39;ll get a certain instructions like the young boy is a toxic so examine the lower lamps so i did listen very carefully you already know what does this ataxia really means i said the a4 absent in takshia means the balance idea so the absent balance so now you need to know the balance is maintained by the three important components in our body the first one is the cerebellum second is the vestibular and third one is the peripheral nerves that comes from the dorsal column means i call it the dorsal column sign peripheral nubs that are responsible for the joint position census maida so the three important components is the cerebellum vascular and the peripheral naps the sensory knobs so now if you say the ataxia means the absent balances so definitely the cerebellar lesion and definitely the second one is a vegetable relation and third one is a peripheral neuropathy the sensory in your body we call it the cerebellar toxic and then the vestibular ataxia and thyroid sensory ataxia so these are the three categories of the ataxias so now let me start once again you have seen these boys antarctic so you can make your diagnosis it can be cellular toxic it can be vestibular toxic it can be sensible ataxia but my delete isn&amp;#39;t very careful in your exams so vestibular toxic usually not come to our cases yes it goes to the ent department so you you don&amp;#39;t need to worry about yes and also not a very frequent cases that you need to think about it so you can think about maybe the cerebral adaptation and the sensory taxia or maybe combination of these both together so yes my dear doc listen very carefully i&amp;#39;m giving important tips and tricks if the young boy with the ataxia yes you should think about the single diagnosis who has the frantic set action what i say once again young boy ataxia the diagnosis trajectory so yes once again the frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia involving both the cerebellum and the pre-filled naps and the sensory one means the sensor reaction means that fragix and axia involving the both cerebellum as well as the peripheral nerves the sensory knobs involving and responsible for the dorsal column sign so yes you see that you enter into the room and you have seen a young boy lying flat on the bed and also you have seen the instructions he&amp;#39;s written that the young boys the toxic diagnosis has done the fair destruction now we have to demonstrate the important features of the fragix ataxia to the examiners all them together so that you can say yes the fedex attacks so yes you think about the frederick seduction now you know about the frederick structure what does it really mean you need to have some of the important components before handling the patient&amp;#39;s mind yeah you need to show demonstrate the important science of prediction consistent your diagnosis put it there before going to the frederick structure fedex is is an important component of the heritage ataxias so hadidity ataxias the first one is the predict selection and second one is the etachic telendic nature i used to call the fa at means the fact my idea so once again fedex ataxia and arctic telegectasia as i said the young boy yes of course with the attractions think about the diagnosis right they said actually so frederic setaxia under the heading sometimes we we we give a good big headings like the spino cerebellar cerebulator yes under the headings of the spinal cell attractor there are long list of attaches with one of the heavy deteriorations that you need to know that is the traditional action so now i can say the phrygic structure is nothing but spinal it does mean the spinal cord and the cerebellum both will be involved in this disease my dear so you need to demonstrate the cerebellar science and the spinal cord damage that leads to the peripheries and also as i said the peripheral nups is the dorsal column so the dosage signs that are involved as [Music] [Applause] [Music] the best and the best and the best course event you will experience in your whole life [Music] along with that is because the peripheral knobs are also involved so that we will get some of the lower neuron type of the weakness as well so as i say the spinal cord is involved so the upper motor neurone type of the weakness with the upper motor neuron type of the lesions as i said the peripheral nubs as well so the yes the lower amount of neuron type of the weakness of the mixed pictures as well and as well as the years once again the dorsal column signs the sensory toxins will be there i mean the sensory knobs should be also affected so the both lower sensory and motor knobs will be affected but along with the upper motor neural type of the weakness yes my dear let&amp;#39;s start and think about it yes we have to demonstrate this man and this young boy having some of the upper motor neutron type of the lesions and also the law motivation type of deletions as well as the doctor there&amp;#39;s a dorsal column is affected so now the upper motor neutralization as i said the bundle packs that hsce means the hypotonia hyper reflection cloners and extensor banter so yes my guy among them i said it the extensive planter is the pathognomic features to diagnose the upper water neutron type of the lesions and next to the long-term neutron type of the lesions yes you&amp;#39;ll get the all the features with the weakness wasting and fasciculation i used to say the wwf so we need to see the yes the wasting is one of the important features that will give an idea here&amp;#39;s a lot of new relations and also you can get the hypotonia and then you can get some of the hypo reflection as well but here&amp;#39;s the most important features the wasting yes the next one is the peripheral naps that is the sensor means the dorsal column is affected so the dorsal column if it is affected then you&amp;#39;ll get the joint position sensors and the vibration sensors are lost so yes mighty doctor you need to show at least these features because these features will have the long list of differential diagnosis altogether we&amp;#39;ll discuss later on but let&amp;#39;s start how to do examine and how to think and how to reach towards your diagnosis my idea in a case of young boy antarctic yes my dear doctor immediately after entering the room yes as i said that you need to examine the boy and definitely the lower limbs that has to be exposed and you need to start your examination the inspection and the inspection starts from the food in bed so that you can see once again inspection we are looking for wasting my dear as well as the fasciculation and maximum the scar marks so we need to see what the findings in his case so let&amp;#39;s see how to do that you need to come come up here from the foot in bed and you see that i have a very good look and just look onto the distal part of the legs and also the digital part here and there and also the proximal part of the muscles that we are looking for wasting so we have seen a significant investing in the digital part he has and having some of the proximal part also some of the voicing so we can say some of the generalized bursting but having some of the distal part is more predominant so digital part wasting definitely the nav disease no doubt about it now you can see some of the fasciculations that you are expecting so there is no fasciculation so only the wasting that we found the distal predominant then there are the proximal part and there is no obvious scar marks as well so only an inspection that you yes young boy toxic and once again you inspect this young boy but once again my dear lord lim&amp;#39;s examination should be started the gate examinations so yes immediately after the six important steps that you come up here and you need to tell this young boy because this lord lives examination should be started with the gate my dear so the gate examination that you need to tell to your patients that sir will he be able to work for me so this is very much important because the passion cannot work so how can you start the work so you need to tell and ask his permission whether he can able to work for me and once again if the any of the bedside maybe the wheelchair will be there so you can understand the patient is really unable to work so yes you can ask him will he be able to work for me so that you can just stand up and make some of the walking and see the gate so this boy is really unable to work because of the ataxia the balance problem both sided but we are demonstrating here how this young boy having such a both sided taxia but you shouldn&amp;#39;t do in the real exams because he&amp;#39;s really attacked he&amp;#39;s very difficult as single man supporting him and doing an attack and and showing the gate examinations all right let&amp;#39;s start yes try to work for me sir yes so you can see he has the difficulty of walking and really difficult so uh in the real exams you don&amp;#39;t need to examine that gate in his case but we are just showing him how the difficulty is going on so the two doctors has to take the good supports to walking and he needs the walking aids to work so now turn round stand down so yes yes so really difficult for him to walk you see the legs really walking difficulty but see the gate here it&amp;#39;s a bit of gate that we can observe yes now turn around turn down yes tanja yes once again you see a bit of and the most important the toxic gate yes the itachi he&amp;#39;s a toxic so yes now time around once again yes yes yes see so he&amp;#39;s really attack check so you have to give the two both sides support on the both sides no just stand now turn down turn down once again turn down turn round yes yes so can you close your feet together yes now see it&amp;#39;s really difficult to stand for him to look forward look forward right so now see how he&amp;#39;s a toxic really ready one two three so you see that he&amp;#39;s a toxic so he&amp;#39;s really a tactic so that yes it&amp;#39;s very difficult to do the test in real exams so you shouldn&amp;#39;t do that so now get back and once again now close your eyes close your eyes so once again it&amp;#39;s more toxic also you see so yes with the open dyes the toxic is the cerebellar syndrome and with the closed eyes more toxic yes so this is also the rhombus test is positive so yes he has got the cerebellus syndrome as well as the dorsal gallant is also affected yes nobody arise now now yes get the seed back sir yes why the doctor as you have seen the great examinations and he has a typical etakshi gate might here and along with the torture that we have seen he has a little bit high step that we can see and observed and really a difficulty in walking all together so yes immediately after the gate examination that you have seen that he has the test that he have done the toxic test there is a cerebellar science with open eyes he has the problem and also with the closed eyes with the more antarctic so he can understand he has a toxic gait as well as he has the rhombus stays also positive so cerebral antarctic once again along with the sensory structure all together the diagonal of the single diagnostic that predicts the dark yeah assuming that that you made your diagnostic threat destruction then you just bring your passions back onto the couch and then start exhalation of the lower limbs then inspect the lower limb start all right you see the side view here has got a piss clevers so this is another side view on the left hand side so this is also the pest curve as you see so you see the pescelas so is a cavity miter you see the cavity so these are pest covers the typical pest covers so typical pesky was me is the long-standing peripheral neuropathy the long-standing peripheral neuropathy and the joint position sense because you want to cuff and cuffed onto the floor so that&amp;#39;s why this pesky bus the long-standing feature is a long-standing particular neurobite so you see here you see on the left-hand side also you see the pest cover so this is the cavity you see a big cavity is here so this is also a peskeville soap these pest covers are bilaterally pascallus young boy once again the feature of the long-standing peripheral neuropathy so now you have to start immediately after the inspect that you found that does some of the wasting more in the disk style without fasciculations and without any scars yes by the doctor then you need to do the motor examination as i said the modern examination starts from tpr pr cesium idea so the tone power reflexes and the plantar response and the c for chlorides and c for coordination these are the tests that you need to do and demonstrate the examiners that you are expecting the findings to show to make your diagnosis that you already diagnosed within your mind that runs in your mind by the diagnostophytic structure so yes let&amp;#39;s start with the tone examination and tone exhibition starts with the patients and saying that sir will just keep your legs floppy and relax as much as you can i&amp;#39;d like to test the total few legs or muscles of your legs idea so what you need to do yes the floppy and you see the tone you see the tone so actually we are looking for as i said we are looking for hypertonia rather than hypotonia so the findings a bit of hypotonia is there but once again you don&amp;#39;t need to take it as a hypotonia because as i said earlier that you need to take the hypertonia the findings for the upper motor neuron type of the weakness that you&amp;#39;re expecting but yeah you see this movement yes you can say hypo or maybe the normal tone is very difficult to interpret and once again the sudden movements you see so this is also not at least the hypertonia it may be hypo or maybe normal tones so this is examination [Music] [Applause] [Music] the best and the best and the best course anywhere you will experience in your whole life yes so immediately after that you found that the tones are not increased at least not increased that you&amp;#39;re expecting so you shouldn&amp;#39;t do the clueless test idea because the hypertunia if you found that you should do that close otherwise you shouldn&amp;#39;t do that so you found the tone is reduced or maybe the normal and immediately after the tone that the power test that should be done and you need to tell to your passions so i&amp;#39;d like to assess the strength of your muscles so what do you need to do just tell him just raise the right leg of the bed for me without bending your right knee yes so we need to tell him so you see he&amp;#39;s really difficult to hold it hold the hold the right leg yes razor he is raising is very difficult but he he can at least at this point on now on the left left side he can but he&amp;#39;s unable to hold it yes so he can understand yes his legs are really weak and the muscle strength is reduced and you need to tell him yes now push onto my hands into the bed so yes very difficult you see i can i can hold it up now bend your knees pull towards you so yes pull towards you don&amp;#39;t let me straighten it so he cannot so you see once again once again so yes now push onto my hands push so yes this is also way push onto my hands push push push so this is also weight now up your ankles back for me back back back back yes don let me push them down now push onto my hands push push push yes now keep the grip towards the ceiling towards the ceiling towards the ceiling don&amp;#39;t let me push it down don&amp;#39;t let me push it down don&amp;#39;t let me push it down now push push push push push now push yes so what we have found right he found that he has the muscle strength is reduced both proximal and distal symmetrically so immediately after the tone that you have done the power the muscle strength and now the tpr the are for reflexes idea so you need to take the hammer and do the test for the reflexes so yes you need to tell him i&amp;#39;d like to see the reflexes of the legs so you see the no contraction here so the reflexes are reduced now if you found the reflexes you are not getting that so you need to do the reinforcement test idea so you need to tell him can you clinch your teeth plenty yes and now cleanse and see the reflexes are not there only just a vibration is there but no reflexes no muscle contractions so definitely the knee reflexes are absent bilaterally now then kill jacks once again so this is also absent now cleans your teeth prints are cleansed yes this is also absent once again cleanse your teeth so only a vibration is there so we found that both the knee reflexes and the ankle reflexes are absent bilaterally immediately after that the tone power reflexes that you have saw you have you have examined so you need to do the plantar response is a tpr pr for the plantar responses so let&amp;#39;s see how the plantar response is so you need to take it this stick my i need to tell him i need to scratch on the sole of your feet it might be a discomfort a little bit but you need to do that so you need to scratch it you see immediately after that you you&amp;#39;re looking for you see the toes are extended so this is the extensor plantar yes typically extensor plantar so once again here is also extensive plunder so yes the quantum responses are bilaterally accidental plantar so what we found we found the knee and ankle reflexes are absent by the accents of plantar so once again you can think about yes epson exacts and excessive plantar is another important syndrome so they can think about yes the fragile bacteria is among them that can produce yes my dear so immediately after the test that you found the tone normal or radiused power is radius made the strength muscle weakness is there both the proximal and dista and the reflexes means the knee and ankle reflexes are absent but bilaterally access of manta immediately after that you need to do the c for coordination testimony that means the heels in test that you need to do so now see now how the heel chain test you can do it because the patient can raise the legs of the bed by himself so you can do this test and this test is appropriate if it would be something like the patient unable to raise the leg over the bed so in that case you shouldn&amp;#39;t do the coordination test idea that will be inappropriate in that case but in his case you should and you must do the coordination test as because you already learned from the gate the diagnosis the ataxia and you found that the cellular toxins are also there so you need this hinge in test is really in your hands getting the findings altogether so you need to tell him sir can you just put your legs hair down to the knee and go through the shin and do it as quickly as you can try and try for it try for it so it&amp;#39;s very difficult for him really you see once again it&amp;#39;s really difficult he&amp;#39;s unable to do so so impaired heal sin test on the right side now on the left side so it&amp;#39;s really difficult for him you see difficult really difficult okay thank you thank you very much so you found the hills in tests are also impaired but sometimes the houston test because of the weakness to that accent the patient is really unable to do so so a bit of confusions are there but keeping your mind is because you already have seen the takshya as a gate ataxia and also you have found the cerebral toxic as well as the sensory toxic altogether so we need to just now the sensory test to diagnose the sensory ataxia and also you have to think about in your mind that at the end that you can see and you can tell to your examiner that i need to see the full circular examinations so that you can get the diagnosis in your hands so yes my doctor the heel shin test is really important in this case especially immediately after that the motor examination the tpr prcc that you already have done the sensory test that you need to do you already forecast in your mind that do some color is affected in his case that&amp;#39;s a young boy so you started the dorsal column test and those circles signs involve the joint position sense and the vibration sensors so let me start by the joint position sense and vibration sensors immediately after that yes once again the dorsal column side and the spinothermic tract signs altogether sometimes can be also involved in his case so you need to do the test for the due circle of science with joint positions and vibrational senses and spinal cord retract sign for the cotton rule and the pinpoint test so let me start showing that the joint position says so now look at look at the leg you can you can raise the leg to show him this is up this is down okay now close your eyes now tell me whether this is up or down this is so he cannot say now this is up or down so he&amp;#39;s unable to do so the joint position says is impact now here so he&amp;#39;s saying down but this is up so here once again now seeing his up he&amp;#39;s confusing the joint position says very typical for the joint position sense is really impaired in this case so yes the dorsal column is affected as we already have seen the rhombus test is positive significantly positive so definitely the joint position sense and the door circle is affected now the vibration sensor that you need to test you need to take this tuning fork and the vibrator and just tell him are you feeling the vibration not the cold i need to say this is the vibration test now close your eyes are you feeling the vibration yes or no yes all right he&amp;#39;s saying the yes now tell me honey stop yes are you feeling the vibration now tell me when it&amp;#39;s tough now tell me are you feeling now tell me honey stop all right excellent so this is very evident and very very obvious that his vibration sense is intact but the joint position sense is absolutely lost immediately after that that the dcs that you have done the joint position sense and the vibration census then the test that we need to do that the spinothalamic tract science the stsm idea and stage includes the cotton loop and the pin break and continual test starts with this one and needs to tell him are you feeling this is soft now close your eyes and put in different places of relax if you found then you say yes if you don&amp;#39;t say no okay excellent so once again the domito is really helpful as i said earlier my dad can you just remember earlier what you have done you have done this is you need to remember this is l1 this is l2 and this is l3 knee so we need to remember as i said the l1 l2 l3 the knee and l4 is total medially down to the floor and this is the torso with the l5 and the lateral border is an s1 so once again l two l three the knee l t e and l four immediately down to the floor l four the down to the floor and dosa is l5 and s1 is a letter border so you need to focus on to the dharma tom [Music] so are you feeling no this is this is this one so i need to just tell him whether he is spilling or not so this is l2 this is l2 l3 l3 l4 down to the floor this is also l4 and the door sum is an l5 an l5 and this is the lateral border is an s1 and this is an s1 so this boy is saying that he is not getting the yes the soft coronal test is really absent in all the uh lower parts of both legs so you need to just coming up from down to up so you need to tell that are you feeling so if you feel if you feel then let me know he is saying that he is not feeling now feeling all right he&amp;#39;s saying that this is areas he can feel so now now [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] the best and the best and the best course event you will experience in your whole life [Music] now filling so this is the area so yes he has some of the lost of course sensation means the sensory means the spinal cord track sign is also lost in the body names bilaterally a bit asymmetry but yes you can say somewhat symmetrical loss of spinal atomic tract signs altogether a cotton wool test immediately after the cotton test that you need to the pinprick test idea how to do that just tell him are you feeling now this is sharp now close your eyes now put in the same places so if you feel then let me know yes if you don&amp;#39;t say no even if you feel any of the differences just let me know okay so once again this is so he is filling so this is l2 this is l3 knee this is l4 down to the floor this is also l4 and this is the door sum l5 and this s1 is l5 and the s1 and he is saying that he is getting the all the sensation or the pinpic test and somewhat to some extent the kernel are absent in the both long lines but the here&amp;#39;s a pinpic test is really present so yes immediately after that that you finish the sensory testimony yeah you formulate your diagnosis and in the meantime that you need to do just give the clothes back and give a good smile and give a good thanks and say thank you sir thank you very much thank you and you have done excellent for me your super some of the sentences is really helpful to make the environment is really super or whatever fantastic you can say my idea and immediately after that give the clothes back all together and yes cover up of the both legs and then wash your hands and turn around to examine us and say them your completeness of your examinations and you need to tell the examiner sir i would like to complete my neurological examinations of this young boy to do the upper limbs examination cranial nerves higher psychic functions and the cerebellus syndrome all together and i&amp;#39;d like to finish my examinations at the bedside to see the observation chart that includes that the pulse temperature respiratory blood pressure and oxygen saturation and once again i&amp;#39;d like to see that urine dipstick to see the sugar protein rbc nitrites and yes by the doctor you need to tell all them together to finish the examination part that you have done adequately properly and effectively completeness of your examination part so that you can get the satisfactory marks all together yes why the examination starts with the inspection that you have done the motor examination that the ttr prcc and the sensory examination the dcs and sts and immediately after that you done all the steps before and after and you finished it and wash your hands then come forward and saying these three important components means the neurological examinations and then examination to see the observation chart and once again to do the urine dipstick that you finished your examinations effectively and completely my dear so immediately after that you finished your examination saying them all them together you need to present your case my idea and presentation is one of the most important integral part to satisfy the examiner and to imprison to get the satisfactory marks all together so i do listen very carefully with the important tips and tricks if you&amp;#39;re really confident as i said the instructions give the diagnosis of the frantic structure so you can start the examinations and you can start the presentations with the main diagnosis or you should think about the three important components that i already said in other instructions videos that you have already said and you already learned them all then together the three important questions and answers that you need to make out in the presentation scales and in presentation then you need to start with the what type of deletion mind is the first and second one is the higher resolution and third is the why isolation so this is the best way actually to present your case or you can start your first diagnosis and then you can give all the evidences all together but this is very high likely to get the impressions the satisfactory marks all together from the examiners to say that three important questions and answers all together so how to do that let&amp;#39;s start with the first question and answer another important always always i always say that the important tips and tricks always look at the both both of the examiners both of the eyes of the both examiners altogether and good smile and present your case with it confidently so my critical diagnosis of this young boy the type of the weakness that i found there is a lower motor neutron type of the weakness yes evidence by there isn&amp;#39;t weakness and wasting and also but without any fasciculation but without any scar marks and i found the tone is normal to reduced you can say in that way so sir my clinical diagnosis of this young boy the type of the weakness that i found on examination of the lower lips there is a upper motor neuron type of the lesions as evidenced by the bilaterally extensor plantar and very typical findings of bilateral actions of plantar that i found along with that there is in weakness and there is investing more on the distal than that of the proximal but without any fasciculation and without any scar marks that i found and regarding the tone that i found the normal to reduced but not the hypotonia but not the hyperiflexia and not the clonus is really absent all together but once again the putting all them together what i found that the both the upper motor neutron type of the weakness along with the lower motor neuron type of weakness along with that bilateral peskevas is really important findings so start summarizing that i have found that the both the upper bottom neutral type of deletion evidenced by the bilateral accessory planter along with the law motor neutron type of the weakness that the wasting and weakness both beautifully along the distance then there are the proximal without any fasciculation without any skull marks and along with that bilateral peskevillas and i found the most important findings on the gate was a toxic gate and the instruction is given the young boy is a toxic so he has the upper motor neutral lesions and the lower motor neutral lesions along with the as i found the bilateral pescelas and both the cerebellar taxia as well as the rhombus test is positive means the sensory ataxia and along with that the sensory findings altogether that i found there is the joint position sense is absent but yes vibration sensors is intact but cautionary test to some extent is lost but the pin peak is intact so the summarizing hold them together the lesion and the underlying etiology is the frederick sataxia so in that way you can present or you can start your first presentation also be confident if you are really confident your diagnosis or you can say some of the differential diagnosis in other ways esr so my critical diagnosis of this young boy is a fractix ataxia evidence by this young boy is a touchy according to the history and i found also the gate was a toxic by literally both both sided and including the cerebellar taxi and the sensory target along with that i found it has got both the upper motor neuron type of the weakness and on the lower motor neural type of the weakness along with that bilateral pascals also i have seen that that this boy also has lost the joint position senses and which is one of the important component of the two circular sign so putting all them together this young boy is made the diagnosis in the fabric station i would like to see the more examinations especially the cerebellar syndrome all together and also to see that all the cellular functions are really impaired or not along with that i&amp;#39;d like to know some of the skeletal deformities all together especially the peskevis as as you already have seen and then the sky phosphorius is another important component mainly the scoliosis and also the high or spell it will see in his case whether it is really found or not but in your examination that you need to tell them these are the important skeletal features that you are looking for but along with that would like to see and examine him at the best side whether he has got some of the extra neurological features or not i used to call the external neurological features are dohs that you need to remember the narnix miner the depot diabetes monitors over optica trophy and h for high earth fellate yes my dear and once again h for hokam means the hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and once again the s for sensory neural hearing loss or you can say the s for escavas so these are the important components that you need to look for further so that you can make your extra neurological features and complications are really this boy having a lot so here&amp;#39;s my idea the d for diabetes at the best side you need to see the pin bricks the bed side the hand the middle middle middle finger that the fingertips pin breaks that you&amp;#39;re looking for at the base side and you can say that i need i i like to do the optimus co2 for the to see the retinopathy is the diabetic regulator so at the bedside diagnostic points for the diabetes that you need to look for and export the overall optic atrophy so once again you need the obtainable scope to examine him whether he has got the optic atrophy or not and h for hookah minor the high pass [Music] [Applause] [Music] the best and the best and the best course event you will experience in your whole life [Music] petrovic obstructive cardiomyopathy so we need to tell that i&amp;#39;d like to cardiovascular examinations to look for the double ethical impulse and the heaving effects beat these are the important points at the best side for the hookum and sometimes the patient underwent for the sounds is important yes the icd pacing pacemaker so you can see the pacemaker scar mark and the box all together at the best side make your diagnosis how come and next is the yes as i said the eights were higher spell it so you need to see him highest played this presence or not and once again the kyphos is as for scoliosis and as for sensory neural hearing loss you need to do the releasing of the test to make the diagnostic sensory near sensory neural hearing loss altogether so these are the extra neurological features that you need to tell to the examiners i&amp;#39;d like to do that immediately after that the examiners always ask you the questions for idea these very important questions with the products fedex attaches and hadidity ataxia so hereditary is once again is an hereditary disorders so definitely the genetics is involved so examination asks you what genetics that you know and do you know about about the fredericks and akshaya so you need to tell him the answers in that way so frederic satasia is an autosomal recessive disorder and this is also we call it that the trinuclear repeat expansion disorder i call it the thresh so this is trinity with expansion disorder and he has got the genetic mutation the we call it the toxin gene on chromosome number nine that you need to remember all together so you need to tell yes this fedex reduction is an autism recessive disorder the fetus in gene mutations on chromosome number nine and these are trinomial dry nucleotide repeat expansion disorder and once again the g double a is a tiny nucleated repetitions altogether that made this disease the triangulate expansion disorder but one of the important problems with this fragic seduction is only the exception disorders to the genetic anticipation means it doesn&amp;#39;t follow the genetic anticipations means other trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders follow the genetic anticipations but only these diseases like the fatty sedaxia don&amp;#39;t follow the genetic anticipations so you need to know and next question will be answered what are the trying to repeat expansion disorders i need to say yes we call it the f2ds it&amp;#39;s the never next minute then you need to remember f2 dsp the f2 disease yes f for fedex and action f4 phasel x syndrome and d for once again the dystrophia myotonica and h for hunting does gda so these are the four important disorders that you need to remember the track smile there so these are the important questions are usually asked and sometimes they are asking one of the important questions that the form is frosty one of the important point this form is positive is nothing but the family member sometimes getting some of the single single component the tiny components of the total fedex disease and their complications all together you tell them the surface first is something like that that family members can be suffered from some like the pesky bus and maximum sometimes the deep tender reflexes may be the absent so this is called the form is prostate uh means that the some of the family members will have some of the complications of this physics structure but not that full down disorders all together so these cause the form is positive next question yes the frederick structure is a critical diagnosis the examination will ask you what investigate that you&amp;#39;ll do yes my dear doctor this very much important that what investigations that you need to do to formulate and to make your diagnosis the fatigue sedation as i said the frederic sadaxia is a clinical diagnosis and maximum he can do the genetic test to confirm the diagnosis but the clinical diagnosis is enough to make the fertilizer axia but to exclude the other differential diagnosis of the fertic seduction as because we have found this the component of the syndrome as i said the purposes means the upper motor neuron type of the lesions along with the dorsal column sign a group of disorders can present with these all themes together so you need to know them we call it the c m fast c for cervical malopathy and for multiple sclerosis and fast b is the fa for phytoxidaxia s for sacdb is the subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord or scdc sometimes we call it and last for the t for typographers so yes my dear doctor you need to remember all them to get the cm files because you need to execute critically at the best side also before saying that you diagnose the frederick straxia now let&amp;#39;s talk about the cervical myelopathy cervical myelopathy or myelo radical weight needs the upper limb examination and that needs the important syndromes to be extruded and most of the important points even in the lower lips that asymmetry is the single point that you need to remember means the findings of the lull is if you get some of the asymmetrical findings of the leg weakness at least means the right leg you get the three by five and the left leg you get the one by five so asymmetrical findings is the first diagnostic cervical myophobic so that you can extrude the diagonal cervical myopathy even though you&amp;#39;re examining the lower limbs and for multiple sclerosis as i said the multiple scholars me is the young people in love with the young female or the female passions with this syndrome always think about multiple sclerosis and next to the frantic structure these are the young boys they touching the boys they are touching think about the diagnosis prediction maybe the young girl but yes the boy is more predominant once again the next important point the young boy is really important my dear the young boy used to say there is a less than 20 years with a teen group of peoples are usually affected this boy suffered from for the last six years and he started to notice himself that he has some of the difficulty in balance since he was aged like the 13 years and he&amp;#39;s a 19 years old boy the six years back he noticed first that yes he has some of the progressive some problem with the uh balance and the difficulty in walking so yes these are the important point the young by means the less than 20 years with the teenage boys presented with the toxic the first diagnosis frederickson actually and this fedex action not only the attacks she has single component the both component all together with the cerebellum and the peripheral naps a sensory component all together make him to beta check and savvy could combine the generation of spinal cord with the sacd once again this can also produce this category of the syndrome but once again it has the other important features because the b12 might listen very carefully the vitamin b12 deficiency is the most important cause that you need to know the punisher&amp;#39;s anemia and the punitious enemy also has got some of the other autoimmune associations we&amp;#39;ll discuss in another lectures right here and next the t4 table paris is really important that you need to remember what is this there is a tempo parasite this is very much important that argent robertson people so means that in his case also you need to remember that you need to examine at least the people reflexes are intact so you can say this arp is excluded so your diagnosis is not the type of parasite not the neurocephalus that i&amp;#39;m talking about yes my reductive pudding and keeping all the important features single single features you can make out the diagnosis the cm fast but you include your diagnosis the frederick sedaxia yes my dear doctor listen very carefully as because i said that predicts ataxia is a clinical diagnosis and you can confirm it by doing the genetic test so you need to exclude the other differential diagnosis the most importantly the spinal cord pathology that you need to execute and doing an mri scan of the spinal cord and sometimes doing an mri scan of the brain is really needed to exit the other type but the most important diagnostic test to exclude the other possible differential diagnosis is a spinal cord mri so yeah spider doctor we have done the spinal cord mri in this case and so that we can understand this is a real case of fredericksontaxia is diagnosed critically so now i&amp;#39;d like to show the spine mri and you see the spine mri and all the you see the film is here and there are a lot of films so i don&amp;#39;t want to show the all the films all together i&amp;#39;d like to show the films showed that nothing at all no abnormality found in the spinal cord pathology that the same intensity is found so that&amp;#39;s why i&amp;#39;d like to show and look at here the findings of this patient right so see the findings are suggestive the grade one spondylolisthesis of l5 over s1 particle so once again grade one spondylolisthesis of l5 over s1 even scoriosis having rightward convexity so that is in kyphosis is only the findings but you see very close findings you see the spine is written the spinal cord shows the normal in outline and homogenous signal intensity so once again spinal cord shows normally now psi outline and homogenous signal intensity so spinal cord is normal in findings so showing that the spinal cord normal so we can exclude the other findings of the c m fast all together means the c for cervical myopathy and for multiple sclerosis and once again tradition actually is the clinical diagnosis here and the subject combined degenerate spinal cord and lastly the table process so the spinal cord mri is really important to exert the other differential diagnosis so here only the findings is the sky for scoriasis and no other findings the spinal cord is normal so that is the findings i&amp;#39;d like to emphasize so that we can make our diagnosis predict structure",

Community Education specialist at MDA we are thrilled to have you with us today for this webinar this learning series is part of our larger MDA Community Education programming which focuses on bringing theur muscular disease Community together around education and resources be sure to visit the Community Education section on mda.org for updates on upcoming events and um other uh future programs we are recording today&amp;#39;s event and we&amp;#39;ll be posting it to the website for on demand viewing at a later date please know that all phone lines have been muted but we will have a question and answer session at the end of the webinar you can use the chat feature to type in your questions and feel free to um to send those in as you think of them they&amp;#39;ll all be addressed after the presentation I would also like to thank our webinar supporter Riata Pharmaceuticals we would not be able to provide Community Education webinars like this if not for their generous support and we are very thankful and appreciative for over 70 years NDA has led the way in accelerating research advancing care and advocating for the support of our families mda&amp;#39;s mission is to empower people living with muscular distrophy ALS and related neuromuscular diseases to live longer more independent lives our mission comes to life through these four pillars of care Champion Catalyst and Community if you haven&amp;#39;t done so already we invite you to join the MDA Community by registering with us I would now like to introduce today&amp;#39;s guest Jennifer Farmer Jen is the chief executive officer of the fried&amp;#39;s attack research Alliance Jen has a master&amp;#39;s degree in genetic counseling and as a genetic counselor developed a special interest in neurogenetic conditions and then went on to establish and coordinate clinical and research programs for individuals and families diagnosed with fa and other neurodegenerative diseases having established relationships with the families who founded F and sharing in their Vision to treat and cure fa she joined the organization full-time in 2006 she has led their efforts to establish clinical research infrastructure and clinical Tri Readiness grown the research grant program LED efforts to engage biopharma industry in FA drug Discovery and development and ured highly efficient and transparent organizational growth and development in her current role as CEO she helps to carry out the Strategic Mission at the organization through leading research and partnership initiatives we are so excited to have you here today Jen I&amp;#39;ll now throw the time over to you Kayla thank you so much for that nice introduction um and I&amp;#39;m really grateful to MDA for inviting me to participate in in this webinar series and hopefully my slides where did they go will come back up they are open um let&amp;#39;s see come on now uh oh there we go all right hopefully you are seeing my slides in presentation mode now yes perfect excellent well thank you all for joining us this evening and for this three-part series those of you who this is your third night in a row I&amp;#39;m super impressed and thank you very much for for hanging with me um again I really want to emphasize the importance of partnership um Farah and MDA have had a long history of collaboration in advancing research um for friederick Z taxia and tonight&amp;#39;s webinar is just another great example of that partnership I also just want to quickly mention that one of the resources I&amp;#39;m going to be talking about this evening our clinical trial guide um was developed with the support of funding from the fizer foundation so Farah for those of you who don&amp;#39;t know is a nonprofit research organization um our mission is to advance research to treat and cure fa and we believe that to be successful in this Mission we need individuals and families living with fa engaged alongside the research community so very much like what you heard the MDA Mission and bringing our organ bringing all these stakeholders together in collaboration so for tonight&amp;#39;s session I&amp;#39;m going to give a super fast tour um just a quick overview in case folks didn&amp;#39;t participate on Tuesday a little background about fa then I&amp;#39;m going to dive into how we think about developing treatments what the current status of This research is especially for programs that are currently being tested in clinical trials I&amp;#39;ll highlight some of the studies that are ongoing in recruiting as well as some that have some recent results that have been reported out and then we&amp;#39;ll talk more broadly about participation in clinical trials and the resources that are available to you as you&amp;#39;re trying to you know figure out um when and how to be involved in research and and some resources that um can make sure that you stay connected to clinical research and I will also make sure I end in time so that we can have some Q&amp;amp;A and discussion at the end so friedrick sat taxi is a rare Progressive neurodegenerative disease it affects about 150,000 people so that&amp;#39;s about 4,000 in the US and 15,000 worldwide it is caused by mutations in a single Gene and that Gene codes for the protein for toxin it is a progressive disease it typically has onset of symptoms between the ages of seven and 15 um but due to the progressive nature results in significant disability and also can be life shortening due to cardiomyopathy which if you tuned in last night um Dr Lynn talked about the cardiomyopathy associated with fredrix sat taxia so even though we think about fa as neurodegenerative it really is multi-stem everyone with fa will develop neurological symptoms specifically a taxia so trouble coordinating movement of the arms and legs um Dr Lynch explained this the first night is the information coming in from your peripheral nervous system to your brain um that that communication pathway is not functioning right that&amp;#39;s where um Fredrick a taxia is most impacted in the central nervous system is in the coordination of movement and communication where you are in space between your brain and your your limbs most individuals with fa also have fatigue um many also have impaired speech vision and hearing scoliosis and heart disease can be present in more than 50% of individuals and about 10% of individuals with fa also have diabetes I included this picture at the bottom um not to make you all neuroanatomists but um to point out that even though it&amp;#39;s a a neurodegenerative disease that degeneration doesn&amp;#39;t start when the symptoms start um we actually now understand that um some of the changes that take place in the nervous system are occurring even before symptoms develop and this is what makes early diagnosis and treatment so important so friedrick aexi as I mentioned is an inherited Condition it&amp;#39;s caused by mutations in a gene called ferin we all have the ferin gene we all have two copies of it one from Mom one from Dad we all have um in our F taxin Gene a repeating sequence of the DNA called GAA usually there&amp;#39;s about seven to 30 GAA repeats in the gene individuals with fredri at taxia these repeats have gotten expanded there can be hundreds more than a thous thousand of these GAA repeats in the middle of the Gene and that results in the gene not being allowed to be transcribed or red and the result is that the gene can&amp;#39;t make its protein for taxin so friederick at taxia is really caused by a deficiency of this ferin protein um but that deficiency is ultimately caused by genetic mutations in this Gene the F taxin protein is really important Gene it is um evolutionarily conserved so almost all organisms require the ferin gene or an analog of ferin um and that&amp;#39;s because the fer taxin protein is incredibly important in energy production in the cells um not just energy production but lots of other cellular functions most of which are carried out in a part of the cell called the mitochondria so if we try and tie this Al together there&amp;#39;s this GAA repeat expansion in the ferin gene that results in a deficiency of this important critical protein for taxin and that protein you know because it&amp;#39;s not there in sufficient quantity there are impairments in mitochondrial function and the consequences of you know Pathways being altered could mean that there also buildup of toxins like reactive oxygen species and the result is that the cells don&amp;#39;t have enough energy the cells are not functioning properly and that results in the symptoms that individuals with fa experience so when we think about targeting therapies for frix at taxia um we always start with symptoms right we we start with how you feel um the things that you would want improved so better balance better coordination treating the heart disease treating diabetes um but we can also think about developing treatments by understanding the biology and T developing therapies that can Target um either the cellular Pathways that are dysfunctional or the protein or the gene itself and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve been doing for the last 20 years this is the same picture this is the same Cascade of events but we&amp;#39;ve colorcoded it and I&amp;#39;ll show you why in a minute but I&amp;#39;ve also just tried to give you examples of how at each point we think about developing different types of therapies for fa and it&amp;#39;s important for us to have multiple different therapeutic strategies um while fa might be um a more simplistic genetic disease in that it&amp;#39;s caused by only one Gene and most people with fa have the same genetic mutation it&amp;#39;s still a complex disease it affects multiple organ systems um many of you know that not everybody with fa has the same progression has the same symptom manifestations not everybody gets the cardiomyopathy or the diabetes and so you know we really need to think about having a diverse and deep treatment strategy um if we really want to ultimately treat and cure this disease the other way that we also think about treating this disease is to slow stop and reverse the progression and in order to do that again we believe we&amp;#39;re going to need multiple treatment strategies so we had colorcoded um this Cascade of events or this Cascade of different um treatment targets because it we have this treatment Pipeline and we wanted to match up sort of these different targets with how we think about um what&amp;#39;s ongoing in our treatment Pipeline and so next slide has a better view of that for you and so up here at the top are different treatments that are currently being tested that Target mitochondrial function then there are treatments that are targeting metabolic pathways trying to replace F toxin protein increased gene expression and then genetic therapies down here at the bottom um in Orange this treatment pipeline if it&amp;#39;s the first time you&amp;#39;re seeing it um progresses from left to right in terms of how far along in development it is everything over here on the left is still being studied in the lab whereas in the middle we&amp;#39;re testing these um Therapies in individuals with fa um in clinical trials and then our goal is to get to approved treatments so I&amp;#39;m going to spend some time going through um the status of some of these treatments that are in development Dr Lynch talked about this one um in his presentation on Tuesday so om lox alone is um a drug that is the first treatment that has been approved for friedrick sat taxia and individuals 16 and older and we have a little um YouTube video that explains the mechanism of omav alox alone but essentially um omav targets um a pathway called Nrf2 that is not functioning properly in FA and so omaveloxolone activates this Nrf2 pathway which can improve the mitochondrial function decrease oxidative stress and reduce inflammation so we understand the mechanism by which this drug works and that&amp;#39;s important we&amp;#39;ve also conducted three clinical trials of omaveloxolone and Dr Lynch went through these these results the other night so I&amp;#39;m going to just quickly remind you that um the Mox part two study demonstrated that individuals taking omav for one year compared to the placebo group um showed Improvement and stabilization on neurologic function as measured by the modified friederick sat taxia rating scale compared to controls then there was a follow-on open label extension study when people finished this Phase 2 this part two double blind Placebo control trial everybody rolled into an open label extension where they were followed for many years um out even now Beyond three years but we did a study where um we compared everyone taking omalo loone in the open label extension to match Natural History control subjects so that we can understand what happens even after one year when people are taking omab and what you see is that again this is looking at the modified Frick&amp;#39;s a taxia rating scale so people taking omav progressed slower or had less change on their neurologic scale and or neurologic function compared to matched Natural History control subjects and so this is telling us that um we you know the the way part of the way that omav is helping people is slowing the progression of the neurologic disease the drug was approved by the FDA in the United States on February 28th and is now available to individuals 16 and older living in the us as we mentioned earlier fa is a global disease and so Riata has also started to pursue approvals outside the US in Europe we understand as well that we need to um have drugs approved not only you know in the US and Europe but in other regions of the world where there are people living with fa and and that&amp;#39;s an active area of activity to extend this approval globally I also mentioned that the drug has been approved in individuals 16 and older and that means that we&amp;#39;re going to need more studies of omav um specifically in individuals less than 16 so that hopefully we can see if omav has the same benefit and safety profile in children as it did in adults and hopefully make the drug available to Children if it is safe and efficacious I also just wanted to make everyone aware um that there&amp;#39;s a change that&amp;#39;s going to be happening um it was recently announced that Biogen um another pH pH ceutical company is going to acquire Riata Pharmaceuticals and so if you start hearing about the Biogen drug or the Biogen trial um that is the same thing as what we&amp;#39;ve been talking about um but it&amp;#39;s just that Biogen has now acquired riia Pharmaceuticals and Sky Claris so I&amp;#39;m going to talk about a few other treatment approaches that are in this area of improving mitochondrial function the next one is called vinone or PTC 743 so this drug also uh functions in the mitochondria but differently than omaveloxolone this drug specifically um targets what&amp;#39;s called lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis and so these are other Downstream consequences of f taxin deficiency PTC just completed um a global phase three clinical trial and reported out results earlier this year so the move at a clinical trial um enrolled over 120 individuals with fa and evaluated them in a double blind Placebo control trial for 72 weeks which is about a year and a half again um individuals are randomized one to one Placebo to drug and then at the end of the 72 weeks um everybody was in was rolled over or enrolled into an open label extension study for an additional 24 weeks so the results that were reported out just a few months ago by PTC um compare the individuals taking omab that&amp;#39;s um so here here two graphs um one is the one on the the right is of the whole study population this study enrolled individuals seven years of age and older with fa and so there was a big age group um enrolled in the study but there was a pre-specified primary analysis group so the majority of individuals enrolled and the primary analysis group was individuals age 7 to 21 and what you&amp;#39;re looking at here are several different outcomes measures that were looked at in the study so the modified Frick&amp;#39;s taxia rating scale or neurologic function scale activities of daily living fatigue and a one minute walk test and here you can see that all the outcome measures that were measured um people taking vinone scored a little bit better than people taking the placebo however that Improvement was only statistically significant for a measure of upright stability gate and balance and an improvement in fatigue in the primary analysis group so PTC has um told us that they have requested a meeting with the FDA to discuss these results and that they are going to continue to collect data in the open label extension there&amp;#39;s another um clinical trial and treatment approach ongoing to improve mitochondrial function this one is evaluating exercise and a supplement called nicotinamide riboside and again the goal of both the exercise and the supplement are to improve mitochondrial function and cellular energy this study is being conducted at the Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia it&amp;#39;s funded by the National Institutes of Health they are enrolling um individuals with fa age 7 to 40 you do have to be able to exercise um using a recumbent trike um you don&amp;#39;t have to go you know out on the road with the trike um they give you a trainer a stationary trainer so that you can do the exercise in your home and they give you training and support um in in the exercise individuals enrolled in the study are randomized to either exercise supplement uh both exercise and supplement or to placebo and studied for 12 weeks and they&amp;#39;re looking at a lot of different outcome measures they&amp;#39;re trying to look at um you know do does exercise or the um supplement improve muscle function heart function urance um overall you know quality of life well-being so there are a lot of different outcome measures being assessed by this study they&amp;#39;re going to be continuing enrollment through the end of this year and into next year and so there&amp;#39;s still an opportunity to participate and if you&amp;#39;re interested um all the studies that I have listed here all the contact information you&amp;#39;ll be able to access that after the webinar when uh the link for the recording is shared so um don&amp;#39;t worry about having to write anything down as I&amp;#39;m going through this you&amp;#39;ll have all this information this information is also available on our website the next um treatment approach that I&amp;#39;d like to talk to you about is a ferin replacement approach so we talked about how in FA um the ferin protein is deficient well unfortunately this protein can&amp;#39;t be supplemented through diet um or you know by taking supplements and so but what they have been able to do is actually make the fer taxin protein and put it in a a cargo vehicle with a special mitochondrial targeting sequence so that they can actually deliver the protein into the cell and then into the mitochondria itself so the first clinical trials um were completed about um a year or two ago it was a phase one study where they looked at single doses um of the drug at single administration of the drug at different Doses and then also looked at um multiple doses over a short period of time and the phase one study concluded that it was safe and well tolerated um in the doses that were studied over that short period of time and that has allowed the program to move forward now to where it is today into a phase two study the goal of the phase two study is to really look at safety and dose now over a longer period of time and currently there are two doses being studied the first dose is 25 milligram dose that study was actually completed earlier this year and larar reported out those results just recently um showing that it was again well tolerated and that there was an increase in F toxin from Baseline that they could measure um in skin cells and buckle cells which are uh the cells inside your cheek so they&amp;#39;re now evaluating a second dose a higher dose 50 milligrams again they&amp;#39;re studying it over 28 days individuals are getting the drug every day for 14 days and then every other day it&amp;#39;s a subcutaneous injection meaning that it&amp;#39;s given into the skin kind of like the the way you administer insulin and they&amp;#39;re looking at F taxin levels again in the skin in the Buckle cells they&amp;#39;re monitoring for safety um and this study is ongoing right now um quite literally there&amp;#39;s a cohort of about eight people currently in the study um being dosed and evaluated and then the second group um coming in for the phase Phase 2 second cohort uh will start in October and so I believe even though the study is ongoing I believe they have identified now the individuals that they need for for the phase 2 second cohort they are also going to be starting um at the end of this year beginning of next year what&amp;#39;s called an open label extension study and this will allow them to evaluate again both safety and tolerability over a much longer period of time um and start to look to see if the the drug has any um efficacy or can improve symptoms of fa the open label extension will recruit people who participated in the phase one and the phase two study the next um investigational drug I want to talk about is DT 216 which is being developed by Design Therapeutics um this drug is also sometimes called a gene Tac um and what this drug does is it interacts with the gene at the at the GAA repeat and allows for the gene to be transcribed if you remember back to earlier in my presentation I mentioned that part of the problem with these repeats is that it silences the Gene and doesn&amp;#39;t allow enough for taxin protein to get made well this drug you can kind of think of as a bridge or um a gene activator and so even though the repeats are there it allows Gene transcription to occur and with more Gene transcription there should be more for tax and protein made they recently completed um a phase one study and I am sharing this slide with you um this is from the company&amp;#39;s recent presentation of results just to share with you kind of the what&amp;#39;s involved in a phase one study um of a new drug that&amp;#39;s never been tested in people before the first thing that we have to do is we have to test just single administrations of the drug at different Doses and here you see they had to um test six different doses of the drug with each of these um groupings or cohorts you enroll about six to eight individuals and you study them um once you give them the drug for usually you know a short period of time a week to a month and then once you finish the first cohort you can go to the second cohort and the third cohort and so so a lot of times what you might see is studies appearing to like start and stop like we&amp;#39;re asking people to volunteer for a study and then we come back and ask again and we ask again and that might be because we&amp;#39;re trying to enroll for all of these different cohorts um but you can you can see the complexity and the commitment that it takes um to participate in these kinds of studies and then these multiple ascending dose studies again we&amp;#39;re testing different um different doses of the drug but for longer periods of time and here the the drug was tested um over the course of a month with um IV injections once a week for three weeks so um the company reported out that um the the sorry um the company reported out the results of this study and that generally gt21 six was well tolerated um there were injection sight reactions that were observed and I&amp;#39;ll talk a little bit more about them in a minute um but also importantly that they were able to observe by looking um within um muscle samples obtained from patients that the drug was able to do what it&amp;#39;s supposed to do right they were able to demonstrate what&amp;#39;s called proof of concept that the drug gets into tissue and it can increase F taxin now the increases in F taxin that they saw um were encouraging but they would like to get the fer taxin levels higher which means that they would like to use higher doses but because of the injection site reactions um they didn&amp;#39;t want to use higher doses of the current formulation of the drug um and they actually been working on improved formulation of the drug that would allow them to use these higher doses and so for now the study&amp;#39;s concluded and they&amp;#39;re going to um finish up the work that they need and on the preclinical side um to be able to move forward with this improved formulation that will hopefully be more well tolerated um and more suited to Chronic treatment in higher doses so you&amp;#39;ll be hearing about dt26 coming back early next year into clinical trials the next um research study I would like to share with you is being conducted by two different groups lexio Therapeutics and wild Cornell Medical School it is a first inum study of investigational gene therapy to treat the cardiomyopathy of fa this is uh the first gene therapy trials to occur in FA this is really exciting um we&amp;#39;ve been you know doing a lot of research MDA and fair a have been investing in research studies and to advance Gene therapies across many neuromuscular diseases for a very long time um and so it&amp;#39;s a big milestone that we now have our first gene therapy trial in in in clinical first gene therapy in clinical trials this is a phase one study um it is enrolling individuals with fa 18 and older who have um signs of cardiomyopathy there&amp;#39;s um a very detailed inclusion exclusion criteria um and there&amp;#39;s more information available um for you through several webinars that we have on our website um that you&amp;#39;re able to access or by calling the study sites it is a 52 week study with fouryear followup it&amp;#39;s a one-time IV Administration they have completed testing um the first do dose cohort and they are now enrolling for cohorts 2 and three um a few people have asked about you know why are there two studies um so it turns out that they are um collaborating um the these two groups are collaborating it is the same gene product and it is the same route of administration an IV dose there are different um and they are all they are both evaluating both safety dose and efficacy but there are differences in the inclusion and exclusion criteria across the two studies as well as the efficacy assessments so for example in the lexio study um they&amp;#39;re doing cardiac biopsies before treatment and after treatment to be able to you know study how much F taxin has gone up in the heart tissue with the treatment um so there there are differences between the two studies so it&amp;#39;s important to take the time to evaluate both of the studies and see which one you know might be um the best fit for you if this is something that you&amp;#39;re interested in there are currently five sites open for the lexio study and then at Wild Cornell in New York again this information will be available to you and there are like I said two webinars um on our website that you can access to learn more about this I want to spend just a few minutes talking about gene therapy um as I mentioned earlier MDA and Farah have been investigating Gene therapies to treat conditions like fa for a very long time and Gene therapies come in different types of gene therapies they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re not all the same um sometimes when we talk talk about gene therapy we&amp;#39;re talking about replacing the abnormal Gene and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on in this in the study I mentioned to treat the cardiomyopathy um they&amp;#39;re taking a correct copy of the ferin gene putting it in a virus and then injecting that through into the bloodstream so that it can you know travel to the heart um other types of gene therapies and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s called invivo gene therapy when we directly administer a correct copy of the gene um by using a viral Vector usually intravenous or uh sometimes it&amp;#39;s intrathecal into the spinal fluid it can be um they&amp;#39;ve treated some uh inherited eye diseases by directly injecting the gene therapy into the eye um but that&amp;#39;s invivo that&amp;#39;s what we mean by invivo X Vio is when we take cells out of somebody correct those cells and then give you back the corrected cells that&amp;#39;s xvivo gene therapy um and xvivo Gene therapies um have traditionally been used to treat um certain types of neuromuscular conditions that um are that that have a more metabolic nature where the genes or the proteins that are lacking are are secreted and so if you can give some of the cells back um they&amp;#39;ll secrete the Protein that&amp;#39;s needed to the other cells in the body but it turns out that um you can also use xvivo Gene therapies for neurodegenerative diseases as well because if you transplant back stem cells those stem cells can go to the nervous system and become supporting cells for the cells that are not functional properly and that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re evaluating xfo Gene therapies um for fa as well and then finally there&amp;#39;s Gene editing um where we&amp;#39;re not replacing the gene but we&amp;#39;re delivering um Gene editing tools you&amp;#39;ve probably heard of crisper um that&amp;#39;s a type of Gene editing tool to correct the genetic mutation and so we&amp;#39;re evaluating all of these different types of gene Therapies in fa and you&amp;#39;ll be I think hearing more about this over the next few years as these programs move from the lab to the clinic there um are important advantages um as well as disadvantages when it comes to gene therapy obviously um it&amp;#39;s exciting because we are trying you know we are attacking the disease at its root cause and hopefully um causing you know a a permanent kind of Correction so that hopefully these treatments will only have to be applied once however these treatments um are not reversible they are irreversible so if there&amp;#39;s a problem we we can&amp;#39;t undo it it doesn&amp;#39;t wash out over time right now we have to use viruses to deliver these Gene therapies or these editing tools and there can be a risk of an immune response um to the virus or there can be of Target effects of some of these therapies and so it&amp;#39;s really important that we take the time to develop the best possible therapies before we begin clinical trials we want you to be aware we want to provide you with educational resources to help you understand more about gene therapy um I can&amp;#39;t in five 10 minutes tell you everything you need to know obviously and even if I spent this whole hour talking about gene therapy it probably would wouldn&amp;#39;t be enough um but MDA and Farah both have a lot of Educational Tools available for you to learn more about gene therapy um there&amp;#39;s a whole series on the MDA website that guides you through understanding different aspects of gene therapy um Farah also has a whole uh guided tutorial um on gene therapy where you can get more information so my final a few minutes um I want to just talk a little bit more generally about other types of research and how to be involved so all of the research I&amp;#39;ve talked about involve clinical trials where you&amp;#39;re testing an intervention in someone um a specific drug or treatment or device but there are other types of research that are really important as well and Dr Lynch talked about this a little bit on Tuesday um other types of clinical studies or clinical research um can be observational studies like Natural History studies biomarker studies and these studies are just as important as clinical trials and I would even argue they&amp;#39;re not only just as important but over the long term they might even be more important because they can have a bigger impact over a longer period of time an impact over all our drug development not just one specific program we wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do all the clinical trials I just told you about if we hadn&amp;#39;t already started these natural history and biomarker studies um so if you don&amp;#39;t qualify for a clinical trial um it doesn&amp;#39;t mean you can&amp;#39;t be involved in research in fact anyone with Frederick&amp;#39;s at taxia can participate in research there&amp;#39;s a natural history study that is open and enrolling globally um it previously we called called this natural history study fa comms in the US and eax in Europe um but we just recently combined these two natural history studies into one and so the natural history study is now called unify um it&amp;#39;s the same study ongoing it just has a new name this study involves collecting information from you about your medical history performing exams neurological exams functional exams uh things like Vision speech uh cardiac exams collecting uh samples for biomarker studies blood skin uh those Buckle cells so again anyone can participate um in the natural history study is a once a year visit and um there are many sites in the US um as well as globally and hopefully um if you have not heard about this you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll visit visit the website and learn a little bit more and think about participating in a natural history study so in the last few minutes um I also want to share with you our clinical trials guide so we&amp;#39;ve talked about all these different types of research um and ways you can be involved and you know none of these treatments will get to approval like Sky Claris without individuals with fa volunteering for these studies and participating and research but we want to make sure you do so um in in a safe and and transparent way and make sure that you have the tools and resources you need to understand what it means to participate in a clinical trial and that you&amp;#39;ve really investigated the clinical trial and thought about the participation you know beforehand and so that&amp;#39;s what really this guide is about um it&amp;#39;s a tool to help you learn more about Tri and there&amp;#39;s um a way for you to kind of it walks you through the things you really need to think about and for those of you who like me um enjoy paper not online reading we also have um print copies available and we&amp;#39;ve translated this guide into nine different languages the guide goes through the drug development process so you know we give you some background on what it means to develop a drug um what the general timeline is what it might look like we talk about the importance of clinical trials why our clinical trials have to be randomized Placebo controlled um what it means to be a good clinical trial participant it&amp;#39;s really important that these studies um remain unbiased and and that you know we follow the rules of these studies these are experiments there&amp;#39;s um a glossery of terms to know I&amp;#39;ve already tossed around a ton of different terms this evening in this presentation and so um we want you know we want to be able to give you a guide to all the different acronyms and and words that that gets get thrown around during trials we explain the different phases of Trials as well um so phase one as you&amp;#39;ve probably picked up from the presentation are the first types of clinical trials that get done in people and they&amp;#39;re primarily look at safety and dose of the drug As you move on to phase two and phase three we start looking at the effectiveness of the drug is it is it having a benefit do people feel better how do those benefits compare to the side effects of the drug ultimately those clinical trials produce the data that&amp;#39;s needed to get drugs approved but even once drugs are approved there can also be studies that go on afterwards to understand what happens in a broader population of people um taking the drug and over a longer period of time there are lots of different players involved in clinical trials um including you the participant um and this just kind of takes you through who all the different players are what their roles and responsibilities are how um all the different players are you know what their role is specifically related to you know maintaining safety in the context of a clinical trial again I talked about you the participant um kind of understanding what your responsibilities are when you&amp;#39;re in a clinical trial and so we have kind of a little dos and don&amp;#39;ts like a you know what what&amp;#39;s good clinical participation and then at the very end there&amp;#39;s a several pages that take you through um the informed consent process and this is kind of your companion guide to help you think think of what are the questions I should be asking so that I really understand what this trial is about what my time commitments going to be what procedures would be performed you know what um what are the risks and benefits will there be costs um all of those different things that are going to be important to deciding whether or not you can participate in a clinical trial we&amp;#39;ve put together in a guided um in a guided way with questions to kind of help you talk to your physician or the study um site about the trial there are lots of places where you can find information about all of these studies MDA has a clinical trial finder on the website you just type in Frederick&amp;#39;s aexa answer a few questions and you&amp;#39;ll find all the clinical trials that you&amp;#39;re matched with faal lists all the ongoing fa Clin clinical trials on our website we also have a patient registry if you enroll in the patient registry you&amp;#39;ll get emails from us about about clinical trials and then um the NIH also has a website called clinicaltrials.gov and every single clinical trial um that that occurs in the US is registered on clinical trials.gov so I just encourage you to stay informed through events like this one um following Farah and MDA on social media um signing up for newsletters is a great way to keep up on all this information going forward and always um please feel feel free to reach out to us if we can be a further help um provide information to you and so with that I&amp;#39;d like to thank you for your attention and open it up for questions all right thank you so much for that wonderful information that&amp;#39;s a lot of really helpful um information um and this will be posted later on for on demand viewing so those QR codes you&amp;#39;ll be able to access those um in the future um so while we&amp;#39;re waiting for some questions to come in in the chat we did have some um come in with registration so um somebody has asked um is there anything that can be done to get quicker access to treatment for young children my kids are deteriorating deteriorating and there An approved treatment yeah that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a great question um so it is important that even though the Drug&amp;#39;s been approved in individuals 16 and older that we do um test it in children before it gets approved we don&amp;#39;t we can&amp;#39;t assume that the dose that&amp;#39;s been used in adults is going to be the right dose for kids um but we completely agree with you that we need to have these treatments available to Children um and so we&amp;#39;ve been working closely with Riata to start a clinical trial in children with fa hope those studies will start by the end of this year early next year some of the other trials um that I talked about were being done in kids so for example the 743 study vinone that was done in individuals seven and older so if you know that drug um moves forward I would expect you know that that could be a potential therapy available for children if it if it moves forward um the exercise study is being conducted in children ages 10 and older so there there are some options for children at this point to participate in research studies even clinical trials um and you know hopefully we will have clinical trial of omaveloxolone starting soon that children will also be able to enroll in all right and a lot of these questions that came in with registration you you&amp;#39;ve probably already answered but that&amp;#39;s okay if we repeat um it&amp;#39;s a lot of um really important questions um so somebody asked how close are we to finding a cure is there progress towards fers under age 16 to start Sky Claris and are there gene therapy options for fa yeah so that our goal is to you know find a cure to ultimately um you know slow stop and reverse um the damage that occurs in Frederick&amp;#39;s at taxia um we do have a first approved treatment that slows the progression of fa and a lot of those other treatments that I reviewed will hopefully be added onto Sky Claris um to get us closer to the treatments that will stop progression and hopefully if we start it early you know early enough um really transform the disease and and get us closer to to cures but those are they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re all in development they are coming the other thing I think is important for folks to to think about you know it it took us a lot longer than we thought to get Sky Claris approved obviously and you know at least I&amp;#39;ve been doing I&amp;#39;ve been working in the friedrick community for 25 years and I we certainly didn&amp;#39;t think it would take us this long to have a first approved therapy but you know that first approved therapy is will hopefully be the one that does take the longest and the others that follow on will will come quicker because there&amp;#39;s a lot we&amp;#39;ve learned through this process that will benefit all the other therapies that come behind it and so you know if you think about the first time you do anything it&amp;#39;s always the the slowest and maybe your your most efficient effort and as you continue to iterate you get you get smarter you get more efficient and the timeline gets better and so I think that&amp;#39;s another important thing for folks to understand with this first approved therapy is that it will hopefully accelerate progress for the other therapies following behind it all right um somebody has asked what&amp;#39;s the most successful route of treatment and what is the life expectancy um the current life expectancy for someone with fa on average is about 35 years but that is very different across everybody that is just an average and that early mortality is most often caused by cardiomyopathy and not everybody with fa has cardiomyopathy which is which is why that&amp;#39;s you know that number is not the same for everybody um I&amp;#39;m sorry remind me of the first question again um what&amp;#39;s the most successful route of treatment um you know it&amp;#39;s hard to know um because these are all currently being studied so um you know we we need more time and more Trials of all these therapies to know which are going to you know have the most potential for or have the most therapeutic impact it&amp;#39;s possible that some will work better and some people than others some might work uh better for the heart or better for the nervous system um so you know I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s so easy to just say one&amp;#39;s going to be the best I think it&amp;#39;s a what&amp;#39;s important is that we have a lot of different treatment approaches that can work together in combination okay um somebody asked a really interesting question is when you&amp;#39;re trying a treatment how do you know if there&amp;#39;s a difference what are the long-term side effects and do they outweigh what you&amp;#39;re trying to accomplish especially in older adults you know those are those are questions that hopefully we can answer in clinical trials um or or through you know once a Drug&amp;#39;s approved through postmarket studies um most clinical trials are conducted over a relatively short period of time one year maybe one one to two years because we want to be able to get these drugs approved um so we don&amp;#39;t ultimately know you know what the potential side effects may be if we take these medicines for five or 10 or 20 years um but there are often studies that get started after these drugs are approved that allow us to study over a longer period of time to see if there are additional risks or side effects that that come from taking these medicines for for a longer period of time and so you know the the answer is you know these are these are things we have to study but we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t know them at the outset um if that makes sense it does thank you um so we&amp;#39;ve had a few questions come in in the chat um somebody has asked um how can patients access the therapy if they&amp;#39;re outside the United States um this person was in Latin America so right now um it is not possible to access Sky Claris um if you&amp;#39;re outside the United States um but you know one of one of the initiatives that Riata started after the US approval is approval in other countries outside the US and I think one of the um advantages now that you know of having Biogen come in and acquire Riata and acquire Sky Claris um Biogen has uh drugs approved globally for neuromuscular diseases and so they already have teams in place globally um to pursue regulatory approvals and Manufacturing and access at a global scale and so I&amp;#39;m excited that you know with Biogen coming on that they&amp;#39;ll be able to help get Sky Claris to more people globally in a shorter period of time all right and somebody&amp;#39;s asked a question about the exercise study um and asked if that age requirement is is a firm requirement they&amp;#39;re 51 and active um yes um unfortunately the the age requirement is firm um they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re not able to to change the study requirements at this point in time un I know it&amp;#39;s frustrating A lot of times people want to volunteer for studies and there&amp;#39;s something in the inclusion exclusion criteria whether it&amp;#39;s age or you know another symptom that they might have that might exclude them from participating um but it&amp;#39;s important that we have you know inclusion exclusion criteria for these trials because you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re trying to in a disease like fa that can affect people you know from ages five past well past the 50s I even know people with fa in their 70s and 80s um that that we have a homogeneous group of people so that we&amp;#39;re trying to measure the same thing in all the individuals who were in The Trial um so unfortunately in this case it it is a firm criteria but there are other studies that individuals who are um over 40 can participate in like the larar study or the lexio study all right um we have just a couple minutes left right now we only have one question left so we&amp;#39;ll um get to that one somebody asked about the natural history study if that&amp;#39;s done yearly for how many years or if that&amp;#39;s indefinite um so I was I actually helped get the natural history study started back in 2003 when I was still working at University of Pennsylvania and children&amp;#39;s hospital so it started 20 years ago it&amp;#39;s still ongoing today um and that study is is open and enrolling it includes um one visit a year at one of the clinical sites and again those visits include things like assessing neurologic function cardiac function collecting blood samples answering questionnaires um uh let&amp;#39;s see where did I get to all the points in the question um you did there is there is sometimes travel support to help people um who have to travel a far distance to get to one of the natural history study sites and the only requirement is that you have Fredick pexia there&amp;#39;s no age requirements or any other requirements on inclusion exclusion all right wonderful um so we are coming up right on 7 o&amp;#39; so we got to almost all the questions um Jennifer again thank you so much for that wonderful presentation um we are so appreciative of your time uh we are so glad you&amp;#39;re here with us to share your expertise and we are so appreciative for everything you do for the neuromuscular Community Kaya thank you and thanks MDA for inviting me and thank you to everyone who joined this evening thank you um I would also like to

    "transcript": "hello i&amp;#39;m susan walther director of patient engagement at farah in this education module i will be reviewing the inheritance of friedrichs ataxia for so many families receiving a diagnosis of fa is a shock because there was no indication of the condition in the family medical history additionally we all know genetics makes us who we are however very few of us are prepared to hear that a mutation in a single gene in our genetic makeup can cause a progressive neurodegenerative condition affecting the whole body in a separate education module the frataxin gene is reviewed with specifics of the mutation types in this module i will provide an overview of how these mutation types are passed from parent to child and what the risks are to having additional affected children once the diagnosis of fa is known this is a picture of a karyotype where the chromosomes have been removed from the nucleus of the cell and lined up in pairs one copy of a chromosome is inherited from a person&amp;#39;s mother and the second copy is inherited from the person&amp;#39;s father the human genome project analyzed all the genes on the chromosomes to figure out where each gene is located the frataxin gene is always located on chromosome 9. there are 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes 1 through 22 are the same in both men and women the last pair of chromosomes determines gender in this karyotype there is an x and a y chromosome and this combination yields male gender two x chromosomes would yield female gender i need to state a disclaimer here the concepts i will be describing are the normal processes that occur in the vast majority of cell replication and inheritance there are always exceptions to the rules if everything worked perfectly every time we wouldn&amp;#39;t be talking about rare genetic conditions meiosis is the process of how genes on chromosomes segregate into egg and sperm prior to a child&amp;#39;s conception the process of meiosis is different from the process of replication of cells that takes place in our body replication of cells also known as mitosis is a process where the genes on chromosomes are exactly duplicated and separated into new cells essentially one cell becomes two cells two cells becomes four cells four cells become eight cells and so forth and each cell has the complete set of paired chromosomes like the karyotype seen in the previous slide in meiosis one cell becomes four cells but each of the four cells has only one set of chromosomes 23 instead of 46 the diagram on this slide for simple representation shows only one chromosome throughout the process of meiosis meiosis is an extremely important process it is the process by which we all look different from one another while looking similar to our family members in the beginning of meiosis as seen in the top cell the pairs of chromosomes duplicate at this stage genes can cross over meaning the pattern of genes on the chromosomes are randomly sorted think of this random sorting as the numbered balls in the lottery machine they randomly are blowing around before the chute is opened and the numbered balls line up this random sorting for each chromosome results in each person having their own traits some people in a family might have brown eyes and light brown hair while other family members might have green eyes and dark blonde hair expressions of genes is dependent on its inheritance pattern the concepts of inheritance patterns can be visualized by looking at the genes for eye color recessive inheritance is the pattern of both variants of a gene being the same for example a person with blue eyes has two copies of jeans for eye color that code for blue eyes blue eye color is represented by lower case b here and two lowercase b&amp;#39;s is the genotype the phenotype or the expression of the genes is blue eyes dominant inheritance is the pattern of one variant of a gene masking or overriding the effect of a different variant of the same gene on the other copy of the chromosome for example a person with brown eyes has at least one copy of the gene for the eye color that codes for brown eyes brown eye color is represented here by uppercase b and the genotype can be two genes for brown eyes bb or one g for brown eyes and one gene for blue eyes capital b lowercase b the gene for brown eyes overrides expression of the gene for blue eyes if the gene for brown eyes is present the person will have brown eyes here are more physical traits that have dominant and recessive inheritance it&amp;#39;s interesting to note that for some traits like freckles and earlobes it is far more common that people have two recessive genes than having a dominant gene most people do not have freckles on their face and most people do have attached earlobes traits like eye color freckles hairline and earlobes are considered normal variation meaning these differences and traits do not cause health problems for an individual dominant and recessive inheritance patterns can also be applied to gene expression for physical differences where genetic variation in the gene does cause medical problems for example albinism which has recessive inheritance and where affected people lack production of sufficient melatonin protein an achondroplasia which has dominant inheritance where affected people lack sufficient protein to make a growth factor for adequate bone formation so all this information brings us to the inheritance pattern for phragex ataxia the inheritance pattern for fa is recessive let&amp;#39;s look more closely at what recessive inheritance means for fa dad&amp;#39;s chromosomes contain a copy of the frataxin gene without a mutation represented by the purple color and a copy of the frataxin gene containing a mutation that causes friedrichs ataxia represented by the teal color mom&amp;#39;s chromosomes contain the same frataxin gene copies as dad neither mom nor dad are affected with friedrichs ataxia as is the typical for genetic conditions with recessive inheritance the parents are characterized as carriers for fa remember that meiosis forms egg and sperm with only one copy of each chromosome and therefore one copy of each gene inheritance of genes on chromosomes can occur randomly for each child these parents will conceive in this example the focus is only on inheritance of the frataxin gene on the right is a child colored in teal this child has inherited two copies of the frataxin gene with disease-causing mutations and will develop friedrichs ataxia there is a 25 chance for this inheritance pattern to occur here&amp;#39;s the math for this occurrence one out of two possibilities that&amp;#39;s mom&amp;#39;s egg has the frataxin gene with the mutation teal and one out of two possibilities that dad&amp;#39;s sperm has a frataxin gene with a mutation which is teal so one-half times one-half equals one-fourth or twenty-five percent the same inheritance pattern of twenty-five percent chance can be applied to the child on the left where she did not inherit either fratex and gene with the mutation both of her frataxin genes do not have mutations she will be unaffected by fa and she is not a carrier and she will not have a risk of having a child with fa when she is grown the two children in the middle are carriers for frataxin genes with a disease-causing mutation they are like their parents unaffected by fa there is a 50 chance for this inheritance pattern to occur here&amp;#39;s the math for this occurrence there are one out of two possibilities that mom&amp;#39;s egg has the frataxin gene with the mutation teal dead sperm has the unmutated gene purple one-half chance of teal occurring is 50 chance the child will help be a carrier for moms for tax and mutation the opposite could happen for dad that there&amp;#39;s one out of two possibilities that dad&amp;#39;s sperm has the frataxin gene with the mutation and mom&amp;#39;s egg has the unmutated gene in purple so there&amp;#39;s one half chance that there&amp;#39;ll be the teal gene the mutated gene for frataxin and a 50 chance that the child would be a carrier for deads for tax mutation some important points to note recessive inheritance for phrygics ataxia is not affected by nor does it determine gender of the child the children represented in this diagram could be either gender the 25 percent chance of having a child affected by physics ataxia is an occurrence risk for each individual conception this individual risk means that if a carrier parents have two children both children could be affected or neither child could be affected if carrier parents have five children two could be affected and therefore three could be unaffected or four could be affected and one could be unaffected inheritance is a random pattern and because inheritance is random there is nothing the carrier parents did or didn&amp;#39;t do to cause the children to have rejects ataxia each of us carries several genes for recessive inheritance and unfortunately parents often do not know they are carriers for disease until they have an affected child the question often asked by siblings of an affected individual with phrygics ataxia is what are my chances to have a child affected with fa first step is for the unaffected sibling to have genetic testing to determine carrier status if genetic testing was performed in childhood the test result is still valid if genetic testing needs to be done and the sibling has a partner with whom he or she plans to have a child the best course of action is to meet with a genetic counselor genetic counselors can explain inheritance risks for fa and for other recessive conditions and arrange for genetic testing genetic counselors will also review the family medical histories to identify other inheritance risks here are scenarios for a sibling&amp;#39;s risk for having a child affected with fa sibling is not a carrier for fa risk is negligible for having a child with fa even if the partner is a carrier sibling is a carrier for fa risk is 25 percent for having a child with fa if partner is also a carrier but the risk is negligible if the sibling is a carrier and the partner is not a carrier for fa it can be complicated to understand these inheritance risks and the complication can increase if there are other inheritance risk due to family medical history and other recessive carrier risks please do consider meeting with the genetic counselor to help you sort out all the possible risks what is the risk for someone who is affected with fa to have a child with fa the answer depends on the carrier status of the person&amp;#39;s partner if the partner is not a carrier for fa then all the children will be carriers for fa but not affected if the partner is a carrier for fa then there is a 50 percent chance that a child will be affected with fa here is the math parent affected with fa always passes on for taxing gene with a mutation the carrier partner has one out of two possibilities of passing on the frataxin gene with the mutation thus yielding the 50 risk thank you for engaging with this education module to learn about the inheritance of friedrichs ataxia you can continue your learning with fredrix ataxia by viewing other education modules on

on Frederick&amp;#39;s ATT taxia my name is Kayla white and I&amp;#39;m a Community Education specialist at MDA we&amp;#39;re thrilled to have you join us today for this webinar this learning series is part of our larger MDA Community Education programming which focus on bringing the neuromuscular disease Community together around education and resources be sure to visit the Community Education section on mda.org for updates on upcoming events we are recording today&amp;#39;s event and we&amp;#39;ll be posting it to the website for on demand viewing at a later date please know that all phone lines have been muted but we will have a question and answer session at the end of the webinar you can use the chat feature to type in your questions and feel free to send those in as you think of them they&amp;#39;ll be addressed after the presentation I would also like to thank our webinar supporter Riata Pharmaceuticals we would not be able to provide Community Education webinars like this if not for their gender support and we are very thankful and appreciative for over 70 years MDA has led the way in accelerating research advancing care and advocating for the support of our families mda&amp;#39;s mission is to empower people living with muscular distrophy ALS and related neuromuscular diseases to live longer more independent lives our mission comes to life through these first these four pillars First Care through are a national network of MDA Care Centers across the us we support individuals and families from day one of their Journey second Champion through our advocacy and education efforts we Empower families with information and resources third Catalyst through our investments and research we are furthering advancements and treatment discoveries and fourth community Through programs like summer camp our connections program and our community events we are helping individuals and families build supportive connections and relationships if you haven&amp;#39;t done so already we invite you to join the MDA Community by registering with us I would now like to introduce today&amp;#39;s guest Dr David Lynch we&amp;#39;re so excited to have him here today Dr Lynch maintains a dynamic program focused on the rare disease friedrick at taxia more specifically the research led by Dr Lynch spans clinical translational and basic science research efforts on fa that include conducting double blind clinical trials identifying biomarkers and leading mechanistic studies in animal and cellular models of fa the research conducted by Dr Lynch and his lab team have led to a greater understanding of the metabolic dysfunction underlying fa their work has led to the creation of a patient database as well as a pipeline of more than 20 drug candidates that represent potential new therapies Dr Lynch is currently working with pharmaceutical industry Partners to develop drug candidates as well as biomarkers for fa we&amp;#39;re so excited to have you here today Dr Lynch Al now turn the time over to you thank you very much Kay I appreciate that lovely introduction as well as a chance for the MDA to speak today so now we&amp;#39;ll go through the hardest part of this is to have me share my screen successfully and let&amp;#39;s see if I can do this here and then go down here to move it into presentation mode and can you see that yet or no no not yet okay have toit the okay toit share and then go down here and H perfect now you see it perfect very good thank you very much uh today I&amp;#39;m going be talking a little bit on the background in freed taxi as well as some of the new developments within the field uh I have a tendency to speak a little bit too fast consequently uh I will do my best to slow down and I know we have a very diverse audience today so hopefully uh we&amp;#39;ll uh I&amp;#39;ll speak it in a way which everyone can understand and if you have questions feel free to answer them at the end of the era or contact me afterward I&amp;#39;m happy to answer them uh by email or anyway later O So now let&amp;#39;s see if I can do this uh okay so taxia let move this window is a rare Progressive n ger disease affecting about one in every 50,000 people in the United States up to one in every 100,000 so about four to 5,000 people in the United States and perhaps 15 to 20,000 people worldwide the presentation always involves neurological dysfunction everyone has neurological troubles however it&amp;#39;s really a multi-stem disease it involves the nervous system the heart Orthopedic issues like scoliosis endocrine issues like bone growth and diabetes audiological features Opthalmic features including vision loss and uh fixation difficulties and finally fatigue fatigue being really a multi-stem symptom in itself so it really is involved in all these different things why doesn&amp;#39;t this one to turn there we are not everyone is the same in freed R taxes backward there&amp;#39;s genotypic and phenotypic heterogenity Chan&amp;#39;s onset is most common usually between the ages of five and 15 although rarely actually as young as five usually about s is the earliest we tend to see people and if you have it presented shelter the progression could be relatively rapid typically involving progression to a wheelchair over the course of 10 to 15 years and by the late teens early 20s most people require assistance for their activities of daily living in contrast later onset fa and it&amp;#39;s really a Continuum people presenting at all ages of life but late onset which is defined as being diagnosed or presenting after age 25 is associated with a slower progression and a milder overall phen time clinical features in the nervous system which is I&amp;#39;m a neurologist I&amp;#39;m going to talk about that more than anything else don&amp;#39;t just happen everywhere this is a very specific set of neurological features what actually goes on there are some particular neurons in the body called the large Sensory neurons which control what we call propri reception knowing where your body is in space that&amp;#39;s obviously very important for balance because if you don&amp;#39;t know where your body is your always going to be off balance you also lose some of the motor pathways the pathways which start up at the top of the brain and project all the way down into the spinal cord to control uh muscle tone and muscle strength this tends to be incomplete people are never completely paralyzed in FA and it tends to be more prominent later in the disease and that&amp;#39;s why you see over the course of time in FA a development of a stiffness and a weakness what people talk about the the most in the central nervous system is loss of that back portion of the brain which I&amp;#39;m trying to Circle here if it&amp;#39;s coming through called the cerebelum the cerebelum is concerned basically with coordination as it gets affected and there are probably two different locations there that get affected you have difficulties with balance not weakness but simply balance Now speech itself has a balance to it so you have speech difficulties and you&amp;#39;ll have limb coordination issues this is the primary thing we think about with freed reex in the nervous system but in fact there are other things including as I mentioned the motor pathways and the sensory nurs you also have a very unusual issue where you have difficulty localizing sound through a very specific portion of the brain step where a person hears and actually usually hears normally but they can&amp;#39;t figure out where the sound is coming from which can in fact be very disabling they&amp;#39;ll be in a large group and they won&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s speaking in a crowded movie theater in a crowded restaurant things could be very uh confusing what is understated in FA as well is the loss of a very specific part of the retina and remember the retina is actually part of the brain it&amp;#39;s the retinal cells that project into the brain that uh provide the visual information of the brain this happens most in people who present early in freed taxia and tends to happen later in the disease as people reach age 30 or so it happens to some degree in everyone but this is an area which is underappreciated and is actually one of the targets of many of some of our clinical trials at this point there&amp;#39;s also a little bit of muscle dysfunction people&amp;#39;s muscle does not degenerate it does not go away but doesn&amp;#39;t work right so people can have some weakness there are overall very few to modest changes in cognition people think normally thus people with fa hold Jobs go to college get married and can do lots and lots of different things because their cognition is not affected people remain smart throughout the course of their free dring taxi and perhaps when you look at this this you see that while there are a lot of very crucial areas of the brain that are affected the overall number of neurons is not that large so MRI scans when you get them clinically early in disease are typically read as normal they may not be quite normal if you really know how to look at them in detail but they&amp;#39;re frequently LED as normal so that&amp;#39;s one of the most important things about fa is there are very key neurons we have to work on but it&amp;#39;s not all of the neurons in the body I mentioned that it is a multi-stem diser uh you have heart issues the one we call cardiomyopathy essentially this is decreased function of the heart it can be stiff it cannot pump but these things can give rise to difficulties uh particularly late in the course of the illness in addition when you have abnormal cardiac tissue give you rise to funny heart rhythms called arhythmia usually these come from the Atria of the heart not the ventricular portion things like atrial fibrillation which you&amp;#39;ll hear about on TV these are uh rhythm which can be managed so it&amp;#39;s important to maintain a relationship with a cardiologist if you&amp;#39;re a person who has those arrhythmias uh endocrine issues are part of Fred taxi about 10 to 20% of people with fa have diabetes a mixture of type one people presenting in childhood and not making enough insulin as well as people presenting later developing typical type two disease usually from insulin resistance so we sometimes refer to it as type 1.5 uh it requires agement of both such issues and it can be well managed in FA we know a fair amount about it in addition people have skeletal abnormalities people have scoliosis particularly those PR in early in life and as uh goes forward about 25% of people have to have corrective surgery almost exclusively those who we meet for the first time before age 10 another thing which is a skeletal I don&amp;#39;t want to call it an abnormality I want to call it an anomaly a variant is called PES cavis high feet that doesn&amp;#39;t usually cause really any disability but is a marker of what&amp;#39;s going on in the brain probably so it&amp;#39;s something that people note do not think of it as a a cause of disability think of the underlying neurological issues as the cause of disability and then fatigue almost everyone feels tired all the time they just can&amp;#39;t get the energy up to do things this is a big effect on people&amp;#39;s quality of life and it&amp;#39;s one of the most important things for us to concentrate on as we move forward in trying to help people out with fre r taxia on September 19th uh 20 23 I had to remember what year it is there is symptomatic treatment for a few issues in FA neuropathic pain being treated by gabab uh Penton spasticity and stiffness being treated by agents such as bphen but more importantly there ongoing clinical trials to really get to the consequences of freed ra taxia and to prevent the downstream to work on the downstream Pathways and the consequences of the original mutation this leads us to the new drug omaveloxolone called Sky cler uh commercially I will refer to asalone or omab because I use generic names which has just been approved we&amp;#39;ll talk a lot more about it later but realize that it&amp;#39;s not a cure and there is ongoing research on more therapies things which actually try and replace the missing protein for taxin so that we get to more Curative aspects rather than temporizing aspects another important part of treatment in FA is just annual evaluation supportive treatment because having free taxia does not protect you from other things we have to be sure we treat those as they come up in order to optimize function so people should be getting it annual echocardiogram and EKG from the uh General practition cardiologist looking at glucose and hemoglobin a1c&amp;#39;s to see if they&amp;#39;re diabetic screening for scoliosis in younger individuals once you get to be your adult high at age 16 to 18 you usually scoliosis uh doesn&amp;#39;t have to be watched as closely vision and hearing screening to optimize people abilities people&amp;#39;s abilities and finally Rehabilitation care is a important part of fa because the more you do the more you do so Physical Therapy occupational therapy and speech therapy are important for keeping people working at their maximum so I do have to do this awful thing called explain a little basic science so what is the genetic basis of freed re taxia most mutations in diseases can be thought of as misspelling and remember this is a recessive disease a person has to have two mutations one on each copy of the gene in order to get disease now in FA the most common mutation 96% of all alals is not a simple misspelling it&amp;#39;s not a simple change in one piece of DNA in one base it&amp;#39;s that a naturally occurring GA repeat which occurs between the first and second exons of the transax Gene goes from short to Long normal numbers are less than 30 ones which cause diseases are 100 to 1500 gaas and we call that the triplet repeat link it&amp;#39;s not a simple misspelling it&amp;#39;s a lengthening of this that gives rise it&amp;#39;s relatively stable from generation to generation but it does it uh it&amp;#39;s the getting longer which happened long ago which causes most of the disease uh uh as it gets long the longer it gets or the longer it is that uh gives rise to uh worsening disease a long GA gives R to more disease and this will explain some of the varability as uh in terms of why uh people have more or less uh uh dysfunction uh and I&amp;#39;ll go to the next slide here some people about 4% of people uh uh and 4% of people they have instead a point mutation a single base change which substitutes for the G repeat length so some people won&amp;#39;t have two J repeats as I look at the genetic test they only have one uh what don&amp;#39;t need to occur is that uh what needs to occur in those that the special type genic testing everyone has at least one GA repeat length except a single person in Turkey who I&amp;#39;m not going to talk about today now this is what I get to that the length of the ga repeat shown here on the x-axis correlates with the age at onset so age and onset is a measure of how severe the disease is you see some people presenting as late as age 40 or 50 and the number of ga8 correlates that longer the ga repeat link the earlier the age of onset thus that can be used as a marker of disease severity in fact the age of onset is a better marker of disease severity in the ga repeat links there are three reasons that people vary a little bit there&amp;#39;s variation between tissues there are other genes that influence the ga repeat length and sometimes the age of onset is it&amp;#39;s looked at retrospectively so it&amp;#39;s not always a really good marker so what are these mutations these expanses in uh the fian gene do what they do is that there&amp;#39;s a protein made from that Gene which is called Toxin and what you can see here taken from my friend Sanjay B chandani is that uh the it it doesn&amp;#39;t make any RNA remember your Gene makes RNA which makes protein essentially that Gene is silent so you don&amp;#39;t make any R RNA if you look on this Western block over here uh I&amp;#39;m trying to get rid of this here you see that the uh for the amount of protein detected here with this dark signal called uh looking at the protein is decreased so people don&amp;#39;t make as much for taxing as a result they P certain difficulties in their cell they don&amp;#39;t make any abnormal for taxi and everyone makes some carriers the parents of people with freed ret taxi make about 50% of normal and they are Stone Cold normal so you really have lose a lot of protetion probably 95% before you&amp;#39;re actually getting diseased people who have the two point mutations Al are almost identical to people with two repeat links so we know that it&amp;#39;s actually the protein that is causing the issues what does fexin do well this is a diagram if you have a biochemistry text and you can see that I copied this from a text because you look on the back of the page here and see that there are certain words on the back if you look very closely is for taxin goes to the mitochondria the place where we all make energy as a result people with freed taxi don&amp;#39;t make enough energy in their cells uh it&amp;#39;s important in uh iron metabolism the mitochondria that&amp;#39;s part of it but the really the way to think about it is the lack of energy production what really happens in freere taxia well people have mutations in their fxn which gives rise to a lack of production of for taxin this leads to trouble making energy in trouble with the uh part of the energy production of their mitochondria and then we wave our hands here there is selective mitochondrial dysfunction that leads to clinical manifestations in including neurological features we don&amp;#39;t know as much about this part and that&amp;#39;s where a lot of the research is ongoing right now uh so why don&amp;#39;t we just make a drug to make more uh energy it&amp;#39;s not quite that easy because even if we make a drug and prove it in scientific and basic science studies we still have to know who to test it in we have to know who&amp;#39;s changing so those are the ideal people we need to know when to try it and we need to know what the potential risks are now these are things which are very hard to do without knowing anything about the population of people with fa and that&amp;#39;s where fortunately the support a variety of groups uh the FDA the freed architex research Alliance and in the early stages of the FDA uh the MDA we&amp;#39;re able to come up with a natural history study where we have been following people for a long period of time uh so before I and before I go to that I want to remind that if you think about free taia there are two concepts behind making new drugs one is to make the mitochondria function better either make them more energy make more energy or to get rid of toxic free radicals or improve the body&amp;#39;s endogenous protection mechanisms or have them make more mitochondria another thing that could be tried uh is to have them make morot taxin turn the gene back on we call this epigenetic we could also increase the amount the gene uh makes by other means by giving a uh putting a new for taxing gene or simply sometimes having people inject for tax and in which has been engineered so it can get into cells in the appropriate Way the final thing we can do and this is what&amp;#39;s being looked at in a few labs around the world but is not yet available for people is actually correct the mutation get rid of GAA repeat so those are various new ideas for treatments so I mentioned that in order to help move this forward we have a large natural history study called facom the free dring taxic clinical outcome measure sometimes called the clinical research Network in free dring taxi we&amp;#39;ve been collecting data for 20 years following up to 1500 people in the United States Canada and Australia this has given us a road map of what freed recet taxi is like associated with it we collect a few other things uh to look for other genes that influence it to look for markers in the blood and in uh cells and in muscle to look at RNA levels which change with the disease we&amp;#39;ve received support from Farah the MDA and the FDA it&amp;#39;s been a very successful study giving rise to a lot of Publications but it really attracts the pharmaceutical companies because we give them a road map of what&amp;#39;s happening in FA and what might be uh so that they can know how to treat people when to treat people and how to measure that change so I know gener for Farmer will be talking on Thursday now about research and she&amp;#39;ll talk a lot about this and how to participate we&amp;#39;ve actually now used this study with an analogous study from Europe in a study uh which we call unify which will be what it is going forward one of the things we&amp;#39;ve been able to figure out we&amp;#39;ve been able to precise cover really precisely how long we expect people to go before uh needing a wheelchair we can use that as an index of how they&amp;#39;re doing and in the early onset people that&amp;#39;s the group here in the blue the later middle onset is in the lighter blue and the lightest blue is the later onset it was 16.4 year years is one of the things we were able to determine we&amp;#39;ve also determined some things about clinical treatment based on what we&amp;#39;ve learned from the natural history study one thing we learned people with fre taxi are smaller than average uh they&amp;#39;re the 42nd percentile of the general population uh uh so in fact we know that people uh uh this smallness or loss of size is mainly in height somewhat in BMI once you get to puber we know this increases so people actually catch up that&amp;#39;s partly because older individuals have shorter repeats uh so if they&amp;#39;re slightly different group older people tend to be less active so they gain a little weight and the other thing is that all of us me included gain weight as we go through time uh this is a normal thing which actually protects us as we age uh so we know that people actually catch up uh over time uh in weight the lower BMI uh does reflect uh it does parallel neurological dysfunction people who are smaller tend to have worse neurological function but it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the smallness gives rise to change of neurological function it&amp;#39;s probably one shared event which is caused both of them so just feeding more Force feeding isn&amp;#39;t going to help people eat what they need to eat there probably is an ideal fa diet out there we&amp;#39;re just not smart enough yet to know what it is although I think we&amp;#39;re making real strides on that another thing we have learned from the group is that in FA people discovered that if when you lack fraxin iron accumulates in the mitochondria some people thought that this was a good idea to avoid iron and if you take away the iron it actually improves the card staus to some degree but what we&amp;#39;ve learned from the Natural History studies and people are actually anemic people actually depleted of iron in part of their cells so in fact one of the important things is to be able to treat the anemia when it occurs and don&amp;#39;t be scared about over accumulating iron I didn&amp;#39;t say go out and take iron just for the sake of doing it but we haven&amp;#39;t found those Adverse Events that we&amp;#39;re worried about and in fact iron is an okay thing in freed taxia it may not work long time because in fact people are just going spit it right back out but uh it&amp;#39;s uh something which is not as worrisome as we thought so these are things we&amp;#39;ve learned clinically from the natural history study in addition to Bringing forward research there&amp;#39;s some new considerations that we&amp;#39;ve learned now as we&amp;#39;re developing new treatment should we treat people earlier well ideally once we have a medicine uh we should do that so there&amp;#39;s some things to particularly talk about I think many people know that it takes a while to be diagnosed could we shorten that diag agnostic journey and we could we uh carry out predictive testing to find out people earlier so this is from a study that sharah did a couple years ago and what they looked at is what the initial symptom was and what where should we be looking for people with fa not surprisingly in almost all age groups less than 10 10 to 19 and older than 20 uh if they tax you in the less than 10 group there are a few people who present with heart disease a lot of people who present with other and a few people present with scoliosis as you go to teage years heart disease gets less and scoliosis be becomes a thing which is monitored and when you get to adults it&amp;#39;s almost all a taum because the other parts are not as of the disease are not as prominent in later on said individuals another interesting thing is how long it actually takes people to get diagnosed so the blue here is the people who presented later older than 20 the red group is the people presented under age 10 and the 49% is the major group between ages 10 to 19 what you see is that the uh group who res youngest actually have the shortest time to being diagnosed and the people resent lates have the longest time so what that would appear to be telling us is what&amp;#39;s really identifies people for positions to each other that a person has a disease is how fast you&amp;#39;re changing how fast is your balance getting worse not the actual status that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s hardest in adults and in some ways easiest in children it&amp;#39;s 2.3 years a good amount of time I think it&amp;#39;s a little long it&amp;#39;s a little hard sometimes because there are clumsy people in the world and pediatric the whole concept is you don&amp;#39;t make diagnosis if you don&amp;#39;t need to we need probably as the uh treatment come forward to put more pressure onto identifying people earlier one in fact the other interesting thing is that 30% of were actually misdiagnosed of their first medical diagnosis most it&amp;#39;s more common in the younger individuals the most common thing they&amp;#39;re diagnosed with a Shar andry tooth inherited neuropathy sometimes cerebral poy in the adults I&amp;#39;ll mentions multiple sclerosis that they&amp;#39;re usually diagnosed with because that&amp;#39;s the thing which looks closely to so there is a lot of room for improvement in the early uh features of the disease uh another question is Siblings when we see two people in the same family uh they show up at the same age 55 people at chop most of the people presented very similar in age only 10 of those sibling uh presented five or more years apart and 15 were three to four years apart 30 within two years so when siblings show up they usually show up at the same age so that means there&amp;#39;s a time when you can be pretty sure that a person who hasn&amp;#39;t been genetically tested doesn&amp;#39;t have fa but it&amp;#39;s hard to be 100% certain if they&amp;#39;ve gotten over a certain age age one of the things what you can do now genetically is you can test people before they have symptoms this is a ethical discussion that has lots of landmines in it but one of the key aspects is is freed Rec taxia treatable if it&amp;#39;s untreatable the question becomes why because you&amp;#39;re going to change your life forever if you&amp;#39;re tested in or positive and whether that&amp;#39;s a good thing is not not certain but is it untreatable what constitute treatment many people take the vitamin co-enzyme q that probably is slightly beneficial is that a treatment can we find people earlier with heart disease and thus prevent them from having complications is that a treatment that&amp;#39;s an interesting question is there uh a uh is there also a nutritional therapy that we can use is there an off label treatment something which is available from another disease they would uh might help fa does that mean we should go testing people early and finally that gets us to the question of omoone which is approved for people 16 and older but it&amp;#39;s not yet a treatment for people under the age of 16 is that a reason to do predictive testing well perhaps the possibility that there will be an omoone trial in children to try and get the drug into that age group is that a reason to uh go there I would say potentially so but I tell everyone in the audience be careful where you go because once you go down the genetic testing you can&amp;#39;t go back I was given this story about a year and a half ago now a 14-month-old evaluated for developmental delay and in the end I don&amp;#39;t even think they had developmental delay all the usual things were negative the simple things uh treal items so they went to a test called hm sequencing which now can sometimes pick up the freed taxi repeats and they actually found that this this 14-month-old had free Dr taxia they confirmed it by direct testing and he got the privilege of going to see some cardiologist get some spine films done in 18 months got started on coenzyme Q the only problem the second repeat length was so short that that person is predicted to show up at a neurologist at age 40 so have we done a good thing here that&amp;#39;s an interesting question I&amp;#39;m not going to take a POS position but I would like people to think before they go into the predictive testing World which brings us to why do we talk about uh predictive testing omoone om after short this is a small organic molecule from R pharmaceutical it&amp;#39;s basically safe there have been lots of phase one studies done in normal individuals and a couple other diseases and it does not have a lot of side effects uh I will mention since it&amp;#39;s released recently that&amp;#39;s basically true uh it appears that continues to be true what it does is it keeps a certain protein called nf2 around Nrf2 controls the body&amp;#39;s response mitochondrial disease it makes you do better if you have a mitochondri disease for some reason this is turned off in fredra taxia as a result you could theoretically give omav and people would uh deal with their freed Dr taxia better they&amp;#39; restore some of the missing processes and they should get better perhaps and perhaps stabilized I mentioned this slide here I mentioned there was very little data in animals before they decided to give it to people because it was a safe drug and other diseases so if you look for a lot of studies does it do anything in mice you will find that there is no answer because it was never done it works in some of the cells and a dish which people gave us for the natural history study and is safe that&amp;#39;s what brought it forward so uh it went forward with in some ways a simpler approach we see other drugs uh do don&amp;#39;t you can ask me at the end how long it took and I&amp;#39;ll tell you a little bit more about it the pivotal study and this is the way we prove drugs work a double blind Placebo controlled worldwide randomized trial 100 people uh 40 actually uh really 80 people 40 people on drug 40 people on Placebo people had a score where I mentioned here 20 to 80 on their exam that someone early in the disease to someone late in the disease everyone was between ages 16 to 40 because that&amp;#39;s where safety data was available half the people that means randomized one to one get drug half get Placebo for 48 weeks essentially one year we look only at people who don&amp;#39;t have arch feet uh we can talk about that later if you like the primary endpoint what we use to prove it works is what is their exam score look like did they do better worse or the same not complicated this is the data this graph shows on the excess study week this is overtime white is the placebo group this light blue is the drug group down is good we started at Baseline of zero people get better over the first 12 weeks the placebo group gets a little better that&amp;#39;s what happens in uh all studies drug group gets better and stays better so the maximum benefit is out nine to 9 to 12 months thus this is people on drug do better at essentially one year how much is this differ between the placebo group and the people on drug this difference between the group is about 2.5 points what is that that&amp;#39;s the amount a person would be expected to progress over the course of about two years she could say that people got about one and a half years better from where they started and they&amp;#39;re about two to two and a half points better they would have been the pr on that was statistically significant it worked basically uh does it last yes it does so here we did a different experiment where we actually compared the after that 48 week Point everyone gets drug that&amp;#39;s one of the enticements to bring people and to get more safety data everyone goes on drug this group group in the blue are the people in the study and this starts at the 48 week moment this gets rid of the Improvement of the first year you look at it people on drug progress a little bit people who were matched to those indiv visual study from our who came from our natural history study worsen uh about 60% more so people on drug did better again throughout through three years this difference here at three years is bigger than the difference at two years which is bigger than difference at one year and they started at the same spot thus at year three which is four years total people on omav are still getting better than untreated individual When comparing to Natural History data this was actually the Tipping Point of data which brought the FDA over to approval so this comes directly from our natural history study so as you hear about these studies that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s worth participating because it does lead to development of therapies uh so the last day the FDA could decide was on the 28th of February of this year here they let the announcement out at 4:35 in the afternoon uh I think I was writing my exercise bike of the time it&amp;#39;s a moment I won&amp;#39;t forget uh it was approved for all as beneficial therapy for all fa patients in the United States who are age 16 or older that&amp;#39;s actually a broader approvement uh approval than in the study it&amp;#39;s broader in that it included everyone above the age of 40 they saw no need to differentiate there because the rationale had worked in people of that age would contined to work in such individuals uh there were very few Adverse Events that&amp;#39;s part of the reason it gets approved the data is good the data is aren&amp;#39;t very good in many individuals but the fact that it&amp;#39;s basically safe helps get you to Across the finish line there&amp;#39;s the concept of regulatory flexibility you don&amp;#39;t have to be perfect in degenerative disease you have to be good enough and this was deemed good enough now there is one thing which I glossed over a little bit is that the dosing is very specific one of the unusual things about omav is if you cut the dose in half you get rid of about half the benefit you still see benefit but it&amp;#39;s only half as much if you double the dose the benefit goes away so that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s very important to be on the right dose if my good friends at Riata had not done a very detailed dosing SP study in FA that I did not show you we would have missed the correct dose what does that mean it means you have to be safe moving forward and there are various other drugs that influence the what the dose of omav should be for example uh pack slov the coid drug makes you have to cut your dose in half for at least the time you&amp;#39;re on it so these are some of the complicated issues about it but they&amp;#39;re very manageable at this point it&amp;#39;s not available in other countries uh presentations being made to other countries at this point to help it get approved there I think I we would anticipating the tangible future in other countries will be Evol approved but it&amp;#39;s not available yet it is not approved for children uh now it is priced at roughly $370,000 per year so it&amp;#39;s not likely that uh your doctors or your insurance company will approve of using so-called off label without it directly being approved for children uh there that&amp;#39;s sort of a financial political aspect but there are reasons not to do that its safety is unknown uh do I think it&amp;#39;s unsafe in children no but we simply don&amp;#39;t know and you may find things that as you go younger that you have not seen before but I think the biggest issue is the dosing is nknown uh they have not systematically assess the dose to look at how fast it turns over uh and as a result a person who&amp;#39;s taking the adult dose may be above or below what they need to take thus I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s I think in many individuals it will not be effective unless we do the required dosing study I would speculate that that is in the planning and I know we&amp;#39;ll have lots of participants wanting to go forward as soon as uh we&amp;#39;re able to get that event planned the drug omav wasn&amp;#39;t available for about four months after its approval due to the impurity in the original uh commercial batches it is now physically available uh we are getting it approved by insurance companies uh there&amp;#39;s a patient assistance program in place if a person&amp;#39;s co-pay is too high so I would have everyone ask their neurologist about it because of this effect that it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s the benefit is very ulent it is very hard to know right away that it is beneficial it&amp;#39;s not like you snap your fingers and you&amp;#39;re better it builds up on you you look back in time and notice hey I&amp;#39;m doing things better so you won&amp;#39;t immediately know if it&amp;#39;s beneficial but given that it&amp;#39;s safe you have to think of the question from the opposite way is there reason I shouldn&amp;#39;t be taking it Adverse Events Financial impropriety or if you&amp;#39;re really intolerant or if you go a couple years on it and you see no change from your pevious progression then you may be one of those uh few individuals who don&amp;#39;t respond to it such individuals do exist as they go for all drugs so give consideration to getting on it and talk about it with your neurologist and if they don&amp;#39;t understand the dosing your neurologists are happy to contact me so what were our conclusions right now well uh we finally have that available treatment but this is not the end this is the first step we need to start looking at other agents that give fxing to people that put the FX and Gene back in that correct the mutation or that turn the gene back on like a dimmer switch these are the things that we need to work on now and there are companies developing these and even some reaching clinical trials this point we also need to extend omab to children but we have to do the studies that uh are required for that I would ask everyone to look for those studies and consider participating if you are eligible and then we need to think about these new treatments and how it affects approaches to other as aspects of Life how one lives lives but also particularly the aspect of predictive testing and the value in earlier diagnosis and decide whether that&amp;#39;s something which is necessary or not that&amp;#39;s something that everyone can think about in the unique uness of their own life because not everyone will have the same answer to those questions so with that aside I want to emphasize the most important thing which is uh that we didn&amp;#39;t get here by one person doing group I list here only the people of my lab group uh who have gotten together to help make things go but I&amp;#39;ve had lots of collaborators through the year from people from pen chop Sanjay from Oklahoma uh Bill Gates spelled a different way from Mr I skin sh for Farmer from Fair the nap reles who are now uh who used to be at UAB and they&amp;#39;re now in Dallas Riata Pharmaceuticals the sponsor our study so we&amp;#39;ve had lots of funding agencies and that&amp;#39;s how we got here and this picture epitomizes the collaboration that is necessary to move forward uh this is one of my uh favorite patients she&amp;#39;s now a senior in college oh my gosh I&amp;#39;m old uh this was when she was much younger at a social event with this is the daughter of another famous fa researcher I won&amp;#39;t mention it and this is of course for those people who know my daughter so and they are all friends and all get together all the time whenever they have a chance to be in Philadelphia so I&amp;#39;m going to stop there to give you a chance to ask a lot of question because I suspect there are some on om and I want to thank you again for giving me a chance to talk all right let&amp;#39;s see let me get my screen shared so we can open up for some questions okay and I&amp;#39;m very good there you go so thank you so much for that wonderful presentation Dr Lynch um we can now open the webinar to questions um for anybody in the audience may have you can send your questions and using the chat feature um while we wait to see if any come in we did actually get a few beforehand and you did address some of these but um just in case we&amp;#39;ll go over it again um somebody asked as a parent of a 10-year-old with fa what is the expected timeline for pediatric trials what can we in the community do to help the process uh very good question uh so the things one can so they&amp;#39;re having pediatric studies in FA and we are trying to move everything to that uh PTC 743 just completed a pediatric study unfortunately it did not have enough benefit to reach its end point they&amp;#39;re discussing with the FDA whether there&amp;#39;s a path forward uh it again is a safe drug but the benefit would on its primary outcome measure was not there so we&amp;#39;ll see where the ruling comes uh the things one can do so let&amp;#39;s suppose that uh I I will tell you the dose of omab for example when a child is not published uh how do you know where to start well to figure that out they&amp;#39;re going to have to start with a study where they give it to people for a very small amount for a very uh short time uh so you might see a study announced where to get one dose of drug now one dose of drug isn&amp;#39;t going to provide any benefit uh but it&amp;#39;s a necessary precursor to doing the study where you wi people will get benefit and benefit will get proven now the extension of a drug from The Adult World to the Pediatric World sometimes requires another clinical trial where they show its uh proof again sometimes it&amp;#39;s it doesn&amp;#39;t most epilepsy drugs right now they be approved in adults and then the mechanisms of epilepsy seizures are so common they&amp;#39;re so similar between uh older children and young adults that all the company will be asked for some safety data and some dosing data and not have to do efficacy studies we don&amp;#39;t know where this is going to go with uh omoone but that would be a faster path forward so if you see a respon a clinical trial consider whether you want to participate in it and if you do most of the trials recruit by an email from Farah from their registry where be signed up on the registry get that email the fastest response to one of those announcements we sent out and the email will come out hi a trial is being carried out at these institutions call the institution if you want to participate uh you&amp;#39;ll get that email the fact fastest response we&amp;#39;ve ever had was 28 seconds we have a good problem in freed ra taxi we were once asked to fill a study of 30 ambulatory children which you would think there would be hard we had 52 and two hours so respond right away and also consider what it&amp;#39;s going to take to be in a trial they have different amount numbers of visits and Jennifer will Jennifer arm will go through this all probably on Thursday day if they have different numbers of visits see that you know you can commit to be there because one of the issues which sometimes comes up is people finding out they can&amp;#39;t really do it and I&amp;#39;ll say that some of the data from omav was compromised by an external Force making the study hard coid which made the visits a lot different instructure made it hard for people to travel so think about those things but participate in the studies as you&amp;#39;re as they&amp;#39;re announced realize that just because something isn&amp;#39;t a clinical trial doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it doesn&amp;#39;t move the needle forward there are other studies that we need to do in order to look for markers and early stage disease and things which when the FDA looks at a drug it&amp;#39;s not only that primary outcome that thing which we judge to be better or worse it&amp;#39;s the whole package it&amp;#39;s the safety it&amp;#39;s the biomarkers it&amp;#39;s the things we call secondary outcomes so studies of those things are just as important so right now the only trial that I know recruiting for uh 10year olds is Dr McCormack&amp;#39;s study of nicotinamide riboside at the Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia this is a So-Cal 2 by two study it has nicotinamide riboside as an intervention and a different intervention exercise you get randomized either receiving drug or not and exercise or not if you get randomized exercise they send you home with a recumbent exercise bike if you get randomized what I like to call the couch potato arm you get an exercise bike at the end of the study one of my patient said you should get a couch but that&amp;#39;s not in their protocol so it&amp;#39;s a good study this would be something that they&amp;#39;re looking to add on top of omap to make things a little bit more better if that&amp;#39;s an appropriate grammatical phrase I think many of you know Kyle o&amp;#39; Bryant who has spent his life demonstrated that exercise can help treat fa so that&amp;#39;s my speech on Char for young individuals thank you 64 and L just for the record gotcha thank you you um so we have had some questions come into the chat now so somebody has asked so if you see Improvement did you say you might continue to see Improvement for up to two years so there are some people in this study whose exams are the same as they were five years ago or even a little better because they had that first year of improvement what you see from the graph is an average response where some people are continuing to improve uh out to the two-year Point uh I&amp;#39;m not going to say that I remember anyone who improved beyond the two-year Point some people are starting to progress everyone is a little different there are some individuals who claim no benefit and our exams didn&amp;#39;t necessarily show benefit of those individuals one individual the people he work with said his speech got better another individual he elected to go off medicine and then he got worse which means he was probably working for him and he didn&amp;#39;t know it because again the benefit is indolent at om and there is one person who elected to go off drug and didn&amp;#39;t get any worse so I&amp;#39;m convinced that he was not being benefited by it whether we like it or not we&amp;#39;re all different and we all have different amounts of response absolutely thank you um somebody has asked um if when the drug is available um is do you know if it would be available for people who don&amp;#39;t have insurance or if they&amp;#39;re on social security or advice on that so the best way to figure this out is to apply so it&amp;#39;s it is available now you should have you should get the prescription and then it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a mail order only drug so we work with a program set up called the r of reach program where they contact the insurance and then we discuss things with your insurance company if you have no insurance there&amp;#39;s a patient assistance program that can take the cost down how low I will let my friends at Riata reach which is the uh patient assistance program tell you it can go to a low number if the co-pay is too high there are ways uh to try and get it down I will not make statements on how much for any given individual but you don&amp;#39;t know unless you ask and somebody actually did ask in the chat how much this would cost again so that&amp;#39;s something that each individual would need to reach out and each one individual would need to know I know online people talk about how they haven&amp;#39;t been able to get it we just reviewed this today we have gotten greater than 80% of our people covered by insurance with co-pays which are $75 or less per month there are some people whose nominal co-pay was $7,000 a month then the patient assistance program has taken care of that in that person that I&amp;#39;m thinking of we also have people whose insurance has a co-pay of zero doar there are two places where push back has become common because the study included fewer ambulatory non- amatory individuals uh there&amp;#39;s push back on that because people who have higher speet didn&amp;#39;t have as much response or been pushed back on that we have successfully gotten it approved for individuals with both of those issues so nothing is absolute you make the argument and you go from there and I&amp;#39;m getting better and better at arguing as I get older and older some of us have been good at it for a very long time so all right let&amp;#39;s see somebody has asked does the GAA repeat number change or get higher with progression so your uh very good question uh when we talk about it expanding it expands as it goes through uh germ cell differentiation uh and it&amp;#39;s even a little bit more complicated than that once a person has it we do not believe it substantially expands it we&amp;#39;ve been able to measure this in conjunction with mer and the projection is it gets 10 repeats worse over the course of a decade so when you talk about a significant number being 100 to, 1500 it&amp;#39;s not changing over the course of a person&amp;#39;s life progression comes so progression comes you and we don&amp;#39;t believe for taxin levels change over the course of a lifetime they stay the same but what it is is that low number wears and wears on your tissue so that things keep getting worse and worse and more and more cells drop out over time more and more processes are dysfunctional so it&amp;#39;s the cumulative event which gives rise to it not a change in the molecular events thata thank you um let&amp;#39;s see somebody&amp;#39;s ask if a person is on Sky Claris would you discontinue use for future trials so the only reason you ethically should have to go off Sky Claris in another trial is if it has a drug interaction with whatever the medicine is being tested uh drug interactions it occurs calcium channel blockers a couple anti-depressants uh some antibiotics antifungal agents uh impacts loid as well as CBD St John&amp;#39;s work and grapefruit juice so you&amp;#39;re not allowed to drink grapefruit juice on omf if th if those were one of the conditions you&amp;#39;d have to go off of Sky Claris but that&amp;#39;s or you&amp;#39;d have to go off Gra uh the only other reason is if Sky Claris did the same thing as the drug which was being tested almost everything in Trials now is something which raises for taxin levels there is no published data that says uh uh omav raises for tax and levels so in my opinion it would be unethical to design a study where people had to go off OM they could ask you to stay on during the course of a trial so it&amp;#39;s not a confounder but they it would be hard to ask you to go off of it okay um does having a lower repeat number tend to make the drug seem to work better uh good question the answer is there was a slight if you look at the data published there is a slightly increased benefit for people who have long GA repeat links but it was not statistic significant that they were different it was just and it was we didn&amp;#39;t account for all the other variables the people with long J repeat links tend to be younger so maybe as younger people responded better or maybe it was the people who had long G repeats were seen in a different phase of the moon we didn&amp;#39;t separate all those things out so you can&amp;#39;t really say it there were people in this study from repeat links in the 200s to repeat links in the 900s okay um one of the questions that we got actually beforehand when somebody registered was um do you have more clarification as to why liver enzymes May Elevate I&amp;#39;ve read that as a sign that the drug is working oh you&amp;#39;ve read the the detail so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not that liver enzymes go up it&amp;#39;s that all these enzyme called transaminases go up in every tissue in the body it&amp;#39;s just that they mainly come from the liver when we check them in the blood the liver itself is is not impacted in a negative manner it still makes all the proteins it should it still gets rid of blood cells with the process of making Billy Rubin it&amp;#39;s just that the enzymes go up because you&amp;#39;re metabolically turning the body back on remember how I said people with fa are small their metabolism is low inherently we are metabolically turning them back on so it goes up it&amp;#39;s a Tim limed process it goes uh for one to two months and goes away uh I this is not liver toxicity it&amp;#39;s liver enzymes going up and while everyone sits on the edge of their chair worrying that about the first person who gets true liver toxicity not because that&amp;#39;s ever happened but because you always have to worry about things because things happen I will expect that we will see new Adverse Events we didn&amp;#39;t see in the study why because we&amp;#39;re giving it to 10 times as many people but so you did pick up the other thing that there&amp;#39;s a small tendency and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s ever published that the that liver enzymes as a marker of metabolism predict people who may respond better that&amp;#39;s a very small tendency and I don&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t officially know where you obtain that true fact from but uh so it is a predictor that you can respond to the drug now it&amp;#39;s not a perfect correlation so don&amp;#39;t think because your liver enzymes went to 11 times normal you&amp;#39;re going to see 11 times the benefit uh so but you are correct all right um I think we have time I saw one more question come in um somebody in the chat has asked non-ambulatory person will or will not see any benefit from the drug in the study people who were non-ambulatory actually had a higher average benefit than those who are ambulatory so they will see benefit on average but it won&amp;#39;t be necessarily the same benefit because think of it as going back a year and a half in time on your neurologic exam where if you start from a different point you&amp;#39;ll be doing different things think about it is taking on the things that are not yet irreversibly affected so what you what the recovery you see may be different in character and everyone&amp;#39;s different everyone&amp;#39;s different that seems to be one of the key things in all of this is everybody&amp;#39;s different and everybody will respond differently that is correct um oh goodness we did have a few more questions to just come in let&amp;#39;s see if we can get someone um somebody has asked what is the process of getting this drug um do I start the process or does the doctor um can you just talk a little bit about that what you should do is you should talk to your doctor it can be your neurologist it could be your primary practitioner it could be anyone who&amp;#39;s willing to do it and say hi there&amp;#39;s a new drug for fre taxia uh this is uh what you need to do to get me on it and there&amp;#39;s uh you can just look up Sky Claris online and it&amp;#39;ll take you to the website where you can download a form and send that off to the centralized Pharmacy uh and then go from there if there are Physicians who don&amp;#39;t understand about it uh I&amp;#39;m happy to talk to them by email or phone if there are people who uh I&amp;#39;ve had a couple doctors who were not comfortable prescribing until a person come to see me I&amp;#39;m happy to see anyone uh so uh or I&amp;#39;m happy to talk to your doctor whatever you like perfect um it looks like the last question that came in somebody had asked um they said that their cholesterol has been going up every month and they take the medicine before blood work but they&amp;#39;re asking should I not take it until after the blood work so the cholesterol thing cholesterol does go up remember high cholesterol is actually a subtle part of fa that we don&amp;#39;t talk about is a little bit higher and remember that there&amp;#39;s at least one person on this webinar who takes medications for uh high cholesterol and it&amp;#39;s not Kayla uh so what I would you don&amp;#39;t care about whether it&amp;#39;s before after blood work it&amp;#39;s going up long term it&amp;#39;s not being it&amp;#39;s not going to matter before or after the medicine and in fact I hate to break something your doctors have told you you don&amp;#39;t need to fast to get an accurate cholesterol number uh that only affects triglyceride so you can get your cholesterol anytime what you care about cholesterol for is not what it is today not what it is tomorrow but what it continuously is and whether it puts you at risk for vascular disease which is a big part of being an American let us say uh uh so if your cholesterol goes up then there are various ways to treat that including low cholesterol diet increased exercise uh statins and then there even non-statin cholesterol lowering edges uh out there so that would be something to talk about with your doctor if your cholesterol reached the the trigger numbers which keep getting lower because they keep wanting our cholesterol lower all right um so we we have run out of time um Dr Lynch we are so glad you&amp;#39;re here with us tonight um we sincerely appreciate your time your expertise and everything you do for the the neuromuscular Community we so appreciate you being here with us great thank you I I would also like to again thank our webinar supporter Riata Pharmaceuticals we would not be able to provide Community Education webinars like this if not for their gner

General Medical information and does not replace the medical advice of your doctor or healthc care provider if you have questions pertaining to your medical condition ask your doctor or healthcare provider freed r a taxi introduction fredita taxia is a disease that damages your nervous system it affects your spinal cord and the nerves that control muscle movement in your arms and legs the main symptom is a taxia Axia means trouble controlling movements the symptoms of fa can be treated with medicines braces surgery and physical therapy this program explains freed rot taxia it covers symptoms and causes of the disease it also talks about diagnosis and treatment the nervous system together the brain and spinal cord are called the central nervous system the nerves in the rest of the body are called the peripheral nervous system the brain is the command center of the body it lets us think and feel it also receives information and sends orders to different parts of the body orders from the brain travel through the spinal cord from the spinal cord orders travel to the rest of the body through peripheral nerves healthy nerves send and receive messages about movement for example if you want to raise your hand your brain tells your arm in hand to do it healthy nerves also send and receive messages about sensation or feeling if you burn your hand while cooking the nerves in the skin send pain signals to your brain if nerves become damaged they cannot send and receive messages well this can cause problems with movement and sensation nerve damage can happen anywhere in the body important organs can also be affected by nerve problems freed taxia freed reita taxia is also called fa or FDA it is a rare inherited disease this means it has passed from parents to child it causes nervous system damage and movement problems fa usually begins in childhood it leads to impaired muscle coordination that gets worse over time in FA the spinal cord and peripheral nerves become thinner the cerebellum is also affected the cerebellum is the part of the brain that helps control balance and movement damage to the nerves and brain causes awkward unsteady movements it also causes problems with with Sensations in some cases fa causes problems in the heart and spine some people with the condition May develop diabetes fa does not affect thinking and reasoning abilities sponsored by the patient Education Institute www.patient.com over 5,000 videos and interactive tutorials symptoms symptoms of fa usually begin between the ages of 5 and 15 the main symptom is a taxia which means trouble controlling movements other symptoms of fa include difficulty walking involuntary eye movements muscle weakness scoliosis which is curving of the spine to one side speech problems fa can also affect the heart resulting in chest pain heart palpitations shortness of breath most individuals with fa get tired easily they may also find that they take a longer time to recover from common illnesses like colds and the flu people with fa usually need a wheelchair 10 to 20 years after symptoms first appear but many people with the disease can live normal lives in severe cases of fa people become incapacitated they can no longer care for themselves and must rely on others for daily living causes fa is inherited this means it is passed on from parent to child it is caused by a defective or abnormal Gene fa is not contagious you cannot catch it from another person genes tell the body to make certain substances every person has thousands of genes our genes make us look the way we do they also have a lot to do with our health fa is caused by a mutation or change in a gene labeled fxn the fxn gene controls the production of a protein called fraxin fraxin is found in the parts of the cell that make energy if the body does not have enough protexin it cannot make energy this can lead to oxidative stress oxidative stress is when there is a buildup of harm toxins and free radicals in the cells free radicals can destroy cells and can harm the body certain cells are affected by the lack of fraxin these include cells in the brain heart muscle peripheral nerve spinal cord damage to these cells results in the symptoms of fa fa only happens in someone who inherits two defective copies of the gene one from each parent a person who has only one abnormal copy of the gene is called a carrier a carrier will not develop fa but he or she can pass the gene mutation on to his or her children if both parents are carriers their children will have a one and four chance of having the disease their children will also have a one and two chance of inheriting one abnormal Gene and being carriers diagnosis a health care provider will first ask about your child&amp;#39;s medical history in symptoms he or she will also ask about family medical history a physical exam will be performed the healthc care provider will check for balance problems lack of reflexes loss of sensation in the joints signs of neurological problems a genetic blood test is used to diagnose fa it shows if your child has two defective fxn genes other tests may also be done to check for damage caused by fa these include CT scan echocardiogram electrocardiogram or ECG electromyogram or EMG MRI nerve conduction studies treatment there is no cure for fa treat treatment focuses on relieving symptoms of the disease treatment may include medicines braces surgery physical therapy speech therapy assistive devices medicines can be used to treat diabetes or heart problems caused by fa foot deformities and scoliosis can be corrected with braces or surgery physical therapy May prolong use of the arms and legs speech therapists can help retrain muscles in the face and neck this can improve speech and swallowing a syy of devices such as a wheelchair or Walker can help a person with fa get around other devices can help with daily activities if you like this video please like and share for similar

    "transcript": "welcome to the freedrakes ataxia research update i&amp;#39;m julie greenfield and i&amp;#39;m the head of research at the texan uk talk a little bit about tax uk and the activities we do to promote research i&amp;#39;ll then talk about developments in new treatments followed by some developments in symptomatic relief treatments and lastly talk about some opportunities for you to take part in research so what does a taxi uk do to promote research we have a research strategy that says that we aim to maximize the impact of research in improving diagnosis and developing treatments that are available to patients and we do this by funding a wide range of research projects in laboratories around the world and we work as the link between researchers and the ataxia community we&amp;#39;re very pleased in our latest impact report that we found that for every pound that taxi uk invested it generated four pounds in further ataxia research so we were delighted with that figure we work very much in collaboration with researchers with pharma companies with other charities and at the center of everything we do we always have people with a taxi and we engage and work closely with people with ataxia to try and get their involvement in the research process we also organize conferences and workshops so our large big largest international event that we organized was in november 2019 when we organized the international ataxia research conference together with our collaborators other charities and we&amp;#39;re now planning the next one for 2022 in collaboration again so talk free drugs ataxia the aim in fa research we know that we have a mistake in the frataxin gene which causes the freedox ataxia that leads to a reduction in the frataxin protein and that leads to a number of disruption and processes within the cells such as oxidative stress you get an increase in iron in the mitochondria which are the parts of the cell which are responsible for producing energy for the cell and you get cell damage and by knowing all this pathway we know where to intervene so you can intervene by gene therapy by increasing the reading of the frataxin gene you can intervene by increasing the amount of the frataxin protein by a number of different ways and you can also intervene by targeting the disruption of these various cellular processes and all these types of therapies are being developed around the world approaches and targeting specifically the root of the problem the mistake in the fratex so you can use gene therapy nfa and gene therapy means when you&amp;#39;re replacing or repairing the gene that causes the condition we know that there are a number of companies around the world who are in early stages of developing gene therapy for free drugs ataxia and you can see on the slide a number of these companies listed and their approach is to use a virus as a vehicle to deliver a functional version of the frataxin gene to the central nervous system to the brain and they&amp;#39;re all currently in pre-clinical development meaning they&amp;#39;re not actually trialing in people with free director taxi just yet and there are also a number of academic groups around the world working and developing gene therapy approaches in free drugs ataxia one such group is in spain and attacks the uk is funding a project there in developing a way in which to correct the fa gene to be delivered to the central nervous system using a viral transporter and the team are they&amp;#39;re currently studying how this virus distributes in the body using animal models of fluorex ataxia so the good news is that there are gene therapy treatments that have been approved in other conditions so one example from 2019 was that gene therapy was approved for the spinal muscular atrophy which is another rare neurological condition and it is now actually available on the nhs similarly another kind of gene silencing treatment was approved by regulators in europe the ema to treat a form of hereditary myelodiosis and so this is really promising because we&amp;#39;re actually getting gene therapy approaches being made into treatments available for patients so we&amp;#39;re really hoping that similar things can happen for free drugs ataxia in the future now moving on to developments and treatments where you&amp;#39;re trying to increase the frataxin protein we&amp;#39;ve spoken about the gene therapy approaches up till now now let&amp;#39;s look at your developments in increasing frataxin protein so there are a number of drug treatments to increase the frataxin protein and a number of pre-clinical studies are being carried out to identify drugs that can actually increase the levels of frataxin protein and i&amp;#39;ll give a few examples here one example is an existing drug called interferon gamma that was shown to increase protection in a number of different cell types and a mouse model of free drugs another example is dimethyl fumarate which is a drug used in multiple sclerosis which also is found to increase frataxin in cell and mouse models and indeed in people with ms they found that taking the drug their levels of frataxin increased there are other approaches so attacks the uk for example is just funding a team in france to test large number of chemical compounds and try and identify those which could function in the place of frataxin so a kind of replacement of the frataxin function and also those drugs that could enhance the activity of frataxin so these are other approaches to try and find drugs that could then eventually be tested in human trials and moving on trials there are a number of drugs that are at the clinical trial stage being tested in people with free drugs ataxia around the world and the first one i wasn&amp;#39;t wanted to talk to you about is the frataxin replacement therapy so a company called larimar therapeutics are currently investigating a drug which is in phase one clinical trial and they&amp;#39;re expecting results in 2021 and this drug helps to deliver frataxin to the mitochondria which is where the frotaxin is found within the cells and this particular drug has been granted rare pediatric disease designation means meaning it could be fast tracked so if the child is positive the the treatment could be fast tracked in development a treatment for the condition another example of a drug that is in the clinical trial stage and it increases for toxin levels is exenatide an exenatide is a drug that was developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and it was shown to increase frataxin in mouse models and in cells of people with faith and then a small clinical trial took place in belgium with 16 participants and they found that in five weeks this exedate treatment increased the frataxin expression within the cells of people left this was a very small study and it wasn&amp;#39;t looking at the efficacy in improving the ataxia so larger studies are needed to see whether it actually improves symptoms of fa is in traverine now a traverin is an antiviral drug that&amp;#39;s used to treat hiv and it was also shown to increase frataxin in cells derived from patients and now this is in the phase two clinical trial in italy to study if it&amp;#39;s safe and if it&amp;#39;s affect its efficacy in people with fa and sck is funding a project with the same team in italy to test drugs that might have a similar structure function to a travelling and try and develop new drugs as well so having spoken about drugs and approaches to increase frataxin protein the last part that i&amp;#39;d like to talk to you about is development treatments that the target these disrupted processes such as the oxidative stress and the cell damage that you get within the mitochondria of cells of people with friedrich taxi and there&amp;#39;s a few approaches being um so the first one is by riata pharmaceuticals and it&amp;#39;s the homovoloxalone trial moxie trial now this drug targets oxidative stress and a particular pathway called the nrf2 signaling pathway that is affected in free drugs ataxia and it&amp;#39;s been a trial that&amp;#39;s been ongoing a number of countries around the world including a trial in the uk in the london texas centre there were two parts to it the results of the first part which had 69 people with friedrich ataxia helped show that it was safe and helped define the dose to be used in the second part of the study it also showed the activation of this nrf2 pathway that is affected in friedrichs ataxia an improvement in the mitochondrial function of cells so it looked like it was doing what they&amp;#39;re expecting it to do this particular trial was small and it was not designed it was not powered to see any improvement in ataxia although there were some benefits in a modified fars and ataxia rating scale the results of part two which involved 103 people with friedrux ataxia involved people taking the drug over 48 weeks and there was a statistically significant improvement in their symptoms associated with fa compared to people who were on the placebo trial and the results of this the top-line results of this were announced by riata towards the end of last year and there was a lot of excitement the next step was to discuss with the regulators with the fda in the u.s to see whether the data provided was sufficient to get the drug approved as a treatment for freedix ataxia now unfortunately the fda came back saying that there was a need for another trial to take place to confirm these results and as i understand they&amp;#39;re now discussions between riata and the regulators as riyadh proposed maybe using some of the data that is already available from the extension phase of this one-year trial because the trial continued with everybody on the drug so hopefully they will be able to to get more data to convince the regulators and to prove whether this treatment is is a true positive treatment that could be used for to treat people with free drugs ataxia then there are rules of approaches that are being used so ptc therapeutics has an antioxidant that they&amp;#39;re looking that has shown some positive results in small phase two trials and they&amp;#39;re now starting a larger one in a number of countries in europe minorics therapeutics is a company is testing a ppar gamma activator in people with fa this is what their drug does and this ppar gamma is a protein found in cells and any free drugs it cannot function properly so the idea is to activate it and see whether you get improvements in fa and a phase one clinical trial showed that this drug was well tolerated in terms of the safety and it was able to reach the brain which is obviously where you need it to get to and there&amp;#39;s now a phase two trial ongoing in a number of european countries and lastly resveratrol which is a naturally occurring compound found in the skin of grapes and it potentially improves mitochondrial function and this resveratrol is being trialled in fa in a trial in australia looking at trying to develop treatments that might stop the progression or improve the condition and free drugs ataxia there are also a number of approaches to provide symptomatic relief for a number of the associated problems issues that people food rights have some of you have slurred speech and so we funded a speech therapy project which tried to provide a treatment to improve the speech so the speech was assessed in the weeks before the therapy in terms of the volume the speed the intelligibility of the speech and then this therapy treatment was provided over skype online making it very easy for participants to take place to participate and then the speech was assessed again after weeks of therapy using the same parameters the volume the speed of the tangibility patients were asked to complete questionnaires to see how they felt as well and how their speech might have been improved and the results showed that they were quite positive and the participants had more breath available to speak and this resulted in improvements in their voices which sounded less strained so although the study did not show improvements in the abilities to other people to understand participants it did show that most participants felt that they were clear and they had to repeat themselves less and were more confident so it sounds like they&amp;#39;re really positive things that came out of this study so professor annie lowett who is a researcher who did this study is now planning further studies and they&amp;#39;re suggesting that this particular treatment called lsbt should be considered by speech and language therapists who are treating people with ataxia provided it&amp;#39;s closely monitored and if you&amp;#39;re interested in knowing more about this do contact at texas uk on our helpline and there is also a breakup session at this annual conference this afternoon and on saturday so you can talk to professor loit directly project that we have been involved with has been a project called physical activity for people with rare neurological conditions and it was developed by researchers at ucl and cardiff together with other groups of researchers and attacks uk was invited to be one of the patient representative groups and the aim is to understand the level of physical activity among people with rare neurological conditions and we were pleased that the taxes were included in this project and once this information was gathered in a number of surveys and different interviews and different qualitative research the next step is to develop a self-management program to support physical activity in people with rare neurological conditions and the researchers are now trying to get funding to do the second part of the project which would hopefully result in quite a practical help to people with ataxia and thank you to everybody who participated in the survey that we distributed some time ago now so we&amp;#39;ve spoken about physical activities about speech therapy there are also potentially drug therapies that could help with improving the ataxia symptom so not necessarily a treatment long term but it could be a symptomatic relief and the company in tribal who we&amp;#39;ve been working with for a while now recently announced some positive results for their drug acetylene leucine the modified version of acetone leucine that was in a clinical trial in niemann-pick type c this neiman-pick type c is a neurodegenerative condition which has ataxia as a symptom and the drug targeted the ataxia symptom and including it showed an improvement in the scara score as part of the trial so they found that the ataxia improved in these patients and they&amp;#39;re carrying on the trial in other conditions such as ataxia telangiectasia and other neurodegenerative conditions and the hope here is that if they&amp;#39;re able to prove that this treatment could be effective in relieving the symptoms of ataxia it could be generalized to other ataxias as well potentially including free drugs at xa2 the last approach i wanted to mention was cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation trial so recent studies reported that reply applying a low electrical current to the scalp may alleviate symptoms of ataxia and the group in italy have produced these results and we&amp;#39;re now funding them to do a trial in italy it involves a range of taxes including free drugs ataxia and we&amp;#39;re hoping to get the initial results in early 2022. similar techniques are also being carried out around the world such as trials in canada and brazil so this is another approach that may provide some symptom relief for the ataxia and they&amp;#39;re trying to see as well how long term this might be how long the treatment effect might last so the last bit of this talk was to talk a little bit about some opportunities to take part in research and we&amp;#39;re focusing on people in the uk although some of these initiatives might be relevant for outside the uk as well first one is the fa global patient registry so many charities such as the taxi uk or fd have patient registries which we have used to recruit for trials and research studies however some time ago we all got together with other attacks of charities around the world to create the new international registry the fa global patient registry which is a global effort of all these patient groups to work together and pull the information in one place so there is much more powerful resource for research so why do we need patient registries when researchers are developing new drugs they need to understand the disease and they need to understand the experiences of patients and by gathering this information in one place we can get as much as possible from a larger number of patients so that this can be more useful for research purposes we also need in order to run clinical trials we need to be able to find patients in different countries who are willing to be part of these trials and so this registry was built to collect more information about fa directly from people with it and to help match patients to studies that they may be interested in as well so if you&amp;#39;re interested in registering the website is shown on the slide and we also have the link from the ataxia uk website we&amp;#39;d be really grateful if more people registered so far we have more than nearly 700 people with fa who have registered since november 2019 and they&amp;#39;re from 40 different countries so it really is a truly global effort so please do register if you&amp;#39;re interested and just to sort of clarify that being a friend of a tax uk is a different thing from joining this fa global registry so even if you are a friend of a taxi uk please do feel free to join the registry and help in the research effort the second project that some people might be able to participate in is the efax project so this is a multi-site european natural history study and we have a site in the uk in london at the taxi center which is still recruiting and the idea is for patients with freedom to taxi to attend annual meetings annual visits at the clinic and a number of pieces of information are gathered such as ataxia rating scales and the data generated from this large study in different european countries is being used currently to design clinical trials to test medications the initial funding came from the eu then patient groups via euro ataxia joined in providing some some interim funding and attacks the uk was one of the groups that provided funding and now there are pharma partners who are funding it showing the importance of this kind of work also to the pharma partners who are trying to develop treatments for free drugs ataxia so if you&amp;#39;re interested in joining the details on our website and you can contact paulo join team to take part lastly there&amp;#39;s the nicotinamide trial which we have mentioned a number of trial times and unfortunately it has been delayed the start has been delayed however we do aim to recruit about 90 people to the nicodemic trial in london alone when recruiting starts and then there are a number of other sites around the europe and so the sites will be at imperial and ucl again with paolo duity being one of the sites so do look out on our website and magazine and newsletters from full information as to when the recruitment will start on this important study we also have a number of healthcare surveys that we we run every so and they&amp;#39;re on our website so we&amp;#39;re doing one over 19 and ataxia and this is for people with a taxi that have either had or believe they have had covered 19. we&amp;#39;re working with our tax ck&amp;#39;s medical advisors in the hope to learn more about the impact of cover 19 on people with ataxia and be able to inform people with ataxia and their doctors as to the information useful information that might come out of this survey and another survey is one that&amp;#39;s been run by google in a project called project euphonia and the google ai for social program contacted us at taxi uk asking us if we would help facilitate collecting some speech samples from people with speech difficulties so people with ataxia who have slurred speech and speech difficulties in order to improve their voice recognition technology so we&amp;#39;re hoping that people might be interested in taking part in providing some speech samples so that the speech recognition technology could be adapted to help people with ataxia and dysarthria in the future and just all the studies for which we&amp;#39;re looking participants both the surveys and the more interventional studies will be on our website in the taking part in research section of our website thank you very much for your attention and if you do have any questions my email address is here on the slides thank you",

    "transcript": "foreign who is Professor of pediatrics at the University of California San Diego her research project is focused on the molecular characterization of cystinosis and metabolic circulatory disease and gene therapy welcome Stephanie anyway thank you very much for inviting me it&amp;#39;s a pleasure to talk to you today yeah thanks for doing this so um obviously I don&amp;#39;t know much about systemosis I gathered it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a rare disease incidence rates in the range of one to one hundred thousand or something of those lines so really rare uh disease it is a genetic uh disorder and so you have to have fathers and mothers Gene disorders sort of come together so that both of your that particular genius this has a problem for the disease to appear um so you say here you have a number of papers in this area I know that you have been doing research in this area for a long time cystenosis is a autosomal recessive metabolic disease that belongs to the family of lysosomal storage disorders um and so the little I understand about this is that there are materials inside the cells that uh for whatever reason because of the gene disorder the cells cannot get rid of so you have an accumulation problem in the cells right so so what exactly is systemosis yeah so actually yes I have been involved in cystinosis for a very long time I did actually my PhD in cystinosis and we actually identify the gene involved into this disease and so the gene called ctns and code lysosomal transform transporter of cysteine so this all over system the amino acid cysteine to exit the lysosome so the lysosome is kind of a recycled being of the cells and you know this is we have a protein are enter of the the lysosome and they have they are cut in many amino acids and the uh assisting us to exhibit like the zone to be reused by the cells um but and cystinozine the transporter of cysteine is a missing or non-functional in the patient with stenosis the issue is that sorry it&amp;#39;s not interrupt Stephanie so let me see if I can understand this so the lysosome is inside the cell yeah and cysteine is is a protein so it&amp;#39;s like a one of a breakdown from the protein so the protein contains cysteine and so when the protein and turbulized Zone to be recycled is break down by you know several amino acids actually a system is too sustained together and um it requires transporter to be able to exit the lysosome so the sellers if I understand this you know purely from a mechanical perspective the lysosome is sort of a manufacturer of cysteine and in a normal cell there is a transport mechanism it can take that out and into the bloodstream so so I have two questions um why do we need why does the body need uh cysteine what what is the what is the function so system is part of the protein so every protein in our body requires cysteine so um it&amp;#39;s like Arginine or any over amino acid so uh it&amp;#39;s required for the protein actually cysteine is is a is a two system together and when it&amp;#39;s exits the lysosome and it&amp;#39;s going to acetoplasm it&amp;#39;s a breakdown into C to sustain and with it&amp;#39;s reused by the cells to make proteins so it&amp;#39;s almost like a starting material yes but you know it&amp;#39;s like a building block you know that you need to make a house or something um but the the issue is that ctns is expressing every single tissue in our body so when uh in the patient who have a mutation in ctns so voxy stenosis actually accumulate cysteine in all the organs so the lysosome become dysfunctional so the cells becomes this dysfunctional and starts to create the sitting crystals in the license that are characteristic of this building of system storage and eventually the cells die so little by little progressively all the organs in in the body fell in the patient with cystenosis and so we start by uh the kidney so we are the first organ to be affected for this stenosis it&amp;#39;s not going to fully understand understood why we you know it&amp;#39;s the first organ but it&amp;#39;s the system in infancy we have dysfunctional kidney and eventually if a patient um have instead renal failure and require kidney transplantation but this patient also accumulates it in crystals in the cornea which leads to photophobia and eventually blindness um they also have endocrine dysfunction myopathy so Mr weakness but also lead to their death um they have neurological defect uh Etc you know you name it it&amp;#39;s like this patient unfortunately have very profound organ defect and poor quality of life yeah so it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a really bad disease in many ways um but going back to the mechanics of this so in a normal cell there&amp;#39;s a transport mechanism you call this here protone-driven cysteine transporter it&amp;#39;s an enormous cell uh it can basically take it out of the lysosome and put that into the bloodstream when you have this problem you don&amp;#39;t have that transporter so essentially things are getting accumulated right in the lysosome it just sits there yeah yeah and it doesn&amp;#39;t take in the bloodstream you take it from the lysosome to the cytoplasm where it&amp;#39;s reused but father cellmostasis um and yes in because the system transporter is missing then you know the the system is stuck within the lysosome and accumulate yeah I can&amp;#39;t even imagine what this situation I mean I know that there are multiple types of uh system officers there&amp;#39;s early onset um late onset and uh like just ocular systems uh but but if it is accumulating in the cells that is not a sustainable process is it I mean what happens they get it customizes and you know what goes on yeah yeah so this is all the patients of this very accumulation of Chris of Citizen crystals which actually help public diagnosis because if they are very suspicion of of stenosis they usually try to see you know of um system research for example and see if um if you have crystals then we can have a diagnosis of 16 uses yeah so the the crystallization of this is a sort of a systemic problem is happening everywhere and so there could be a lot of different organs uh ultimately involved but there&amp;#39;s a specific variety that affects the eye more than the the other organs so actually it affects [Music] so it&amp;#39;s not completely understood why um you know the the Kenya was first affected and all the patients require kidney transplantation tissue to be affected is indeed the eye with a um abundant accumulation of crystals in within the cornea so um so I know that you know the uric acid for instance crystallizes and it gives people gout but this is very different from that right this is a systemic every cell is involved in this process right yeah you know it&amp;#39;s very different actually some people miss you know um mistake with you know assistiness with your uh uroma but it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not the same thing at all and the accumulation of crystals is you know inside with cells and which make it very um which make it very um a critical disease because uh with this accumulation with cell dye and eventually well again so so a lot of your focus has been gene therapy so essentially that plant Sporter is missing uh the ideal situation would be to replace the transporter on every cell it&amp;#39;s easier said than done right I don&amp;#39;t even know how do you go about doing that I I wouldn&amp;#39;t have known either I mean actually yeah you do a gene therapy uh very early on and for my PhD already which you know was too early to do a PhD on on gene therapy but I started to work on systemosis and I um I was and I thought it would be very nice to go from the gene to gene therapy so we um I started to work on cyst you know this with this in mind but when we start we found the gene we first realized it was expressed in every single tissue we secondly realized that it was a non-secritic protein with a transporter um that was the worst disease model to do gene therapy on um so yeah I wouldn&amp;#39;t have chose chosen this this is at all if I would have to go back um but actually I&amp;#39;m glad I did because um after um when I became a faculty and I knew the tools for gene therapy I you know I was already involved a lot with a family and the community which is Genesis and and it was now a personal fight but I really wanted to find a better treatment for these patients um so of course how do you bring a gene everywhere especially when it&amp;#39;s not secreted so you really have to to Target the most sales possible and so that&amp;#39;s why I turned to ex Vivo gene therapy in contrast to in Vivo gene therapy the individual gene therapy that when you um inject into the body a viral Vector containing the missing Gene so and most of the time you use adenosocytic virus the issue with individual gene therapy is that the you are very constrained with a dose and it&amp;#39;s impossible to Target all the tissue with in Vivo gene therapy so um so that wouldn&amp;#39;t be okay for this kind of disease where you have to really bring the healthy protein in most of the tissues so I chose to then to go to the Exogen therapy meaning that we are using the stem cells to that we generally correct or Gene modify X Vivo before we put them back into the body and actually there were two um you know the bonus stem cells that we have in our um all of us in our bone marrow a really good ability to be able to Target every single tissue in our body if we have any kind of injury so I was thinking you know maybe because in system this patient all the tissue are damaged so we might the cells might be able to uh and graft into this tissue and so I we have two main bone marrow stem cells in our bone marrow the mesenchymar stem cells that make you know tissue cells and the hematopoietic stem cells that give rise to blood cells so I really believe that the Amazon Timber stem cells would be the one that would really make a difference because we want to Target tissue cells and I use rheumatoid extensors as a negative control but Against All Odds um I realized that soap Amazon to my stem cells at only uh transient beneficial effect because now we know that we cannot ungraft long-term and tissues but unexpectedly the hematopoietic stem cells add a very dramatic impact on the tissue on the disease so first we found a lot of hematopoietic stem cells they arrive says that ungraphed into all the organs and we will realize that it led to a dramatic decrease of assisting content in all these organs and a long-term preservation of these tissues of a kidney the thyroid the eye Etc so that was a very um amazing and inspected research and again because you know the super protein is not secreted so what we realized there um was um that actually the methopedic stem cells what they become is that we become because they give rise to a lot of hematopoietic cells or blood cells but the monocyte in the blood cells have a variability to become macrophage into the organs into the brain and we realized that the macrophages the reason because they become resident macrophage so we and graph long term into the tissues they have the ability to transfer the lysosome via tunneling nanotubes so the tunneling nanotubes are very long tubular protrusion that can make a bridge between cells so connection and deliver the lysosome carrying the system protein in this case so that was a kind of a novel mechanism of action to explain how hematopoxic stem cells could rescue diseases like cyst stenosis and so this is what the innovation of of my lab so I don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m going to understand it um Stephanie so in some sense you need some sort of a messenger to to remedy the issue in almost every every cell in the body and stem cells some type of stem cells appear to do that in this case but instead of sort of a platform technology in the sense that if there&amp;#39;s a systemic genetic disorder could use the same idea for others for other other diseases you are completely right so now um what happened is um atopoietic stem cells in disease that was not thought to be able to walk we were able to make a intellectual property on on that um on that kind of disease and so we uh so it was like the luxoma disease due to a trust membrane lies on my protein and so we were able to show that this works or so in another lysomic disease called Danone disease with my collaborator uh Eric Adler um it works on this disease for many years as a cardiologist and actually the patient with Danone require a heart transplant they also have a eye defect and logical defect and the protein involved is a lump to be protein which is also a transmembrane azamite protein and so when you saw me um when they you know presenting a two csds or so from UCSD he said hey where does it go and why don&amp;#39;t we try on you know on that and then sure enough so if we tried and we were able to rescue the disease and we did the same thing when for 16oz so we developed X Vivo gene therapy approach and we also now starting the safety study for um one day starting a clinical trial prices for denim yeah I would imagine the mechanics of this is quite um quite complicated it&amp;#39;s importantly dangerous but uh it&amp;#39;s sort of swapping out uh existing bone marrow uh in some way with the with replacement uh with the genetic modification rate is that the yeah and that&amp;#39;s an important point so uh you know if with this kind of of research you would think okay so why don&amp;#39;t we do a bone marrow transplant actually a bone marrow transplant when you text themselves from a donor foreign Doner there has high risk of mortality and morbidity associated with that more than 20 percent of risk um because of these grav versus host disease you know you are putting cells that are not sure so uh often time they you know will react against your body and you can die from that actually one patient who was 16 years old has been transplanted with adult transplant so you know using a foreign Belgium based on our work and unfortunately the patient died from these processes and they still so you know benefits from the transported metabolic stem cells for cystenosis disease but you know and the the patient died from growth disease so it is very important to understand that you know you you cannot do bone marrow transplant any patient very risky so what we have what we have to do and what is much safer to do is to actually take the patient on bone marrow stem cells and metabolic stem cells and to Gene modify themaging correct them ex Vivo and then we can transplant them back by doing a bone marrow transplant so this require a short-term midlo ablation so using a solo short-term chemotherapy to remove the patient&amp;#39;s own bone marrow stem cells of this Max space into their bone marrow and then when we Infuse the gene modified hematopoetic stem cells they will go to the bone marrow by themselves reside there multiply there and for the rest of the life of a patient so now we have a reservoir of healthy cells for the rest of the life of a patient and as we&amp;#39;ve shown is that when it&amp;#39;s required because of tissue damage they will travel to the tissue and graft and provide the healthy protein to the disease cells so that&amp;#39;s kind of a really self-regulated one-time treatment that is very powerful actually so there&amp;#39;s no rejection risk if you do it and there is actually no registration except if for any reason a patient of a can of the body kill a new protein that you are adding so there are also a safety study that you always have to to verify but it&amp;#39;s more rare uh but you can you always have to verify that but you know in the case of cystenosis for instance you know there is no no issue on um immune reaction against the system is in protein for patients who have who don&amp;#39;t have it but there is no risk of rejection from the in my from the stem cells themselves yeah so if I understand this character Stephanie so you take uh part of the bone marrow of the patient and you modify it uh with the with the with the vector and you don&amp;#39;t take all of it right you take some bits of it and then you grow it do you grow it so so what we do it exactly is that we mobilize the hematopoxic stem cells so we call that the cd34 hematopoietic stem cells stem and progenitor cells so we use the um so we first mobilize them in the bloodstream and we do what we call anaphoresis so it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s a machine that will take the white blood cells and send back the red blood cells into your blood so that&amp;#39;s what you can take much more and from these authorities bag we isolate the cd34 hematopoetic stem cells so this has to be done in what we call a good manufacturing practice facility and so um these four cyst stenosis it was done at the GMP facility directed by Donald cone um and this is where the gene modification of it says were done before and after characterize make sure they are safe to transplant and then they were able to be transplanted or infused reinfused into the patients reinfusing the patients so so the the chemotherapy aspect of this is essentially removing what is there by chemotherapy yes it&amp;#39;s to remove your own bone marrow stem cells so like that the one that have not been Gene corrected they will be removed it has to be otherwise the the new stem cells are not on grafting into the bone marrow right right yeah I mean it&amp;#39;s a big big process um and in the middle the patient is at risk from almost the immune system I would imagine is sleeping yeah I mean we completely replace so I mean so the risk after you know um after this kind of uh burnout transplant the patient assisted three weeks three to four weeks in the hospital because um they there is the risk fat is uh existed that we are not prone to get infection and do not have their their immune cells to fight it so we have to be in a secure place you know in the hospital uh to where you know but bone marrow transplant is is happening every day you know for many disorders um like you know cancer Etc so you know people are used to doing that as is very safe environment yeah I mean there are no options it sounds to me I know there&amp;#39;s a chemical agent that is more symptomatic isn&amp;#39;t it I mean it&amp;#39;s not uh it&amp;#39;s not a cure uh so wherever where they don&amp;#39;t know about chemotherapy yeah what is it called there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a medicine that&amp;#39;s used for the disease right a chemical agent oh oh sorry yeah yeah so um so the the drug that currently exists process you know this is called sister Amin and it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a chemical that enter the lysosome and is able to break down the cysteine and so after the 68 in is able to to exit the lysosome um but it&amp;#39;s just delay the progression of a disease so it&amp;#39;s very important because before the patients were dying very early from the disease now they can live until young alert um but still you know um they still develop the complication uh they still have a poor quality of life but um with this drug it very we are really able to live longer um but clearly it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s a need of better treatment and you know that&amp;#39;s the reality for most of virginity disorder very often they lead to profound tissue damage and poquility of life and most of it our treatment um cannot be addressed by a regular medication and this is when we you know why I think you know gene therapy is really the future of medicine for this kind of disorder um and we see that more and more now because um before it was considered science fiction now we have more and more um FD approved uh gene therapy product for genetic disorder and we see a a very dramatic impact of of this gene therapy product compared to to regular treatment yeah we don&amp;#39;t know anything about this Stephanie so I was wondering if it is purely genetic disorder why have you seen uh late onset for the disease shouldn&amp;#39;t everything be early no that&amp;#39;s a very good question so um we are different a kind of mutation in the case of cystenosis that we can find the City nurse Gene and we have done uh so during my PhD we have done some um uh some functionalities that determine the impact of a mutation in the protein and what we&amp;#39;ve shown is that in the infantile form of a disease most of the mutation leads to the non-functional protein you know where there is no transport of cysteine at all in the later form of a disease we can measure some residual transport of system and so that&amp;#39;s why the phenotype is uh is less less important yeah so since I get the mutations that we&amp;#39;re seeing I I don&amp;#39;t remember the the name of the CNT something what was that yes yes yes yeah and so so I guess there&amp;#39;s a gradation there in terms of so it&amp;#39;s not a pure case is it I mean so you could have some small amounts of Transportation going on uh even though yeah so uh for example in the juvenile form we have uh seen some some some reason direct transport there is also a ocular form of cyst stenosis that is found in adult and in that case we found a much higher level of transport of systems so you know it depends of how much sitting I can still be transported and but determined the phenotype Stephanie so the this is sort of a starting material for a lot of protein production if it is not getting there then a variety of other issues are going to happen to the body right forces yeah yes I mean that&amp;#39;s why we have that&amp;#39;s why the patients have a kidney failure blindness uh muscle weakness endocrine dysfunction so yeah I mean there is a lot of defect in each organs that leads to the organ failure yeah I know that you have another paper here um which is sort of in the same same line so Frederick&amp;#39;s it takes here so what is that uh it is also an autosomal versus neurodegenerative disease so but what what&amp;#39;s happening there so the why we started to work on Friday so first of all I was not at all from Amir I mean I always tell me I heard about this disease because uh when I was in PhD I was working with someone a colleague who had a son with freak A texture so that&amp;#39;s why that&amp;#39;s the first one that came to my mind when we wanted to work on mitochondrial disease so why I got interested in mitochondrial diseases because the tunneling nanotube that can transport the lysosome can also transport mitochondria so I was thinking if we can make a difference in my transporter you know so like because of the organ that can be transported or transferred maybe we can do the same in mitochondrial disease and so again this was novel and um in the field of gene therapy for mitochondrial disease and I was like okay let&amp;#39;s try to make um uh proof of concept so again because I knew I am my colleague had a a son with his disease and this is also a terrible disease where um the patients are born you know normal and suddenly they start to have locomotor deficiency and they get this diagnosis of friction and it&amp;#39;s a really a deaf sentence where the patient will progressively lose is locomotorability will end up in a wheelchair and for years and um end up dying from cardiac dysfunction so it&amp;#39;s very terrible and despite of a fact that um many people work on many groups many um investigators work on this disease for many years and there is no treatment that can really stop the disease so I I you know instead of going after the neurons or you know trying because it&amp;#39;s neurologic everybody thinks okay we have to fix the neurons um I was thinking maybe let&amp;#39;s go to another approach where you know we know because what we&amp;#39;ve learned and what others have shown is that the imatopoietic stem cells can become machoglial access in the brain and this microglia have actually they are really important for him will move studies of the of the neurons and they you know be variable to to transfer a lot of things you know to neuron so I was thinking maybe they can also transfer the missing protein here so we did the proof of concept in the mice we feel detection and it was really like a traumatic impact I mean I always remember when I was with my postdoc and we went for first time testing the mice with you know you put the mice in some behavioral tasting you know it&amp;#39;s a machine that can you know you can see how they react and we could tell which one at receive the world type hematopoietic stem cells as opposed to the one that receive a disease cells it is really black and white I mean it was really a huge impact and it was really amazing moment and so we knew it was working but after we&amp;#39;re like okay now we have to understand why and actually the primary defect is the depth of neurons in the docile ganglia which I didn&amp;#39;t even know where it was at the time so we had to learn um but um yeah after which we realized is that actually yeah the hematopoietic stem cells were becoming microglia luxers in the CNS dorsal ganglia and we were able to to transfer the fratoxin protein to the neurons and to prevent the neuronal death and so that was very important um findings and so we took the disease from completely another angle and now we have received uh you know a found from the serum California Institute of regenerative medicine and pharah the advocacy group to really move forward with treatment to a clinical trial so we are now at the stage of a safety studies um so we are already making great progress we are we will have our first interaction with the FDA early next month to know exactly what is required to to get to a legal trial so we are very excited by this work too yeah so from a Layman&amp;#39;s perspective Stephanie I&amp;#39;m thinking this is this appears to be sort of a very Broad application if I understand this correctly you you take some type of stem cells you modify them and you modify them in such a way that it has a systemic effect on the body uh and there could be many diseases that that this could influence yeah one of the people here in Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease um which is a little different you see here stem and progenitor sell transportation leads to complete preservation of neurocognitive performance and partial conservation of blood brain barrier Integrity so so what what is the what is the concept here in all signers so again from it&amp;#39;s uh you know from cities are rare disease we went to fully cataxia another reality knows this and we learned so much from cystinosis with a mechanism of action that we were able to apply but to pre-cataxia from Freddy cataxia we learn the power of the metabolic stem cells and others have shown that also for metacromatic record dystrophy I don&amp;#39;t know and we are in clinical trial so we know this is translated to Human so and after on in Alzheimer it&amp;#39;s like um the the cause of Alzheimer is still not really well understood um some people say that it&amp;#39;s because of the black accumulation some people is say it&amp;#39;s because of a blood brain barrier some people you know everybody has their um their own um hypotheses uh but you know some people who are saying that the macroglia cells uh actually that their neuroinflammation microbial cells might be involved in the pathogenesis and the neural degeneration so we&amp;#39;re thinking if this is true then if we use a few hematopoietic stem cells maybe we can stop the progression of Alzheimer&amp;#39;s so that was the rationale behind this work um so again we tested that in the mice we tested the mice into this you know behavioral testing and again the results was really beyond our expectation when we could completely rescue the memory function or preserve neurocognitive function of the mice with a memory um the sense of danger Etc was completely preserved in this mice and what we&amp;#39;ve shown is actually that with no inflammation was uh very radius I mean it was non-existent whereas in the mice with Alzheimer uh there was this dramatic uh neuroinflammation and the macroglia cells there were so inflamming activated that they have a potential to eat the neurons so to lead to neurodegeneration so by using rheumatopoxic stem cell we completely stopped that and um and we believe that you know this is really a big part of a pathogenesis so obviously now we have two more Direction on this work it&amp;#39;s like we want to develop for the familial aiding a more gene therapy Exogen therapy approach like we have done for the stenosis or uh um free cataxia like we also want to understand better you know how the hematopoietic stem cells completely stop the progression of Alzheimer and I think this is very important for understanding disease and finding drug jackets so so if you understand this character so microglia inflammation if that is what&amp;#39;s causing it it&amp;#39;s a little bit of a runaway process right so you get information and it creates more information and then things go down and down down the drain from there and so are you saying that um you&amp;#39;re stopping inflammation or are you saying that you&amp;#39;re actually replay saying some of the cells so we are replacing the macroglia by Maria laxa and we are stopping preventing the inflammation now there are some some response to YouTube that we still have to figure out do if inflammation is already very intense can we regress that I mean reduce it I mean there are some things we still have to understand uh but in that case by replacing the macroglia by healthy one we completely prevent the inflammation and reactivation of a material access and we show that we stop completely the the progression of the disease itself so like you said they have a lot of hypotheses around the cause and the progression of Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease but if this technique you&amp;#39;re actually demonstrating the Improvement in neurocognitive performance then it should be sort of pointing in this direction right that is sort of the cause of it I would say that how many people would say differently you know I would you know I never saw um a disease where uh nobody agreed with each other so um you know I think that&amp;#39;s you know that&amp;#39;s what the beauty of of this I&amp;#39;m very excited by this about this project because uh there&amp;#39;s so much to learn uh so we are really making a big effort now to to understand this process because um yeah there is so much that is unknown um and that I think we have a perfect model to understand it so as we look forward in conclusion uh Stephanie so where do you think this research will go what areas are you really excited about and uh what you want to do in the next five years so I&amp;#39;m really excited by the the potential of exubergine therapy as you um as you said you know now we have a platform you know we can I really believe this is very powerful and there are many disorders that we can rescue with with this technology so this is what I really want you um to develop but I also want to develop gene therapy in general and I also have some a project when it&amp;#39;s individual gene therapy um but for some you know very specific tissues um I&amp;#39;m happy to see how gene therapy now is considered as part of medicine I have a course on gene therapy that and I remember that it was I started that six years ago and I had only one I saw medical student and graduate student and also Pharmacy student and I had only one medical student now it&amp;#39;s 50 of a student are from a medical field so I think now even you know the physician really consider that also part of a medicine so for me it&amp;#39;s a big um it&amp;#39;s a big victory and I also now I just recently launched the gene therapy initiative at UCSD with philanthropic funds and I the goal of that is to really help people to develop gene therapy there are many people who works on disease and have the perfect disease model for gene therapy but they don&amp;#39;t know maybe how to do weight or we don&amp;#39;t have a phone to start you know this kind of project and so this is what we want to do so I really want to support the development therapy in general um would you say from a medical practitioner&amp;#39;s perspective in Vivo they can they can understand it they can manage it actually versus a process isn&amp;#39;t it I mean you manage both I mean as to where you know there are many clinical trials within Vivo gene therapy uh and in many examples um but actually for two um for example so forces we develop that here and you know um you know all the Physicians got on board and you know they are doing a great job but there are many other uh example as I said metacromatically dystrophy I don&amp;#39;t know this trophy sickle cell disease I mean there are many of them yes it&amp;#39;s a process yes we have to put in place but um at the end of the day it seems to be a very safe approach and so I truly believe that there are so much to learn about that and the power of it that it will become much more applicable and unused in medicine yeah excellent yeah good luck with everything that you&amp;#39;re doing I think it is very important work and if we can go in and modify cells and and genes uh we can kill a lot of diseases I think so this is try to do a lot of them excellent yeah thanks for spending time with me Stephanie thank you very much bye-bye",

gayer hi Michael thank you for being here thank you for having me Michael is gonna tell us a little bit about his story with the bay and his own experience but at the end of this we are gonna go more into the fact that Michael is currently on the new FDA approved drunk treatment for friedersonaxia so that&amp;#39;s coming up later but first Michael do you want to tell us a little bit about your story with fa sure do uh so when I was a young you know Boy chat whatever word you want to use there um I was always singing uh my family was very musical my parents met in a singing group in college um I always loved to sing uh so during a lot of my childhood performances if you actually look back you can see videos of ataxia you know happening starting when I&amp;#39;m about seven or eight um and then my my parents just kind of thought it was due to you know clumsiness he&amp;#39;s a lanky you know preteen Yeah Boy whatever they were they were pretty clumsy so they didn&amp;#39;t really think it was anything that required action uh but in fifth grade um I had an overnight camping field trip and my teachers told my parents that I was kind of having trouble keeping up I was kind of following a lot um just having trouble with some of the activities that my classmates were doing uh and this was in 20 11 I think the first half of 2011. um and then in December of 2011 I was diagnosed with charcoal Murray tooth which is not fa I&amp;#39;ve actually I&amp;#39;ve heard a lot of people are misdiagnosed with that at first um that&amp;#39;s normally the most common misdiagnosis that I&amp;#39;ve heard of CMT I believe only affects I mean affects one in 2500 and Fa 150 000 so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really 20 times more common um but there wasn&amp;#39;t a blood test for CMT that was inclusive so it came back negative and they just assumed it was CMT because the symptom smashed up I had follow-up appointments every every year in December for uh you know just kind of a check up see how I was doing and uh in December of 2015 my neurologist said that I was progressing a little faster than she might have expected ultimately she did a blood test she had a suspicion about what it might be of course that lives of the diagnosis of fa in January of 2016 January 19th is my diagnosis day it was kind of a weird experience overall because when anyone is diagnosed with happy you know they it&amp;#39;s a devastating experience right it&amp;#39;s your whole world kind of yes uh but when I was diagnosed with CMT it has a very slow progression and uh if it doesn&amp;#39;t affect life expectancy at all so when I was diagnosed with you know nothing when I was a child and then going to CMT it was a little shift um and then when I was went from CMT to fa that was another little shift it really went from nothing to something bad to something terrible rather than from nothing just to fa do you still sing not in any capacity only to myself or in the car or yeah nothing nothing good so my issue a lot with talking is I will run out of breath before I&amp;#39;m finished speaking and so the end of my sentences will kind of run out and uh I was told that singing might help with that so I&amp;#39;m an awful singer I&amp;#39;ve never been good at singing but I was in choir I don&amp;#39;t know why but I knew I bought a karaoke machine and that is my uh Speech Therapy is a karaoke yeah I own I mean I I don&amp;#39;t know fully how much this is true but I&amp;#39;ve always thought in my speech is maybe slightly better than average uh because of all the singing I was doing um I feel like my lung capacity is pretty good uh you know I&amp;#39;m not ignorant I know that my speech is affected but I I think maybe not this much I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m not sure it&amp;#39;s hard to gauge sometimes because everyone is so different you use a manual wheelchair correct yes I do yeah and when did you start using the wheelchair so I started using the chair in December of 2017. um it was over my winter break we were taking a trip to Mexico actually and it was it was very nice for me to have a chair there because we were doing a lot of walking around and stuff I kind of had the same but I started using a travel scooter whenever like like you said we went on trips where it was harder to walk a lot and then I didn&amp;#39;t start using a wheelchair until a couple years leaner full time um I went straight into a power wheelchair because I have an older brother who has a pain and he started with a manual and then went to a power assist manual and then went to a full power chair and we kind of saw how he progressed and how I&amp;#39;m progressing very very similarly if not slightly faster um so we decided like just skip those steps because trying to get insurance to approve those things they&amp;#39;re so hard some are like just straight said power chair and for me it gave me a lot more Independence I had that freedom and you know I wasn&amp;#39;t exhausted every time I try to go somewhere um I gave a speech at my high school Baccalaureate actually um where I finally enough compared getting into real or you know starting to use a wheelchair with uh basically graduating from high school and going off to college or whatever in the world um just try new things and taking uh adventurous steps that use the wrong word um in in a New Direction so I want to ask you about the Hat you&amp;#39;re wearing uh what exactly is that so uh after I was diagnosed um and did the clinical trial I wanted to do something uh you know about fake uh react in some way if you will um and I ended up actually holding the screening in 2017 I think it was March or April it was probably April of 2017 of a movie called The ataxium which is great and is available on YouTube so if you haven&amp;#39;t seen that go watch it but uh that was an amazing screening and uh it raised I think over thirty two thousand dollars and there were more than 250 people there it was a great experience um yeah and then after after that screening my parents and I were talking and we were like well we want to abuse something else but we don&amp;#39;t want to like show the same movie again um so we knew that we wanted to incorporate my love of and appreciation for music um I also have a brother named Thomas who&amp;#39;s very very musically gifted um I wanted to do something with my friends and his friends and some people from school and stuff uh to to ultimately to to be a fundraiser to ultimately purify fast so thus the Cure face warrior was born um lots of small performances and we have a silent auction now with Ryan to local artwork and tons of fun um in 2018 we raised I think over sixty four thousand dollars um and from that on it was 120 120 000 in 2019 we went virtual and we took a set back because of that because of the pandemic in 2020 but in we grew again in 21 and 22 raising 155 and then 247 000 last year so this year the goal is 300. we&amp;#39;ll see so Michael in 2021 you reached out to me and I actually attended this way for the first time and I went back in 2022 and I&amp;#39;m planning to attend this year because it&amp;#39;s always been a great time you and your family have always done like a great job at putting on the event but also hosting and like you know being there for what I need or anyone else is there so I really appreciate that on y&amp;#39;all soon and I&amp;#39;m excited to go this year winning tickets go on sale for anyone who may want to attend so tickets are actually already on sale um you can go to give dot curface ra.org um and of course get more info at kiraface.org um one of the things that we&amp;#39;re really excited about this year is the addition of a research reception uh so basically Pharaoh was very happy with the fact that we had 24 fairs at the event last year uh and so they said hey would you like to have a research reception and that was great because we were already thinking that we kind of would so our plans went together well uh so we&amp;#39;ll be having a research reception and I believe the URL to register for that is research dot careface mario.org but every everything is all you care if it&amp;#39;s why it don&amp;#39;t work so if you go there you can find all the links you please go so sorry and the research reception brunch will be live streamed uh I don&amp;#39;t know the details for uh attending viewing the viewing the brunch viewing the recent perception uh virtually but the Soiree will be at live.cureface.org which is you know gonna be linked to our YouTube live whatever whatever going Live on YouTube is called that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to be doing on our Channel oh this is just curious hey sorry you might see me in it I think I was in it last year people told me that I guess that I think I saw you I&amp;#39;m like I was probably at the bar next if you&amp;#39;re okay with it and when I get into the fact that you&amp;#39;re on the first and only fa treatment right now so you&amp;#39;ve been on that for how long uh so right after my diagnosis my parents my dad especially took a huge interest in learning everything he could about fa uh learning about clinical trials that were happening um and that was January of 2016. so I was 15 years old when I was diagnosed and he found a clinical trial that was happening uh it was the locked alone trial it has a bunch of different names of locks alone Moxie omav RTA 408 Sky Claris so whatever you want to go with um anyway he found that clinical trial I was eligible to join once I turned 16. so I waited a couple months during that trial uh I was in part two of phase one I think the trial began phase one if I&amp;#39;m correct in January of 2015 uh I was in faith phase one part two in from March to I don&amp;#39;t know September October of 2016. two years later I was eligible to join the extension so as of today how long have you been on the drug and have you noticed anything at all so uh I&amp;#39;ve been on the extension for four years in a month um I was in the trial briefly for I think three months uh two years before that um the Ascension I believe that it has slowed my progression I&amp;#39;m not a doctor I can&amp;#39;t say that for certain um and you know I don&amp;#39;t know how I would have progressed in the last four years so if I had not been on it but I feel like I have not hit very many major milestones in terms of progression some things have gotten harder in the past four years um but I&amp;#39;m still transferring sometimes when I can uh I&amp;#39;m still pushing myself around campus so do you know any other people like from The Trial that are on the drug yeah I think I know uh I think I know four people that are currently on the drug um I know a couple more from that who have been on the drug uh one point and uh either weren&amp;#39;t eligible for the extension for whatever reason or uh I I don&amp;#39;t know just didn&amp;#39;t want to be on it for years and years uh but across the board I think that uh uh improvements with on the drug relative to patients either on Placebo or not on the drug were seen that said I will say that improvements you know relative to Baseline measures which are about as relative to how the participant was doing at the beginning of the trial uh those improvements were small and they were short-term and they were kind of like if you start exercising you might get better out of certain motion or doing a certain thing but you&amp;#39;re not going to regain an ability to even lost yeah so it&amp;#39;s definitely not a cure and I I think that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re trying to say here like not to give anyone false hope I&amp;#39;m also not trying to quell optimism it&amp;#39;s amazing for the community that this drug uh got FDA approved and I am more than happy to have been on it for the past four years just because where I fear I would be without it but it is you know a treatment that can hopefully slow down progression in hopes of finding a cure soon absolutely what do you think would be the type of person that would most benefit from the drug as you&amp;#39;ve seen how it affects you um is there any way like do you have an opinion on that I I think it will be best for people who are able to maintain some level of physical activity um and if that&amp;#39;s working out daily if that&amp;#39;s pushing yourself in your chair if that&amp;#39;s working out a couple times a week or once a week or twice a week or something um I think those are the people that will be helped close by moxie yeah you definitely need if not if you&amp;#39;re not already um working out and everything it definitely takes a commitment and a lifestyle change in order for you to see Improvement I feel like from what you&amp;#39;re saying everyone can work out I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not saying you have to be able to do some push-ups 50 sit-ups to have this work for you I&amp;#39;m just saying you have to be able to move around not not even that you have to try to move around right now the drug was just FDA approved a few weeks ago so it&amp;#39;s not available yet to everyone I don&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;ve heard they&amp;#39;re hoping to release it in May or June I I&amp;#39;ve heard late May uh I&amp;#39;m not sure about that but that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve heard yeah everyone&amp;#39;s just kind of going off of what they&amp;#39;re hearing and um it&amp;#39;s a very high demand right now especially like in the fa community so it&amp;#39;s definitely talked about a lot and I hope this can maybe give some insight to anyone who&amp;#39;s kind of completely in the dark about it um it&amp;#39;s definitely not a cure but it is a treatment if he worked towards it it can definitely help you in the long run but we are still trying to work towards liquor and I think it&amp;#39;s important to not let this treatment overshadow the fact that we are still trying to find a cure but obviously it is the great thing that has happened so it should be celebrated right now but there&amp;#39;s still a lot more work to go absolutely and uh for more Advanced Affairs um I think that frankly this news can be a bit difficult to hear because it can be I think a little Annoying to hear we have this treatment that&amp;#39;ll basically slow you down you won&amp;#39;t get you will get worse more slowly and some people I think hear that and they&amp;#39;re like well I want to get better but this is certainly a great first step yeah I think a lot of the issues that people are having right now is the fact that it is almost 400 000 a year um and I know they&amp;#39;re currently trying to get that you know paid through insurance which I&amp;#39;m sure will come in time it&amp;#39;s just we gotta wait for it but I know a lot of people I&amp;#39;ve spoken to in the later stages have been wary about pain that much knowing that they&amp;#39;re not able to do much um so I think that&amp;#39;s kind of what&amp;#39;s going on right now that&amp;#39;s a sentiment that I&amp;#39;ve heard expressed and frankly that I was fearful uh might happen um basically as soon as this was approved I was telling my parents that I was a little worried this was on the date of the approval I was a little worried that the approval of the heart on the fa Community because a lot of people maybe even most people want to see more from this young they don&amp;#39;t want to see a slower decline they want to see an incline they want things to get better it&amp;#39;s but I I was talking with my parents that I was like you know what will be worse and everybody what&amp;#39;s that and I was like if it&amp;#39;s not approved yeah it&amp;#39;s to have it approved is so great it&amp;#39;s such great precedent and again I will say I am super happy to have been on this drum and also I&amp;#39;m all admit that maybe I&amp;#39;m not able to speak on this with great Authority but Rihanna plans with insurance trying to get insurers to pay the bulk of the cost uh seem to be great um I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not able to fully analyze their plans but but they do seem to have have desires they they want to be the good guy right they they want to have provided a treatment that people can access they don&amp;#39;t want to have provided a treatment that people are going to be mad because it&amp;#39;s too expensive um the the short answer I think to who it will benefit the most is everyone um because imagine if you had started to take this five years ago and instead of being where you are now you&amp;#39;re only where you were two or three years ago it would have been better you can&amp;#39;t take this drug to get back to the past but you can take it to make the future uh come at you with less Force less speed so the long answer to who will benefit the most frankly I think is people who are walking because they will have instead of the progression instead of a life expectancy of 20 or 30 more years they will have a life expectancy of 40 or 50 or maybe 60 more years I I don&amp;#39;t know exactly the science but I I think that in the long run if we can get fa to where it&amp;#39;s made tested for at Birth and uh whereas the guy Claris is available for children um that would be ideal because then I think we can really minimize the effects of this disease yeah definitely um and even for people who aren&amp;#39;t walking um like for example I could not even stand up for longer than 10 seconds at one time a year ago um but by going to physical therapy and practicing that every week A year later I was able to walk down the aisle at my wedding and that&amp;#39;s without the drug so I can&amp;#39;t even imagine what may be possible with a drug I just think that no matter where you&amp;#39;re at it can always improve and for the longest time I thought it it couldn&amp;#39;t and I was told that no fa is Progressive you only get worse you&amp;#39;ll never get better I started physical therapy thinking that oh maybe I&amp;#39;ll you know stay in the same and not get much worse and then I I saw major Improvement obviously over a long span of time but I can&amp;#39;t imagine what the drug could do knowing that you can only do a lot without it so I think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s definitely don&amp;#39;t lose hope to anyone out there I&amp;#39;m in any stage of fa is definitely possible to improve and the event is in Edmond Oklahoma for anyone who may want to attend or if you join virtually I&amp;#39;m sure any donations would be greatly appreciated and I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve seen this Michael but I definitely think that part of all the money that humor is has contributed to the new FDA approved drug being out there I mean a lot of the funding was you know used for clinical trials and things like that yeah I mean I I really really hope so the Safari has only been going on for a couple years but um in terms of getting money to Farah and helping pharah be able to operate be able to continue operating to grow and stuff like that I I certainly hope you&amp;#39;re right um through the years we&amp;#39;ve spent I think over 700 000 to Pharaoh uh and it reached this year&amp;#39;s goal that it&amp;#39;ll be over a million so yes so definitely if any of you want to help donate maybe we can cure our face soon thank you Michael for talking to me and sharing your story in your experience with this drug because I don&amp;#39;t know a lot about it myself so it was definitely very informational even for me to hear so I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;ll help a lot of others even just to hear your own experience thank you so much Sydney yeah thank you guys for watching and I will see you in the next episode bye",

    "transcript": "welcome everybody um uh we&amp;#39;re going to talk a little bit about uh in the next 10 minutes or so about how Farah funds research and uh um just to let you know that I&amp;#39;m just the warm-up act because after me you&amp;#39;ll hear from three of the real show of this three investigator there were supposed to be four but unfortunately one of them is not feeling that well so but um I&amp;#39;ve heard darl talk earlier in the previous breakout session and it&amp;#39;s really good so stick around to to uh to listen to them and um so I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m lisar I&amp;#39;m the director of research at fair and as Kyle um pointed out yesterday I&amp;#39;m the one who spends the money that he raises uh that&amp;#39;s exactly how you introduced me yesterday um so um so how you know what what do we use that money that you guys all raised for uh we think that the most um impactful strategy to uh fund research is using different mechanisms and one of these mechanism is the fagr program which is a way where uh investigators who have who research fa have ideas proposed to us these ideas and um we found the ones that we think uh are getting us closer to Farah&amp;#39;s goal and Mission who that is to find treatments for fa uh the other um program um is in institutional programs like at the central of excellence in Philadelphia or the fa accelerator at abroad the fa Alliance at Oxford uh where we fund group of investigators in specific institutions these are longer term investments because we want to create this group of multidisciplinary expert er um increase the number of investigators that uh you know are interested in FA and research fa um and also we are trying to leverage some of the resources that these investigations already have and the third third way that we uh fund research is through director project we call them far director project where Farah staff identifies some of the biggest challenges biggest gaps in knowledge uh of the disease mechanism and and we go after investigators and try to get them to answer these questions and you know Pro research certain questions that are very important to us it represents the biggest gaps that we have um what I&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about today is mostly uh about how the grant program works but generally it also applies to the other U mechanism that we um apply so the gr program can be represent Ed as a cycle that starts at end with the knowledge that we have about the disease and this is important because of course uh that informs on the therapeutic development of the disease but also it tells us uh once we know exactly what we know what else do we need to know so we it exposes uh the gaps in knowledge that we have all those questions that we still have to caner and these represent our research priorities that we uh apply uh when investigators come to us with their ideas so we use these research priorities that we develop together with our expert in the field our scientific Advisory Board um and investigators we solicit application from investigators uh so that these research priority can be addressed uh these um investigators come to us with propos proposals we review the proposals um using experts in the field and then we fund the ones that we think are able to address better these priorities answer better these questions um throughout the the uh cycle of the grant we engage with investigators we keep in contact with them review the progress and then hopefully by the end of the project we will learn a little bit more about the disease and we use this knowledge to revise the priorities the research priority for the following year so that for the following cycle uh so that you know at each Cycles we learn a little bit more and we revise um what the big questions that we need to address are what the the the questions that we want to um address uh in FA these are uh are Grand types and as you can see here we have different uh few Cycles over the years and we have different um Grand types some that are aimed at um funding established investigators some that are aimed at funding young investigators in in the early stages of their career like the ones that you see sitting here next to me um other Grand types are General they you know the you can propose to us uh uh research topics that are very general um and others are more specific for example we have a grant to study specifically the heart disease in FA or a grant that uh in which we fund proposals that are more related to therapeutic development we also have grants to that encourage new investigators who have never worked in FA to come to the fa field and study fa okay so now a little bit more detail of what we fund and why we fund it we what kind of research we found and why we fund it and I wanted to start here because this um image shows the drug development process and because obviously ultimately uh is this a pointer sort because this is our goal right to get to an effective treatment in FA we have an first approved drug but this is not the end of the road um fa is a very complex disease you heard it earlier uh today we need need a cocktail to address all the different components of fa and you know this is how a drug is developed the first stage here is a lot of basic research where you try to understand the disease as much as possible um you try to understand all the molecular processes that are involved in the um the manifestation of the disease and all these molecular processes represent present um therapeutic targets things that we can Target with a drug then we have the next phase is the preclinical development where all these potential drugs are tested for example in cell models animal models to determine whether these drugs are indeed efficacious in these models and also to test to study a little bit more the property of these potential drugs like the pharmacolog iCal properties whether they&amp;#39;re toxic or not and then you have clinical trials where these molecules are tested in people um and so you know one thing that I wanted to point out to you is that how this this um uh representation of the drug development process it&amp;#39;s kind of a funnel right so you see a lot of stuff here a lot of drugs a lot of different targets and then you know the number of the drugs become less and less until you get to your your effective treatment and this is a very very typical it&amp;#39;s not just fa along the way there&amp;#39;s going to be some failures they are going to be a lot of attrition and this is expected uh but the important thing that I want to point out to you is that at each stage all this different activities in each stage are or they all learning opportunity for opportunities for us so what&amp;#39;s important to point out is that all these different moments where you you seem to have a little step back these are learning opportunity we&amp;#39;ll always learn from these setbacks and you know at every stage of this development um it seems like you we&amp;#39;re making very small progress this very incremental um progress but but if you take it all together this is a very important all all this incremental um learning is very important to get to us to the finish line which is a treatment for fa so what can we do to uh try to help this this process the the drug development process there are a lot of things that Farah can do and does um and in all these different phases first of all we fund basic research we try to understand the disease as much as we can we try to identify all those Pathways that are targetable by drugs and we try to get as many as do as possible because as I mentioned earlier there&amp;#39;s going to be attrition um then we support preclinical development by mostly by try to um develop better tools for academic investigators for drug development developers to test these drugs and we support also clinical development devel development clinical trials by also trying to develop tools that are important for clinical development like biomarkers or trying to understand the disease the clinical clinical aspects of the disease through the natural the Natural History studies and then we take all this information and we engage with uh the FDA with Regulators to educate them about the disease and about the tools that we have available to develop drugs so getting into a little bit more detail of what we fund as far as um basic reearch research is concerned you&amp;#39;ve seen this depicted earlier how we like to um to um represent the disease as a process that goes from the mutation that you have in in in the DNA inside the cells the GAA repeat expansion in the fxn gene this causes the gene to be silenced this causes the low levels of uh ferin protein inside the cell and this has a lot of different consequences uh inside the cell some of which we know for example mitochondrial dysfunction or oxidative stress um these dysfunction causes the cell not to function well and sometimes to degenerate and obviously when a cell within a tissue doesn&amp;#39;t work properly or degenerate you have also tissue at the um dysfunction at the tissue level at the organ level and this translate into symptoms that all the um the fa patients experienc so this is what we know about the disease generally but we need to know every what happens at every single step and we need to learn as much as possible about all these different steps because every single step is a therapeutic opportunity so what are the outstanding questions uh in all these different steps that corre ciz the disease how does the GAA the expansion occur we still don&amp;#39;t have a clear answer there how are is the GAA um silencing the gene once once again something that we still we have some answer but not all the answers um what is the function of rxin we know that one of the function of AR taxin the main function as far as we know now is to produce this iron suoc cluster that are co-actors important for a lot of enzymes inside the cells but we now know that there might be other function of fraxin so what are these other functions um then what are all the consequence that uh when fxing is lost what are the consequence inside the cells um and what causes the dysfunction or the cell death once fexin is lost for example one important question that we have is why are only certain uh cell types affected why are only heart cells and brain cells affected and not skin cells or blood cells um another important question is what happens at the at the organ levels what happens to the brain what happened to the heart and are there um developmental components of the disease so are there changes in the disease for example in the brain that uh happens even before um a person is born and finally we don&amp;#39;t know a lot about some of the symptoms for example fatigue um a very important symptoms for for faers but we don&amp;#39;t know why fers experience fatigue what are the molecular mechanism behind fatigue and we don&amp;#39;t even know exactly how to measure it and these are some of the examples of grants that we have funded in the last few months that try to address all these questions and as you can see there we try to address every single one as much as possible to cover all the different questions as much as possible we have grants from um investigators for example under nuis week at at D ni who&amp;#39;s trying to find out why the GAA repeats are expanding he has a method to uh visualize the repeat inside the cells and is trying to use that to understand more about why the repeats are getting longer and longer um then we have grants that tackle the uh silencing San bandani is one of the expert in FA who&amp;#39;s looking at um gene silencing her grad student Morgan tacket as a grant to to elucidate that um and then we have other grants that tackle um the function of for taxing and Angela xong at at Boston College she is another GR student who&amp;#39;s looking at um what proteins are changing in the cell when fraxin is changing so what other protein besides fxing are affected by fxing LW and then Don Joseph at chop is looking at brain circuits what happens to the brain connectivity uh how the neurons connect to each other when fexin is low um Lucy hamt is with um Helen poo um in France and she&amp;#39;s looking at that last question one of the last question that I mentioned are there neurodevelopmental changes in FAA together with neurodegenerative changes and how does that affect the disease preclinical research what do we do about um developing those tools for preclinical research um we try to develop cell models um and this is an area where your contribution was fundamental because you the one who gave those skin biopsies and our our um investigators found a way to transform those skin biopsies into stem cells and from those stem cells we can make uh the uh cells that are more affected in in FAA heart cells brain cells that then investigator can use to study the disease they can also not only make the cells but they can also make like human tissue or human organ in a in a tissue they called organoids mini heart mini brains in a dish where they that they can use to to test uh drugs and also animal models as I said um we need animal models to to test whether a drug um is um has some efficacy and whether a drug is safe before we can put it in into a person and and then we we can we also um uh fund the development of some essays like a potency essay for drugs these are three very good example of grants that we have funded in the last month or so um from Three Investigators on developing those tools Esther back at the University of Oxford she&amp;#39;s making those mini brains actually she&amp;#39;s making mini Cal in a dish to test drugs and study what happens in the cerebellum uh in the human cerebellum um in vitro in a in a tube um shanon boy at University of Florida she&amp;#39;s making a new mouse model for FAA specifically a mouse model of vision loss in FAA because she wants to um to test a therapy a gin therapy for vision loss and Rob Wilson is making a fish model of a fa I know it&amp;#39;s a little bit weird but sometimes we need to um we need to use different animals different animal models to recapitulate all the different aspects of a fa fa is a very complex disease there are mul multi-tissue M multiple tissues that are affected and sometimes using mice is not enough and we need a different animal to test what we cannot recapitulate in uh in mice obviously animals are not people so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s hard that find the one model that represents fa fully and finally um what do we f as far as you know helping clinical research helping clinical trials um biomarker uh development is is you know an important aspect we try to fund uh research that develops new biomarkers for fa you probably all have heard about track FAA this big study International stud that um uh follows measures the the brain and the spinal cord in people with a fa over time to try to see if that represents the progression of the disease and and maybe see if that measure can be used in clinical trial to test if a if a drug is effective or not and that&amp;#39;s a biomarker and the natural history study once again this is a this is a part of research where your contribution is ESS Central as Jen mentioned earlier um our the clinical um the natural history study is now uh being the F the uh us nation natural history study is now being um um unified with that&amp;#39;s the name of the study uh with the um uh European natural history study so the the new uh study is going to be called unify um and uh it&amp;#39;s going to be run through a International um Consortium of centers that is the FCC and you see over oops didn&amp;#39;t mean to do that but you see over here all the centers all over the world that are involved in this um in this multinational study um examples of um uh grants that tackle all those question biomarkers uh and um some of the measure the outcome measures that we can um um utilize in clinical trials um the first one is a collaboration between a Brazilian um researcher and um um an investigators in Australia and in this case uh these investigator are investigators are trying to use AI artificial intelligence to develop uh an automated method to read MRI scans of people of cerebell of people um Eric W and sub subani at the University of Florida are trying to develop a tool to measure F taxin directly in the um cereal spinal um fluid of people um and they think this this could be a way to um determine whether F taxin changes in the ceros spinal fluid also represent changes that occur in the brain and finally Louis Corbin this is another grand that was funded in the last year or so she&amp;#39;s trying to find measures that are useful for Pediatric trials you&amp;#39;ve heard I mean you&amp;#39;re all interested in um in uh when uh pediatric trials are are um um are going to be when trials that that apply to children will be are going to be available for CH to Children um and but it&amp;#39;s important to have tools that we can use for children and right now we have for example as uh a measure of clinical outcome the M fars but we don&amp;#39;t know if the M fars is as useful for children as it is in adults because it measure some of the activities that uh are still developing in children like gate for example and so um we need specific tools for younger um younger faers and also we fund some of uh very early drug development efforts um late stages we we leave to the to the drug developments biotech and pharmaceutical companies but um we also like to fund very early stage uh drug development and um these are some of the examples Bernard d d and Javier Santos in France and in Argentina are trying to find drugs that can substitute for fraxin function in the cell and also we found um some uh proposals that are looking at drugs that are being developed in other diseases uh for example uh DMD Duan uh to treat the heart for example um and this investigator think that these drugs can be potentially applied to fa can be efficacious also in fa uh and so so we trying to we fund them to um provide evidence that these drugs are indeed a good could potentially be good drug for fa as well and so this is you know the sum of all the research effort uh of um that uh far has funded over the years of course the approval of omv is one of them you&amp;#39;ve heard from Jen that a Farah funded the foundational science that allow uh for a rational to use omav in in FA um and our our treatment pipeline uh that represents uh where all the um funding effort um from Farah funding research basic research some kind of um translational research uh went and this is the result of it um and what I oops I wanted to if you if we go back to uh that our presentation of the disease as a process um our ultimate goal is to understand these different steps and to um and as I mentioned earlier all these different steps are therapeutic opportunity so we want to fill all these boxes for these different steps with as many um approaches therapeutic Avenues as possible um so that&amp;#39;s my intro and I wanted to introduce to you now they are fair fellows these are um well were supposed to be four but unfortunately Chan Fang is is sick so it&amp;#39;s just three of them but these are um young investigators who have dedicated their early careers to studying fa um we um we give an an award this is the first year that we give this award the farra fellow award that um allows them to um to uh interact with with other investigators with more senior investigators kind of raise their profile a little bit help their career um and also uh participate to um conferences research conferences or also conference like this one where they can interact with um with the patient community so I&amp;#39;ll in introduce the first speaker is suj Chandra she is at Stanford and she&amp;#39;s going to talk about a little bit of her research okay hi everyone my name is suoi I am a postar at Stanford in Dr shinan wangs lab um so the main focus of my research is uh the cellular or molecular basis of fa with the aim to identify mitochondrial Pathways that that are altered in pexia patients and that can be targeted using small molecule drugs so I um use these fa induced PL poent stem cils or ipscs that are generated by genetically reprogramming the skin cells that uh that are derived from patients and we also then edit them to get an isogenic control ibscs and then I further differentiate them into Sensory neurons and cardiomyocytes which are the most uh as we know are the two most important types of cells that are affected in fa so using these two model from the same uh patient derived ipscs I am conducting a global uh unbiased proteomic study uh to identify proteins that are altered in FA patients compared to the control and also to see if these Pathways mitochondrial Pathways and the proteins are cell type specific so I will just uh show you uh just briefly uh the models that I have uh generated in the lab so on the the left you can see the sensory neurons that I have differentiated from ipscs so it takes about a month to uh differentiate them so I first generate these neural cresles that you see uh in a that are um that expresses so 10 then I further differentiate them into Sensory neurons and uh these Sensory neurons are also proprioceptive and they express per valine and peripherin and all the other markers um on the right you can can see a cardiomyo side model that I have developed so uh it&amp;#39;s very cool uh for me to see that these cells actually beat in the culture after you uh successfully cultured them for a certain time uh so yeah I&amp;#39;m just using these two models from the same patient and conducting a few uh promic studies um uh and then I just wanted to briefly talk about another U um focus of my research so here we are targeting uh the oxidative stress in fa uh as um I think Barbara and uh some of the other speakers in the morning they discussed uh oxidative stress is a very prominent feature of fa and we want to Target it by using a molecule called we we call it MR3 that our lab has already discovered and tested in a Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease model so we are targeting this pathway called The Mix 60 Miro one pathway my it&amp;#39;s the mitochondrial pathway so uh the protein Meo one is actually a outer mitochondrial membrane protein uh so what it does it it helps the mitochondria to move on the microtubules inside the cell and also when this meor protein is removed from the surface of the mitochondria that acts as a signal for those damaged mitochondria to be uh degraded by mitophagy so uh removal of Meo is sort of a way for the cells to ensure that it is only keeping functioning functioning healthy mitochondria and it is degrading the damaged ones so uh in FA or in PD when there is high level of reactive oxygen species present in the cell what happens is it causes a confirmational change of a pro of a inner mitochondrial membrane protein called mix 60 which then further binds more Miro protein and stabilizes the complex so since there are more Meo present on the damage mitochondria they can no longer be uh degraded by mitophagy so what happens is there are more damaged mitochondria that keeps accumulating in the neurons and the kyom myoides and further causes death of those cells so I am using um using the two models I described I am using uh this miror reducer 3 compound that our lab has to see if it has any beneficial effects on both of these models um that&amp;#39;s a brief overview of what I&amp;#39;m doing and I would like to thank far for uh inviting us to participate here and uh our lab is at Stanford and uh thank you so much for your time okay we we&amp;#39;ll take question at the end so I&amp;#39;m going to uh ask Shan Guan she&amp;#39;s at Colombia hello everyone my name is shaan I come from Columbia University uh I&amp;#39;m very happy to be here to share my research progress in FA and also very happy to hear your question your stories so I&amp;#39;ll give you brief introduction on my project my mentor is Dr Sean Neil here he is and our live focus on using multiple IP genetic editing tool to rescue the this after having this you must have question what is epig gentic editing tool let&amp;#39;s see this picture you could see my pointer the green one so the blue color the double strand Helix curl line that is our DNA is the carrier of our genetic information what is genetic information it&amp;#39;s include like your skin color or you like the case of P or will you be allergic to diarhea or some other food that&amp;#39;s a genetic level except the D you can see there are also some modification on the D like the orange one here we call it&amp;#39;s D mulation and also there are prople Circle that&amp;#39;s a hone which is used for DNA to WRA on it make the DNA very condense because you we strange our DNA to a straight line it will be 2 meter I say very small right so to make sure our cell can hold this long DNA it should be very complex kind like WRA on this hisone you can you can see in the hisone there are little tail and there are some chemical group on it it also uh can regulate this kind of DNA function this kind of modification can record our life Behavior like how many XI you did every week what kind of food you eat also can record your environment so this kind epigenetic uh information is is won&amp;#39;t affect our D sequence it&amp;#39;s just a modification of the DNA but it can affect D&amp;#39;s function for example it can regulate the Gene&amp;#39;s function you is not correct it may cause some disease so the main character of the epigenetic is rible which mean we can rewrite this kind of epigenetic information for ourself how to cheve this to CH this go our lab develop a Chris C9 based on tool which we call Ig gentic Iden tool Chris pro9 is a very fancy technology in the U modern science uh field and it&amp;#39;s won the Nobel Prize in 2020 uh because of the limitation of time I want to introduce more you you have interest uh we can talk later and our lab adapt this tool to fion with some writer or eraser or our or the Imp IG gentic information so that we can CH write some information there all also remove some information for example we we can add the with some like this orange uh modification like we can consider as a hat for the DNA also you can say the one in the purple one we can consider as a scarf for the DNA sequence our lab have successfully appli this kind of adding tool to very specific and also very accurate to edit our epigenetic information especially in patient then we can correct it to a health condition we have apply this tool in multiple disease like red syndrome and also file X syndrome then how we apply it to fragile te taxia so as you may already know in the genetic level the fral txia was called by the mutation in the gene FX is a repeat region or expanded that&amp;#39;s where let the uh genes product the FR taxin from in the patient uh cells the product level very low except the genetic level we also check the epigenetic level for example in the left side is the epigenetic modification in patient and the right side is the house people&amp;#39;s epigenetic information for example you say DM mulation level you can in the DNA in the patient it have little hat that we call D mulation modification it just some chemical group but in the house people we don&amp;#39;t have this hat on your DNA and also we can say in the hone level there are some scarf we call hone estation in the health people but we couldn&amp;#39;t find this kind of modification couldn&amp;#39;t find the scarf in the patient cells so here is our question is this IG Genet difference will affect the fragen test you we can rewrite this EP gen information could we rescue this disease so we have a test in the cells so for the DM solution to remove the head from DNA we have to which name a Dean T you don&amp;#39;t need to remember this complex uh scientific term you just remember it&amp;#39;s a eraser of your or head or the DNA sequence and they also we have specific tool to add a scarf on the histone we call it DCP F1 p300 you just remember it&amp;#39;s a writer or the scarf to your DNA so we apply this tool in the uh fral taia patient derived ipsa uh here I want really want to appreciate uh our patient donate this for for the research it&amp;#39;s really helpful and also we uh first we successfully edit the ipsa we then we evaluate after this kind of edit did it rescue the expression level of fexin because that&amp;#39;s a very important Gene for for the fragen tesia also we want to evaluate after this kind editing where the cells function like the mitochondria function or also the neurons activity was really rescued or not here is some our very preliminary data you can say let&amp;#39;s say the first uh first bar on the left there are three bar the very L one is our goal that&amp;#39;s house people&amp;#39;s effect sense expression level the middle bar is the patient expression level so we know where we show the m to then let&amp;#39;s see how our tools works you can see the very right bar that&amp;#39;s our uh DNA mulation edting tool which to remove the head from the DNA sequence you can see it increase a little bit like roughly 1.7 for Change and also we use other tool to add the SC to your hone uh we use it both in ipsc also in the neuron cell we can s roughly twofold increase we are very exciting to solve this result because that mean dation hist modification this can EP genetic information is did involved in the fragen testas progress and we can use our tool to rill this kind of disease meanwhile we also noted there still some space we can improve control to make our tool works better to rescue the ex PR level more higher to chill the health controls group uh in the future we are trying to first we are trying to optimize this tool meanwhile you can see the different tool for example add the scarf or remove the Hat both works but how about you we more them together well it&amp;#39;s both resue efficiency we are trying on that SC so last but not least I want to pre is the fal spot to our study and I also want to preure our excellent collaborator professor jini and her team at columia University and also I want to pess our L member uh here oh sorry this all our L thank you thank you so much all right let me advance sorry I&amp;#39;m not qualified to give this presentation oh here it is all right so next is PU Yogo is from UT Southwest University of Texas thank you it&amp;#39;s a big deal to speak uh after a great scientist like my co- fellow and I will try anyway okay I&amp;#39;m glad to present my project using antisense oligonucleotide against fa what is antisense oligonucleotide AO it&amp;#39;s uh this green piece one it&amp;#39;s a short nuclear acid molecule that can be used to Target specific region of a and through this mechanism they can inhib or increase gen expression and because they can mod at the level of the protein that are used as drug and the action require high complimentarity with the target seconds makes them more specific compared to the conventional drugs also by chemical modification we can increase the stability and some may be administrated just two or three times a years this kind of drug can be quickly developed and can be specified for patient with rare ation and for all this reason uh this approach has developed to have a Innovative drugs against cancers and genetic disease and the USA FDA approved some encouraging the initiation of new project my job is to investigate a therapeutic approach for fa using anti-sense oligo nucleotide how yam lab as a uh reported the presence of aan M in the cells of the patient with J expansion and this aberant uh mRNA is named here fraxin ET and during the transcription of the frataxin Gen we have also this Aban one who can decrease the level of the normal frine so we hypothesize that it&amp;#39;s possible to use Azo to decrease his level and increase the level of the normal M by using anti hcle to block the S Exon how it work after the transcription we have the prea with the Exon and the Antron and this praya need to be sped into the Mata and we can use use AO to Target the prea and disrupting the reconnection by displacing factors so instead to have two mRNA if we target the SP Mna we will have only a normal one a single one and to test the feasibility of our approach we design an AO targeting a normal Mr and we observe a reduction of this Mr in uh the cells of patient providing proof that it&amp;#39;s possible to use this approach to reduce Mr on frine gen currently uh I am testing around 15 AO targeting principally the SED Exon to decrease his level in the patient hoping to have the best one for future therapeutic I current to my experiment on passan fa blast NPCs before the ultimate uh on most model brain this will be uh my little contribution to our Victory against fa my name is PU yo I am in Dr Mara lab as a post do may receive his greeting thank you Farah for your support thank you everyone great thank you um are there any questions for regarding research funding or to our very talented young investigators regarding their projects or um maybe we can start by you told us a little bit about yourself um how did you end up working on fa start um yeah so uh I am a fifth uh fifth year post actually but my PhD training and also my uh first postar at UCLA both were on Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease and Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease and when I joined uh Dr W&amp;#39;s Lab at Stanford we had uh just received a grant from far and since Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease and uh Fredrick&amp;#39;s attacks are share a lot of common phenotypes like the accumulation of iron calcium imbalances and just both uh both have really prominent mitochondrial uh uh phenotypes uh so I ended up working uh for Frederick saaia uh right now I am the uh only person in our lab that is working on fa and I&amp;#39;m very excited to uh you know develop all these uh models and really thanks to uh you guys for providing us with all the uh skin cells and everything that we can um engineer to um get many very important cell types that really helps our research yeah thank you say something hi um actually I&amp;#39;m person totally in a different field before I start the fragen tax project I&amp;#39;m in the epig gentic field to say how this epig genetic in fact information affect our health and disease our lab focus on multiple brain disease as I mentioned earlier like Str syndrome and also the fragile X syndrome as you may know lot of brain disease associated with this kind of repeat expandation so it&amp;#39;s very in to understand why all the brain disease most of brain disease social this kind the mutation right and also our collaborator Journey share the sh in the fragen TF and they found each other to say how about we apply this epet adding tool in the fragen taxia because we have some very successfully example in other disease so that&amp;#39;s why how I started this project yeah thank you I came from Bina fasu to Canada only to learn molecular biology and during this PhD my topic was on fa with Dr Jac Petr in Laval University and I use uh chrisper C9 to delete the GAA repeat and during my PhD I have contact with the patient for example I saw the patient making the tour of soraa river to raise money for research that touch me and I decided to continue in this way if I have opportunity and M give me the opportunity to come his LA and to be a post do so I am very glad to contribute for something in this disease thank you yeah timeline yeah so uh we uh just it really depends on um uh how fast we can for at least for me how fast we can get the cells that we need for our uh different experiments so right now I am uh working with these two models the sensory neuron and the cardiomyocytes which takes about one month to just get one round of differentiation done so it&amp;#39;s definitely a little time consuming but uh yeah we are hoping to finish this in the next uh one year or so because uh that will be my end of post talk also hopefully at Stanford so yeah we are hoping we are already done with uh one of our proteomic screen in the sensory neurons so we hope to see very um exciting data from there and we will move for forward with that yeah uh I start this project from one years ago uh as you may know this kind of tour is very specific to specific Gene you can design whatever Gene you can Target so we Design This into this specific FX engine and apply it to ipsc and also apply to neuron which is our final goal it&amp;#39;s uh the data I show here kind like one year&amp;#39;s work and in the future first side will keep on working on this model to make it works better meanwhile we also try to apply to the mouse expent to see well it&amp;#39;s working in wable condition then it&amp;#39;s more close to the clinical treatment so uh hard for me to give the ex exactly time like when could we successfully successfully CH this goals but we are working at it and hopefully we can have some clinical application as soon as possible thank you I am a three Monon postdoc researcher and uh uh for my project to inv vitro until invivo we playing for two or three years but during this period we will also do another thing like uh the patient with point mutation we also want to use AO to uh try to find a therapeutic thank you so so first I want to congratulate everyone um because you have some really great science and really um proposing some really great um experiments I had a specific question for uh Johan about your uh crisper strategy on the timeline the initro timeline you presented um you&amp;#39;re going to perform the editing at the ipsc stage before differentiation yes is there a plan um or is it possible to try this strategy after the cells have been uh fully differentiated into their uh Target adult cell type yeah definitely uh first we are try on the ipsa is kind of like stem cell of the the the the the fragen taxia patient stem cell so after way we can choose this kind of editing in the stem cell later we can always differentiate this this cell to like neurons or the heart cells which is we really want to Cho this kind of editing and the other side we also trying to directly edit in the you know differential cell like neuron cell and heart cell that&amp;#39;s more close to the clinical uh uh application that&amp;#39;s what we are working on yeah thank you anybody else if not I just want to thank again these wonderful young investigators they&amp;#39;re so talented thank you so much for working on",

    "transcript": "okay so hi everyone today we&amp;#39;re going to be continuing our discussion on inherited ataxias so our last class was on an autosomal dominant inherited attacks here that is spinose cerebellar ataxias today is going to be an autosomal recessive inherited ataxia which is very very important for the exam that is friedrichs ataxia so as i had mentioned my earlier video i&amp;#39;ve uploaded all my notes on this app called neuraxis pro which is available on google play store and also uh on also in the app store under my institute so i put the link and the code in the description so you can go ahead and access my notes over there i have posted notes for all the videos i&amp;#39;ve taken till date on this channel okay now let&amp;#39;s go into the class so friday&amp;#39;s ataxia is the most common inherited ataxia okay if it comprises the 50 percent of all inherited attacks here so it&amp;#39;s a very very important mcq point so what is the most common inherited ataxia it is friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia now compared to the genetics so as we discussed earlier it is an autosomal recessive inheritance in contrast to spinous circular ataxias and episodic ataxias which have an auto autosomal dominant inheritance okay so coming to the classical form okay the classical form is due to mutation the frataxin gene which is present on chromosome 9 i think most of us are acquainted with this so frataxin is a mitochondrial protein so frataxin is a mitochondrial protein which is very very important for iron homeostasis so what happens is in friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia there&amp;#39;s going to be decrease in expression of this for taxing gene product so the patient is going to have increased intracellular accumulation of iron which leads on to irreversible cell injury so that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on in the cellular level in this ataxia and just like spinosaurus ataxias it is a trinucleotide repeat disorder but here the trinucleotide that is repeated is gaa very very important question so we have gaa trinuted repeats in the first intron so normal people are going to have 7 to 22 repeats whereas in friedreich&amp;#39;s attack say the patients are going to have 200 to 900 repeats so don&amp;#39;t forget gaa and don&amp;#39;t forget autosomal recessive and fritoxin okay now coming to the other rare genetic causes of friedreich&amp;#39;s attacks here so these two are because of vitamin e deficiency so these genetic variants are going to cause friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia by causing vitamin e deficiency so now let&amp;#39;s look into them so we have a beta lipoproteinemia which is also known as base and convex syndrome so here there is a mutation in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein okay so as you know vldl is formed and secreted from the liver and vldl is what is going to carry vitamin e so because there is mutation in the mtp there is going to be impaired formation and secretion of vldl from the liver and because of this vitamin e is not going to reach the peripheral tissues it&amp;#39;s not going to reach the peripheral tissues so this is what&amp;#39;s happening in a beta lipoproteinemia the other genetic variant is ataxia with vitamin e deficiency that is avid this is because of mutation in the alpha tocopherol transfer protein okay so for vitamin e to bind to vldl you require this alpha tocopherol transfer protein so since this is mutated over here and it&amp;#39;s not working vitamin e cannot bind to vldl so again causing deficiency of vitamin e in the peripheral tissues so these are the two important rare genetic variants of friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia that you have to remember don&amp;#39;t forget a beta lipoprotonemia okay now coming to the neural pathology so the primary sides of involvement over here are going to be the spinal cord the dorsal root ganglion and the peripheral nerves so in spinal cord you&amp;#39;re going to have involvement of the spinocerebolatrax the lateral corticospinal tracts and the posterior columns and remember one of the earliest structures structures to be involved in fritos ataxia is dorsal root ganglion very very important mcq question and you&amp;#39;re going to have a large fiber peripheral large fiber neuropathy because preferentially the large myelinated fibers are involved over here and surprisingly the involvement of the cerebellum and cerebral cortex is very minimal the only only patient is going to have only slight atrophy of the cerebellum cerebral cortex remember here the main pathology is going to be in the spinal cord the spinal cord the peripheral nerves and the dorsal root ganglia okay very very important cardiac pathology so 90 percent of the friedreich&amp;#39;s taxi patients are going to have cardiac involvement and this most commonly takes the form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy so you can also have dilated cardiomyopathy in friedex attacks here but the most common type is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy so you&amp;#39;re going to have myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis sub interval or medial deposition of periodic acid shift positive material and myocytopathy with unusual pleomorphic nuclei so just don&amp;#39;t forget this point myocyte hypertrophy very very important now coming to the clinical features so the age of onset inflated certaxia is usually less than 25 years and the median age of death is going to be 35 years and don&amp;#39;t forget the most common cause of death over here is cardiac so cardiac causes are the most common cause of discovery here very very important mcq don&amp;#39;t forget this and females have a better prognosis than male patients so we&amp;#39;ll discuss the clinical features under neurological manifestations and extra neurological manifestations so come to the neurological manifestations so because of spinous cerebral attract involvement you&amp;#39;re going to have progressive ataxi gait frequent false truncal determination and remember your lower limbs are going to be involved more than an upper limbs then nystagmus loss of fast circuits another another features of cerebral dysfunction like dysarthria dysmetria a taxi of the trunk and limb moments all because of spinal cord attack involvement and very very important don&amp;#39;t forget this the patient is going to have an extensor plantar with loss of deep tendon reflexes so you can have an extensor plantar because of pyramidal involvement so the patient&amp;#39;s corticospinal tracts are going to get involved so because of this you&amp;#39;re going to get a babinski positive or an extensor planter and loss of deep neuron reflexes is because of peripheral neuropathy is because of peripheral neuropathy see what is the other important neurological condition where you get this babinski positive with absent deep neural reflexes it is subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord that is seen in vitamin b12 deficiency okay so this is very very important exam point and also you can have weakness because of pyramidal involvement where the distal muscles are going to involve it don&amp;#39;t get involved more than the proximal muscles loss of vibratory sense and proper reception because of posterior column involvement and a mild to moderate mental retardation and other psychiatric issues and don&amp;#39;t forget optical trophy this is again an important mcq point optical trophy will also be present in friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia and the patient can also have some degree of hearing loss now coming to the manifestations which are extra neurological manifestations so cardiac manifestations as we discussed earlier 90 percent of the patients are going to have this so the most common so you ask an mcq what is the type of cardiomyopathy seen in friction ataxia it&amp;#39;s going to be hypertrophic cardiomyopathy so don&amp;#39;t forget this point you can also have conduction defects patient can also have atrial fibrillation okay so these are important cardiac manifestations endocrine manifestations 20 percent of the patients are going to have diabetes mellitus is because of both insulin resistance as well as beta cell dysfunction okay now coming to the musculoskeletal deformities patients are going to have pescabas best equinovirus and scoliosis so we discussed the genetic variance of friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia so now let&amp;#39;s look into the clinical variance of frederick&amp;#39;s attacks so as you know friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia is usually going to present less than 25 years usually in early adolescence but in case it&amp;#39;s going to present after 25 years as it does so in 15 percent of the cases it&amp;#39;s known as lofa that is late onset free text attacks here and in case the patient so as you know patients are going to have loss of deep terminal reflexes so the patient&amp;#39;s having normal or exaggerated deep tendon reflexes it&amp;#39;s known as far that is friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia with the retained reflexes so these are important clinical variants that you have to remember for the exam okay now how we are going to diagnose fruitrix attacks here so it&amp;#39;s a clinical diagnosis so mainly going to confirm the diagnosis only by genetic testing and if you happen to take an mra remember your cerebellum is going to be normal relatively normal there&amp;#39;s not going to be any abnormalities in the cerebellum your main pathology is in the spinal cord dorsal root ganglia and the peripheral nerves so in mre you&amp;#39;re going to see predominant spinal cord atrophy very very important one be more specific the upper cervical cord is going to be atrophied okay now commit to the treatment so like for any other inherited ataxia there&amp;#39;s no breakthrough treatment or any treatment that is going to change the course of the disease or improve the neurological manifestations but for friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia unlike for spinosaurus attacks we do have a few drugs so for the exam don&amp;#39;t forget this name it is idb known it&amp;#39;s a free radical scavenger it&amp;#39;s given at a dose of 5 mg per kg per day but remember it does not help with the neurological issues okay it only improves the myocardial hypertrophy and the main side effects are going to be gi side effects so don&amp;#39;t remember don&amp;#39;t forget to remember id belong very very important for frederick&amp;#39;s attacks here okay next alpha alpha tocopherol quinone so this can cause a dose dependent improvement in the neurological symptoms and this is especially useful in the rare genetic variants of friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia which are due to vitamin e deficiency okay that is a beta lipoproteinemia and ataxia with vitamin deficiency and remember iron chelators and antioxidant drugs are potentially harmful they can actually increase myocyte injury okay so they&amp;#39;re best avoided and like for any other inhibited ataxia your mainstay of treatment is going to be supportive therapy okay so i think i&amp;#39;ve covered most of the important points thank you",

    "transcript": "for our final video we&amp;#39;re going to be looking at different strategies that researchers have taken to look at gene-based therapies for fragrance ataxia well none of these therapies are currently available for treatment of patients there&amp;#39;s been progress made on multiple different avenues to look at different things that might be helpful given what we&amp;#39;ve learned so far about how we go from the error in the dna to the lack of the protein to the symptoms that patients have the first of these topics we&amp;#39;re going to go over is called adeno-associated virus also aav for short all we really need to know about this is that there are different types of viruses that exist throughout the world and many of them work by entering cells and leaving their own dna in there hijacking the cell&amp;#39;s own systems in order to replicate the virus itself well researchers did something smart and said that if the virus can hijack our systems maybe we can hijack the viruses in order to use it for our own purposes let&amp;#39;s take a look at what would normally happen in nature let&amp;#39;s say this aav the virus comes in and it&amp;#39;s going to enter a normal cell in the human body and leave a copy of its own dna in the cell&amp;#39;s nucleus which is the area that the cells the cell stores its own dna in order to keep those blueprints there in order to have the instructions to make all those proteins well when the virus leaves its own dna there it&amp;#39;s essentially hijacking the systems that the cell uses to use the dna as a blueprint so our own infrastructure in the cell is going to look at the virus dna and say hey we&amp;#39;ll follow out those instructions and make whatever you want in that case it can make more copies of the virus or other proteins that the virus wants to make essentially takes over what the cell would normally do instead uses it for its own purposes but what some very clever scientists figured out they could do is that they can alter the dna that&amp;#39;s in the virus shell in order to use it as a vector to insert what we want to into a cell instead remember that in free drinks ataxia the problem is that you don&amp;#39;t have a proper functioning copy of that fxn gene so you&amp;#39;re not making the right protein well what if we take this virus here and instead of having virus dna in it we create a normal copy of the fxn gene in it and allow the virus to do its job of bringing that copy of the gene into the cell and leaving a new fxng in that case even if our own copies of the fxn gene aren&amp;#39;t working properly the new one that we&amp;#39;ve just added to it will and as a result even though before we weren&amp;#39;t making the proper frataxin protein that&amp;#39;s going to do its job and prevent freedox ataxia now we&amp;#39;ve inserted this new copy of the gene and it&amp;#39;s just going to hang out in the cell&amp;#39;s nucleus and do its job for us in fact they&amp;#39;ve already did a study as far back as 2014 where they added the fxn gene to this virus and transplanted into mice that had basically an equivalent of friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia and they found that these mice did in fact go on to produce larger amounts of this for tax and protein it was a good proof of concept um in essence and the strategy hasn&amp;#39;t just been used for freedox ataxia so far it&amp;#39;s actually been used for a disease called sma or spinal muscle atrophy in fact they&amp;#39;ve gone so far for that that there&amp;#39;s a medication already out in use for it having said all this this isn&amp;#39;t a system that&amp;#39;s hundred percent perfect yet or particularly ready to use it for your ataxia there are risks that are associated with it and while research is continuing we have to be in keep in mind things like you have a reaction whenever you use a virus in this manner your body recognizes virus shells and it&amp;#39;s not uncommon for individuals to have a reaction to that it&amp;#39;s known for causing liver inflammation there&amp;#39;s also always a risk that what if we implant too much of that dna and we end up making too much many copies of a protein for example it&amp;#39;s known that if you give too much for toxin to somebody it can actually have negative side effects we kind of want that goldilocks zone so it can be hard to dial in the exact amount of the dna that you give to somebody finally we have to consider cost unfortunately a lot of these genetic treatments while they have the potential to be highly efficacious and maybe even curative they also tend to be really expensive because a lot of research has to be done and the equipment involved is not cheap for example the medication that&amp;#39;s used for sma costs over two million dollars for a single use having said that as far as we know currently you only need to give a single use of it as opposed to taking a pill every day for the rest of your life so clearly there&amp;#39;s a lot of advantages and disadvantages to this type of system we&amp;#39;re going to be taking a look at another one right now for our next subject i want to talk a little bit about crispr cas9 this is something that you may have heard about in the general press it got a nobel prize for its research and discovery not that long ago and it has a lot of promise for future treatment of friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia and there&amp;#39;s been some studies involved with it so far but let&amp;#39;s learn a little bit about what it is before we go into exactly how it might be used to help treat or cure freezer&amp;#39;s ataxia okay crispr stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats we don&amp;#39;t need to worry about too much about what that actually means and we&amp;#39;re just going to call it crispr from now on because that&amp;#39;s a mouthful but essentially it&amp;#39;s a portion of a bacteria dna that it uses as a record or a library for its immune defense against viruses we often think of viruses going after people or other animals but they can go after bacteria too bacteria are small but viruses are even smaller and certain types of viruses like to inject their dna into a bacteria in order to hijack that bacteria system well bacteria over millions of years have developed ways to defend themselves against this system using this library in their own dna they&amp;#39;ve created a defense system where they remember previous types of viruses that have attacked them keep a record inside this repeating segment here and then use proteins with this record in order to attack the virus dna let&amp;#39;s look at that a little bit more carefully those virus dna is coming inside the bacteria we have this cas9 protein which is this defensive protein there&amp;#39;s lots of different types of cast proteins we&amp;#39;re really just going to focus on cas9 what cas9 does is it can use a record of previous attacks from viruses in order to have a matching segment in itself that will recognize new virus dna that comes in and says aha i&amp;#39;ve seen your type before i&amp;#39;m going to go up and basically chew you up why that&amp;#39;s useful for us is because casino protein has a way in order to snip dna which we&amp;#39;ll see is going to be important for how we can use that to affect faulty genes like an error in friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia so that we might be able to make changes in that next we&amp;#39;re going to go over how scientists have affected crispr casini in order to use it for our own purposes okay so now we know about this crispr cas9 system a little bit how does it actually help us particularly in regards to fragrance ataxia where we know that the main problem is that in that fxn gene we have too long of a um repeat of this g-a-a-g-a-a over and over again in the dna&amp;#39;s code well we know that crispr and cast 9 is a system that allows cas9 to have a guide segment to identify specific portions of the dna segment well if we know exactly what we&amp;#39;re looking for with our fxn gene we can modify the cas90 protein to have this guide segment locate to the specific part of our dna sequence that we want to all right so let&amp;#39;s say that this dna sequence right here is in fact our fxn gene and we&amp;#39;ve created a guide segment that can go and locate to exactly where we want it to all right now cast nine is going to go down we already talked about how it&amp;#39;s good at making cuts in dna and it makes a cut all right normally when your dna has a cut like this your body and your cell recognizes that that&amp;#39;s a problem and it tries to rejoin those parts together and that can cause a mutation sometimes or it can just come back to normal function it depends with crispr cast 9 however we could decide hey we&amp;#39;ve already made a cut here why not attach a new piece of information to the system and have some new dna we want to insert into this area that&amp;#39;s if we want to add some function to this system there are certain types of genetic diseases for example where instead of having too long of a system like in friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia we&amp;#39;re missing some crucial information which is why you might want to add the part of the blueprint and that new dna into the system that you want however in friedrichs ataxia what we really want to do is shorten these gaa repeats again and again and so instead of just making a single cut and then having it repair itself from the normal body system we can use this system to cut out a whole area of this portion of the dna that we don&amp;#39;t want so for your taxi as we recall is when that gaa repeat is instead of only a couple times happening it&amp;#39;s happening 90 to over a thousand times we try and cut out big pieces of that instead in order to shorten it and return our fxn gene to a more normal function so we can create more of that for taxing protein in fact there&amp;#39;s already been some studies in mice showing a proof of concept of this where they had mice with really long segments of these gaa proteins and they were able to cut out large segments of it in order to improve the amount of frataxin production however there&amp;#39;s one more problem with this when we talked about the aav that virus before that injected dna into cells that was relatively easy to get that dna into the place we want however in this case if you have a grown adult it might be hard to get all these changes into all the billions of cells that a person has all right so we&amp;#39;re going to have to talk about how we deliver this mechanism to the right cell we&amp;#39;re going to talk about that right now now that we&amp;#39;ve taken a look at how crispr can be used to modify dna we&amp;#39;re going to understand how we can actually get it to the place it needs to be and what&amp;#39;s already been done and what progress has been made in regards to friedrichs ataxia so to start off with we have to understand that the body is made up of billions of different cells from the neurons in our brain to the skin cells in our skin to all sorts of things and it can be a little bit difficult to implement crispr cas9 on all of these different cells in order to change that blueprint dna code so that we can make the protein that we need so that we can avoid the symptoms of friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia but we&amp;#39;ve found some ways around this at least in theory so far and we have had some promising studies in that effect to look at how we do this we&amp;#39;re going to talk a little bit about hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells these are cells that we have throughout our body but are particularly located within the marrow of our bones and are used as precursor cells that eventually become all types of different blood cells these hspcs can grow up and turn into different types of immune cells red blood cells platelets what have you let&amp;#39;s step back a bit what happens if we alter these hspcs so that we cut out that long gaa repeat well then hypothetically these hspcs should have the correct blueprints in the correct dna to make all the frataxin that we need but remember it&amp;#39;s really more of our nerve cells and our heart cells and other things that are having the problem so how does this help us if we fix these cells well let&amp;#39;s find out how so we&amp;#39;re going to take a needle or some other method to get a bunch of these hspcs and bring them to the lab once they&amp;#39;re in the lab we can just use it in petri dish or frankly probably a more complicated machine than that and use crispr in the lab on the hspcs and cut out all these gaa repeats therefore now our hspcs are going to have a proper copy of that fxn gene so we they can make all the frataxin they need all right what happens then well if then you inject these hspcs back into the body that they came from all of a sudden you have normal progenitor cells in there that are creating all the frataxin that those cells need that&amp;#39;s not enough yet because as we just talked about we need that for toxin in the right cells luckily there are certain types of blood cells that are known to share specifically these guys can grow up to become immune cells and keep going on until they become a type of immune cell called a macrophage macrophages actually connect to other types of cells in order to help them if those cells seem to be sick in particular they use a process called tunneling nanotubules which is a pretty cool name and they can use it to donate different things to other cells so let&amp;#39;s say this macrophage notices that a nerve cell certain type is not doing too great it can then create this tubule to connect it and donate some of its own parts in order to help that cell specifically that for taxin is in a part of the cell called the mitochondria and it&amp;#39;s not that it can even ship little parts of itself over to that other cell and then suddenly even though our nerve cell still has the faulty copies of that fxn gene it&amp;#39;s got donated versus from the macrophage and should be able to function much better so now we&amp;#39;ve spent some time looking at two of the main avenues that researchers have been looking into for genetic treatment or potentially even a cure for fragrance ataxia you may recall that i mentioned one of these studies was done as far back as 2014 there have been quite a few since and some before as well so what does the timeline look like in terms of turning this research that seems to show at least some proof of concept and some promise into an actual treatment for people obviously it&amp;#39;s completely understandable that we want a treatment as soon as possible for what is a really devastating disease for many patients and families what is that process of bringing this research to an actual person look like well the testing that i&amp;#39;ve talked about so far has really mostly been done in lab and animal models meaning that you look at individual cells in a dish and see oh we were able to make changes and now the cell that was having a problem before is able to make more for toxin and likewise you can look at a mouse for example that has a version of prefix ataxia and see if you&amp;#39;re able to make any changes there it&amp;#39;s a big jump to go from there to treating people there have been several genetic treatments for other diseases produced so far however and there is a process to go through this you may have heard of clinical trials before maybe in terms of something like covid where they&amp;#39;re talking about vaccine clinical trials or any other number of things well the food and drug administration in america goes through four different phases of clinical trials for people to even get to this stage you have to have done a lot of research ahead of time in order to think that hey we have something that&amp;#39;s viably worked in the lab and animals and we&amp;#39;re pretty confident that it could be usable in people and really importantly also safe so first of all they test a very small number of people first and check is our dose is correct and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s called a phase one clinical trial you&amp;#39;re not even necessarily looking for a response at that point in terms of improvement of symptoms it&amp;#39;s a little bit of exception for genetic diseases which we&amp;#39;ll go through at the end then move on to phase two clinical trials where you&amp;#39;re looking at is this actually working at all what are the major side effects in a relatively small group of people for going on to uh phase three and looking at really hopefully as many people as possible for its overall effectiveness and if it seems to be safe spread out out across a whole group of people and that the benefits outweigh the costs at that point if it seems to be effective the fda may consider approving it for the general population and you might have follow-up studies later surveying whether it seems to be useful in the public or not this system gets a little bit different in rare especially genetic diseases like friedrichs ataxia are you going to give a healthy volunteer without freedox ataxia a genetic treatment that might alter their dna as a phase one clinical trial probably not similarly you don&amp;#39;t necessarily have enough patients to do a large phase two or phase three clinical trial but overall we still use the system to a certain degree to decide whether or not we think a drug is even ready to be tested for patients in the first place and these are the different concerns that we have to have when we decide whether or not we&amp;#39;re going to even try it with patients the first is if this treatment is so expensive that it&amp;#39;s impossible to realistically give it to patients then it might not work out in the long run we&amp;#39;ve seen that some of these genetic treatments can cost upwards of millions of dollars and thankfully some of them have been approved by insurance and given their potential for lifelong improvements in treatment and cure it can definitely be worth it but you know if a cure costs 100 million dollars per person it&amp;#39;s going to be tough making that sell next you have to be concerned especially for something like a genetic treatment that it can cause reactions in patients if you have a major allergic reaction to it or some other issue then the side effects might be too dangerous to even consider treating it we talked especially last time with crispr cas9 about how you even deliver a treatment like this and before you can consider clinical trials we have to have something pinned down of how do we actually cause these genetic changes in the cells that we need to next we have to consider whether or not the changes that we&amp;#39;re making are hitting the right target we definitely only want to affect that faulty fxn gene and we want the greatest accuracy as possible with our genetic changes so that we don&amp;#39;t cause unintended side effects which could have disastrous um complications for patients but while there are currently no genetic therapies available for friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia there are reasons to be optimistic until 2017 there were no approved gene therapies for any type of condition despite the fact that there had been research into gene therapies for a variety of different cancers and inherited conditions since the 1990s fact is that in the last decade there&amp;#39;s been an explosion in terms of funding and available technologies to research these types of conditions as of my last count of last year there were eight approved genetic therapies for different types of conditions between the united states and the european union along with 13 others in phase 3 trials and dozens in phase 1 and phase 2 trials thank you for watching i hope this series of videos has been informative and helpful and like me i hope that you&amp;#39;re looking forward to any further advances that are made in terms of treatment and hopefully a cure for free drinks ataxia",

webinar for laramar Therapeutics Dr Rusty Clayton is the chief medical officer at larar Therapeutics and he&amp;#39;s going to be sharing with us an update on the n laest program and spend some time um giving us you know an overview of a study that is um starting very shortly that would be a new clinical trial for the n laus program I would encourage folks to submit questions during the webinar in the Q&amp;amp;A box it&amp;#39;s at the bottom of your screen try and use the Q&amp;amp;A box and not the chat um it&amp;#39;s just easier for us to monitor the Q&amp;amp;A um and at the end of Dr Clayton&amp;#39;s presentation Kellen and I will um share your questions uh during during a Q&amp;amp;A period so with that I am going to turn the webinar over to Dr Clayton thanks Jen good afternoon everybody and thank you for this opportunity to provide an update on the nalus clinical development program and talk about our future studies as you may know larer Therapeutics is developing nalus which we used to call CTI 1601 as a potential treatment for adults and children with Fredick at taxia nalus contains a protein that has three Parts F taxin A mitochondrial targeting sequence or MTS and a cell penetrating peptide also referred to on the slide as a CPP fraxin is a protein that is deficient in people living with Frederick&amp;#39;s at taxia we all make for taxin and ourselves but people with Fredick at taxi make a lot less on average about 20 to 30% of what we would find in somebody with with two normal chromosomes the mitochondrial targeting sequence is made by the cell with the fraxin and is attached to the fraxin so they come as a as you see on the left hand side they come as a a a two peptide unit as the name suggests the mitochondrial targeting sequence guides the fraxin through the cell to the mitochondria and gets it inside the mitochondria so the fraxin can do what it needs to do the cell penetrating peptide as you see on the right hand side of of your slide is a small piece that lamur attaches to the mitochondrial targeting sequence and when the where the gnome lusp is made this cell penetrating peptide gets the fraxin into the cell after it is injected so the way this all works is that GOM lopus is injected under the skin from there it gets into the bloodstream and goes all over the body the cell penetrating peptide gets the protein into the cells and the mitochondrial targeting SE quence gets the protein into the mitochondria once inside the mitochondria an enzyme called the mitochondrial processing peptidase Snips the fraxin from the mitochondrial targeting sequence and the fraxin is then free inside the mitochondria to do its work the fraxin molecule is made up of the identical amino acids that are in the fraxin that the body makes currently there are no treatment options that address the core deficit of redick&amp;#39;s at taxia namely low levels of fraxin nus represents the first potential therapy designed to increase F taxin levels in patients with Frederick&amp;#39;s at taxia please keep in mind that nalus is an investigational product and is not approved for use to treat any condition so far larer has completed two phase one studies and one phase two study in adults with Frederick&amp;#39;s at taxia Phase One studies are usually short studies that evaluate safety over a range of Doses and also are used to find out how much drug is in the bloodstream after one or several doses are given this this concentration or this how much drug is in the bloodstream this is called pharmaco D pharmaco kinetics or PK for short phase two studies are usually longer than phase one studies and are used to continue to evaluate the safety and pick the best dose or doses phase two studies start to measure the effectiveness of the drug either by measuring changes in biomarkers things that can be measured in a laboratory or with other tests or by measuring changes in symptoms there are also phase three studies these are large studies that are designed to definitively demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a drug after the completion of the phase one studies in adult laramar conducted a phase two study to evaluate Gom lopis in adults with fredi&amp;#39;s Axia we evaluated two doses a 25 milligram and a 50 milligram dose given daily for 14 days followed by every other day dosing for 14 days in addition to evaluating safety and PK Lam are also measured for taxin levels in cells taken from inside the mouth and skin cells in both cell types we observed increases in fraxin levels after 14 days of daily dosing as shown here bigger increases in protoxin levels were observed at the higher 50 milligram doses at the beginning of the year larer started an open labeled extension study and the patients who completed their participation in the completed studies were invited to particip participate in this open labeled extension study the first patient who enrolled in the study started receiving daily doses of Gom labus in March of this year since then we have continued to enroll patients into the study all of our all of the people participating in this study are receiving Nom laus there is no placebo group in this particular study in the phase two study we are collecting safety and PK data and we are also evaluating for taxin levels and clinical measures such as the M fars and the nine-hole peg test the people in the study are allowed to be taking omaveloxolone as part of their medication plan but there are some conditions around this to start gome labus they need to be taking omaveloxolone for at least six months if any participants are not taking omaveloxolone when they begin the study they they and but they want to start omaveloxolone they may have to wait to start omaveloxolone until they have been taking noobus for at least six months so far clinical studies in Nomo bofus have only involved adults with Freed at taxia laramar believes it&amp;#39;s important to develop a treatment for children with Fredick at taxia and it has always been Lamar&amp;#39;s intention to develop nomus for both children and adults with Frederick&amp;#39;s sat taxia I&amp;#39;m excited to announce that um we are about to start enrollment in a in a uh first study of Nal both has been children with friedrick at taxia this study is a phase one study that will evaluate safety and PK in adolescence and children with Frederick&amp;#39;s axian and we hope to start recruiting this week just like the adult studies participants who complete this study will be eligible to screen for the open label extension study the screening for the open label extension study will start after the last participant completes the study here are the details the study will be will be conducted at a single Center this uh Clinical Research Unit is called uncommon cures and it&amp;#39;s located in Chevy Chase Maryland ler selected uncommon cures as the site for this study because they specialize in clinical research in children living with rare diseases and the doctors and staff there are pediatric specialists in case you don&amp;#39;t know Chevy Chase Maryland is not far from Washington DC let&amp;#39;s talk about the study design there are two groups which we&amp;#39;re going to call cohorts in the study cohort one will be made up of adolescence 12 to 17 years of age with friederick sat taxia and cohort 2 will be made up of children 2 to 11 years of age with Frederick&amp;#39;s axum there will be about 12 to 15 participants in each cohort to be eligible for the study potential participants must have a genetically confirmed diagnosis of Frick&amp;#39;s Ataxia they must be able to sit up with support on two sides and be able to travel a distance of 25 ft with or without a wheelchair or other assisted device participants cannot have participated in any gene therapy trials in addition anyone who has taken any experimental treatments or has taken arthriten etravirine or gamma interferon for 90 days prior to study entry as well as anyone who is currently taking amiodarone is not allowed to participate since this is a phase one study adolescents Who are 16 or 17 years old and are taking omaveloxolone will not be allowed to participate vaccines are not allowed for 3 days before the start of treatment or for three 3 days after finishing treatment other medications are permitted but the dose of these medications need to be the same for four weeks prior to the start of the study the study starts off with a screening period that can last up to 35 days during this screening uncommon cures will contact the participants&amp;#39;s family and ask some initial questions to make sure that the potential participants meet certain inclusion criteria if that that goes well a visiting nurse will come to the participant&amp;#39;s home measure Vital Signs and get some blood samples to make sure there are un no unknown health problems that may affect study participation once all that information is reviewed Arrangements will be made for the participant and a family member or caregiver to travel to Cherry Chase Maryland and be put up in a hotel close to uncommon cures all travel and hotel costs will be covered by laramar for one or two days before the dos started the last screening test will be done including an electrocardiogram and an echocardiogram once all these screening procedures are done participants will be randomized to receive either Nom labus or Placebo the randomization is two to one meaning two out of three participants will receive galopus and one out of three will get Placebo during the treatment phase of the study the study is double blinded meaning that neither the participant nor the study staff will know who is getting gome laist and who is getting Placebo all participants will get an injection every morning for seven days at the study site on the first and last day of the treatment period blood samples will be drawn over eight hours to evaluate PK cell samples taken from the inside of the mouth will also be collected that&amp;#39;s what larar uses to measure for taxin levels on other days the participant needs to stay at the study site for 4 hours after receiving the injection at the end of the day the participants can return to the hotel by the way there will be a number to call if the participant has any problems while they are not at the study site after the seventh day of dosing there will be some testing then the participants and caregivers can go home a nurse will visit their home 7 days and 30 days after the last dose is given to check on the participant and get some blood samples and then after that 30-day visit the study participation is over the Adolescent cohort one will be completed first and then the child cohort 2 will start after laramar and an independent data monitoring committee get a chance to review the safety and PK data from cohort one as I mentioned before all participants who complete the study will be eligible to screen for the open labeled extension study we plan to to start screening for the open label extension study in adolescence after the last participant in cohort one completes the study for more information or to sign up for the study you can call 24858 4938 or 24858 4912 or email l-f uncommon cures.for before we answer any questions let&amp;#39;s spend a few minutes talking about the Nal Abus phase three study that is planned to start in the first half of next year this will be a big study conducted not just in the US but also in Europe the UK and Australia the study will be open to adults adolescents and children with Frederick&amp;#39;s at taxia laramar will be sharing more information about this study next year so to summarize the Nom laus open label extension is ongoing and enrolling the first n laus clinical study in adolescence and children with freed Axia is starting later this week and next year laramar will be starting a global phase three study again our thanks to Farah for allowing us to share this information with you",

    "transcript": "hello and welcome to FA Friday where every Friday I&amp;#39;m sharing my journey with Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia with you all if you&amp;#39;re new I&amp;#39;ve been doing this now this is episode 6 you can check them out on YouTube Facebook Instagram the topic for today is a Q&amp;amp;A about FA so let&amp;#39;s get into it okay so two episodes ago I asked people to ask questions in the comments my social media in YouTube and that I I said I would answer them so I know it&amp;#39;s been a couple of weeks you may have forgotten your question but I have them pull up here and I&amp;#39;m gonna go through one by one and just break them now so here we go all right question number one this is from Nathaniel and Amanda Martin thank you for your comment your question it says here my son was diagnosed with FA January 19 so about a year and half ago he was always playing football basketball lately he&amp;#39;s been having leg pain not playing a team sport due to the pandemic how do you know about like pain beam is it from FA is it from exercising you know it says here he&amp;#39;s falling but he&amp;#39;s still walking wandering about how I cope with FA and exercise yeah that&amp;#39;s a wonderful question thank you first of us hum to your son I just want to say stay strong stay encouraged it&amp;#39;s a hard road to walk but if you let it it will make you stronger on the inside it&amp;#39;ll make you a stronger person to go through this and God has a plan for you so stay strong young man and pains a lot personally I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t have like pain due to FA some people might have that and I would just ask around the fa community if anyone has that I personally could speak to your legs being sore after a workout would be a good a good thing because no pain no gain as far as actual pain no I don&amp;#39;t know ask around that I will say how do I cope with FA and exercise this is challenging because there can be a fear of being judged that I&amp;#39;ve realized a lot of people have for different reasons you go to the gym everyone&amp;#39;s in super great shape if you go to a lifetime everyone&amp;#39;s wearing some crazy outfit and it can be intimidating I had to come to a place where I just I don&amp;#39;t care about people judging me or what they think about me even if I do care I care more about my own health and so I&amp;#39;m gonna do it no matter what I do have a cane with me usually that kind of helps people understand okay I do have you know there is a reason I&amp;#39;m a little off-balance but I would say do everything you can as frequent as you can if you can still run run if you can walk walk if you can bike bike if you can lift weights lift weights maintain everything is as much to as you possibly can that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m doing going out walks daily working out daily trying to maintain strength balance go see a physical therapist and they&amp;#39;ll give you a lot of good workouts you can do so thank you for your question onto the next one from the P mill the P mill thank you he said what has been the most difficult challenge outside of a physical disability man this could be different for everybody I would say for me a challenge has been feeling misjudged misunderstood you know people may see you walking around I like to go shoot hoops people see you and just assume oh you&amp;#39;re weak oh you&amp;#39;re I&amp;#39;m athletic people may hear me talk they may assume oh you&amp;#39;re an alcoholic oh you do drugs they may assume I&amp;#39;m unintelligent because of how I talk when actually I did graduate college with a 4.0 GPA almost have finished my master&amp;#39;s with the 4.0 so just irony be misjudged and yeah that&amp;#39;s hard for me you know I feel like some people just won&amp;#39;t even take the time to get to know you and get to know your story and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s been a challenge for me everyone has different challenges but that&amp;#39;s a great question so thank you the P mill next question here Luke chase Thank You Luke he said thank you for sharing my question for your video is if you had a different world you do you feel you would be equipped to push through a trial like this great question I&amp;#39;m actually I know a different question was kind of related and so I&amp;#39;m gonna answer this question as I get to that one so Nancy Cole Thank You Nancy if she said how do you feel the Lord is using f-8 in your life so I&amp;#39;m gonna answer those two questions together Jimmy Babbington thanks Jamie Jamie I know SFA and I was enjoy our conversations so thank you he said yes a few he said besides balance and energy a be at any other physical setbacks yes my speech be more impaired has made it more more difficult to be a hip-hop artist I love lyricism and flow patterns and for me I&amp;#39;m kind of limited to writing in a way that I can keep up with so maybe I can get into ghost writing for a really fast rapper and see where that goes the yelets then one thing speech and then besides that yeah balance coordination energy you know I get madly fatigued I can&amp;#39;t run really anymore which is a bummer you know so he also said did your cane actually help you not really know it more just helps people you know some people that see me move and their sumed like I said that I&amp;#39;ve been drinking it just helps people know know what there&amp;#39;s something more going on I got followed by a security guard at my job and questioned and it made me realize I do need this cane to show people and it does help if it&amp;#39;s dark or slippery so I will say that but besides that not really much and then this is how I&amp;#39;m gonna conclude Jamie also ass there&amp;#39;s a lot of doom and gloom with FA I want to hear the good side you&amp;#39;ve had this your whole life what have you been able to achieve you know talking about sports talking about music school so I&amp;#39;m gonna tackle that question along with other questions about worldview and my faith the answer is yeah Jamie said did you ever hit a homer did you ever pitch double play make all-star teams hit a game-winner yeah you know back in the day I made the all-star teams I pitched I hit home runs at a game once I hit three home runs and a triple and one game you know I I hit a game-winning goal scored a game-winning touchdown hit a walk-off hit in baseball through a nine pitch three strikeout inning when I was younger so yeah you know I did I did do those things and it is a great feeling and in school I accomplished a lot too I&amp;#39;ve coached now for six years coach high school football I&amp;#39;ve coached high school baseball coach AAU basketball and that&amp;#39;s helping awesome and I miss that truly I really do miss the feeling of you know crossing the the goal line and scoring you know it&amp;#39;s a great feeling and I do miss that but I will say you know how did my faith impact my perspective if I didn&amp;#39;t have my faith and I didn&amp;#39;t have a worldview based on the Bible that shows me that God has a plan and the purpose for my life and I have an eternal hope in my life if I didn&amp;#39;t have that all I would be able to rely on is myself which is how it was when I was younger and I was always defined and my happiness was limited by how well I performed and on a day where I hit three homers yeah really good but a dad didn&amp;#39;t perform well I felt really bad you know when I would I would make the B team and wonder man watching them makes 18 you know in high school I got cut from the hockey team and those things crushed me you know my senior year in football I ended up mostly riding the bench and it crushed me but what I led me into was realizing man you know what my purpose is so much deeper than being in the athlete and eventually you know I got into doing spoken word doing music which if I didn&amp;#39;t have FA probably never would have happened I probably would have been playing a college sport and just still trying to pursue my dreams for myself but you know when I came to when I came to realize that I do have a greater purpose which is when sports kind of died for me you know I got into mentoring coaching and making uplifting music and you know it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a comment about how a song touched somebody or it&amp;#39;s a young person you mentored come you back years later and saying well thank you so much and that actually is better than any amount of homeruns you could hit I think yeah you could you know go to the NBA and make millions of dollars which would be cool and there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with that you could win a championship but to know that you have helped or impacted somebody is a better more rewarding feeling than any amount of game winning buckets and that&amp;#39;s I would say about my faith and my worldview about a different worldview I could have given up hope I could just be at home not doing anything and let FA just defy me and take over my physical mental and emotional well-being but no one have a purpose allows me to fight on and to keep a eternal perspective knowing that one day you know I will be fully restored physically and I believe that that will be in eternity and a perfect in heaven a perfect place with no no tears no pain no suffering and so that encourages me to press on and with that I would say thank you to everyone who asks a question I really appreciate it if you have any more questions comment on this video I&amp;#39;ll do another video I&amp;#39;ll answer questions as I go make sure you subscribe on YouTube Facebook Instagram and thank you for watching that&amp;#39;s FA Friday&amp;#39;s peace [Music] you",

    "transcript": "so um so uh first um you all know that but I wanted to start with that why we are doing clinical trial because placebo effect is useful in that context um but clinical trial is there to distinguish the effect of a drug on a Target condition and to uh distinguish the effect of this drug from other influences the first one is the spontaneous change of the course of the disease the second is the placebo effect and the third one is the uh Vis information and these three are supposed to be control via the Rand randomization so why dealing with the pl effective just randomization we have no more problem uh in the trial uh so the first point is to optimize the design of a trial uh in particular at the step of the sample size calculation if we uh when we calculate the sample size for trial we ex we have plans about the effect of the drug and plan about how the control group will evolve and if we don&amp;#39;t consider the placebo effects then we uh have um a chance not a chance we we could a probability to um underestimate the effect uh or overestimate the under the effect and then uh underestimate the number of of patients included in the future trial so it&amp;#39;s really important to know what is this Placebo affecting that context to take it into account the other um uh moment where I think it&amp;#39;s important for the trial we are going to go to trial with external controls there is FDA guidance for that but if we have external control and we don&amp;#39;t take into account the placebo effect then um we can have a a lose of power and for external control we can consider uh clinical trials Natural History or real world data and in the two last they can be a placebo the um the placebo effect is not considered and so uh we can imagine to add it uh when uh analyzing this kind of of uh trial so um to better evaluate the placebo effect we first need to know him and I have currently performed uh a preliminary metaanalysis of uh of this placebo effect on Sara which is the outcome we uh have in the in this attex and these are really preliminary results so um I would like any discussion about that and I Thanks Emilia p is my statistician on the project so what we have done um we have looked to three sources uh the first one is uh at the bottom uh we looked in clinical trial. go the uh trial with a mention of the scale for the assessment and rating of of aaia which is Sara uh we had a look to the recent uh review from Troy uh which included seven uh trials and then we also uh look to ped with the query about so Sarah with Axia not stroke in a random randomized trial putting everything together we had 74 papers different and we excluded some um some first because there was no publication for the trial this one from where from the clinical trial.gov uh some had no placebo group some were not in the Ataxia field and I will show you the disease we considered uh the next slide uh for two of one there were not trials and for two there were no Sarah uh data available which uh allowed to uh analyze 24 different uh paper from different uh trials so it&amp;#39;s larger than the shy uh paper um so um the problem is to have the the sar from this data we didn&amp;#39;t uh get the row data we analyzed only the data that are in the paper currently um First Option the Sarah was available in the paper so that was the Sarah change was available so that was perfect because we will be able to do the analysis um the second option we had the sah at B and at the one or several end points and then we were able to Cal to calculate the difference uh but we were not able to calculate the the standard deviation for that context the third option we had a graph with the evolution and then uh using um a tool we it can it is possible to retrieve the the data from the graph and finally on some paper we had only the difference between the plaso and the tradar and in that case it was not possible to um to have uh the information about the sah change in addition to the Sara we extracted the number of patients in the PLU arm the pathology the trial duration and the DAT of the trial so that is the 14 Trial that we found that are about drug intervention um there are the first one was in 2011 from Cuba on or oring in skyu patients uh with a relatively small sample size and a six Monon duration and then you can see all the others uh they are from various uh country um the Sarah basang was intermediate except for one trial where the patient were nine in mean uh at inclusion and the maximum was 24 we had various pathology uh some in scal some in FA and some included one sub type of disease and other a mixed a mix of stells or even mixed Axia um the sample say were really diverse from very small uh uh sample size to quite large uh with more than 100 and also the duration was really variable with some very short uh trial with one month or uh longer with no trial had more than 12 months and only five had a 12 month uh time uh and know known between 6 and 12 and you will see in the later in the graph um that we have ploted only uh to six months and you have the S change uh which are variable and we&amp;#39;ll see that later um the second slide is about the um the the trial about stimulation mainly uh there are tdcs or TMS uh and uh we can see that the the duration of this trial are very very short quite all are one less than one month and just two had a three months uh delay and they are mainly on mixed scals and with uh a little bit more advanced patients and finally we found three uh paper about Rehabilitation uh in with very small sample size and uh from two with scare two patient and one with scare seven um so some results um it&amp;#39;s interesting because the results are quite are similar to what Christian show but with some differences so here we you have a graph with in y axis the S change from Baseline uh on the top of the graph you have a disease progression which mean the natural history for instance and on the bottom which can be which sorry which can be the placebo effect um or at least an improvement while the patient is under placeable um the doter for each study and when you have a dotted line it&amp;#39;s because you we have two time point for the same same study and the size of the dots is depending on the sample size and finally we have three colors red for the drug green for the rehabilitation and blue for the stimulation study and um in Black you have the evolution of the the mean sah change across uh the six first month which is not significant with um a correlation of minus 0.9 and when we um removed the uh Rehabilitation study because in this study we don&amp;#39;t have a blind group um the coration is higher uh and quite significant um if we look at one year at one year there is an increase of the the s of 0.9 uh I remind it&amp;#39;s a mix of several uh uh different attas and the maximum is 1.7 and the minimum 0.3 which is quite similar to the Natural History so this is quite similar to uh what Christian showed with the uh far if we have short disease duration we show an improvement of the Sara but if we have longer uh followup it seems that the Sara um re uh deteriorate as uh if the patient had no Placebo in the context of Natural Evolution um do not hesitate to interrupt sop I have one question there sorry maybe I was too slow but um do you think the differences you shown there is this a difference why the intervention or via the time scale given that most of the so for example you know what I&amp;#39;m asking is yeah is the difference between drug RAB and stimulation is that the difference or is the difference between the time SC because most of the stimulations have the shortest time frames whereas for example most of the drug has the longest time frames so what is a Factor there I have the answer later but I can show you I have the answer here okay we at the look between the it&amp;#39;s on the the right of the the panel the right panel you have the uh effect for drug the rehabilitation and the stimulation and it&amp;#39;s not significant even the longer um uh the longer uh trial are all in the drug group and we have that outlier I will mention I have that in another slide so it seem that is mainly the duration than the kind of uh the type of intervention that that&amp;#39;s an important finding thank you yeah um yeah uh the other point we add a because Christian said that the um IO effects increased with time with the date the the year the the the the the trial took place and we have the same Evolution here and removing the rare Bots the correlation are quite similar so um on the first and we removed this outlier which is uh uh oranging sulfat uh in Cuba skue so it&amp;#39;s a really really um important Improvement um on placebo group for this trial which is quite different than the other studies but we found the same thing that uh the placebo effect is more and more important uh in with Sarah which is not a good point for the future trial because if we I don&amp;#39;t know where the the line will stop um then we look to the value of the b b Sarah um sopie sorry for interrupting I&amp;#39;m just playing the moderator here that was one I&amp;#39;m monitoring the chat so I&amp;#39;m assuming the moderator there was one yeah sure yeah how how do you explain the date dependence um the the hypothesis is that uh as drug are coming patient think that they can have I don&amp;#39;t know exactly but um I think we already discussed that last time with Christian um or with uh yeah but I I don&amp;#39;t really explain but I it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s common it&amp;#39;s not only in scast chrisan do you have an explanation for this Chris I don&amp;#39;t know with your online Chris I don&amp;#39;t know if we look um a disease where there are 20 or or 25 years of Trials if where this line goes because it can goes to to minus infinite so you need to stop somewhere so I don&amp;#39;t know if we had 10 more years if it will stop or increase I don&amp;#39;t have the data and I&amp;#39;m not yeah so I course I don&amp;#39;t have an explanation but but is it really the type of drug or the type of trial that is done I mean Rehabilitation or stimulation can there is this really the same placebo effect so that&amp;#39;s my first question but even if we look only at the at the drug trials maybe these drugs have just carried more promise to the patients they&amp;#39;re also the biggest ones they&amp;#39;re also the biggest ones clearly yeah but when we looked yes the the last one or the biggest one um but and for the first comment about the the type of U of trial we see that we have also blue dots here and green there so yeah there is a mix not just the re then the the the stimulation and then then the drug there seem to be mixed there&amp;#39;s a Comon from yeah um yes it&amp;#39;s just to say that over time it&amp;#39;s has been shown in uh in uh in depression they followed during 20 years and effectively the effect size becomes more and more important with the time and it was explained because uh you know the take care has been changed over the years and I think we we take care of the patients clinicians know take care of the patient will provide much more um care than it was 10 years ago 20 years ago and so that helps finally to have a higher placebo effect potentially potentially but where where it stops I hope it will stop once because of yes it&amp;#39;s because you have you have 20 years of of of Trials there we have only 10 is there is is there only plateauing happening in depression do you see anything or is it still going on in I I think there is no followup anymore now you see so uh but it has been published yes and it has been seen I think it was the the the European agency who who make um who made um um homemade stock uh from the the the files they received over 10 to 20 years and and they said they they saw it really over 10 to 20 years that it was constantly improving one more question is sopia what just said this intensive taking care of the patients adding to the placebo effect is that what you have been framing the cocooning effect or is that still something different no I expect it&amp;#39;s the same but um yeah but there is also the way the patient are are the clinici should take care of the patients um there are new technology IES there are more information there are a lot of other thing than the co cocing but but this is just just just just semantically that is what you have been the cocooning effect is this taken care of I I&amp;#39;m not able to distinguish here in that uh study the cuning from the other effects no no no that answer on story it&amp;#39;s just a pure semantic question cocooning effect is the taking care of effect independent data I I think so yes yeah okay thank you thank you um so um one more comment sop oh yeah sure I think um what might be a little bit misleading here is the duration of the trial yeah because what what you see in Fr clearly clearly that it goes away at one year yeah it depends of course on the trial because the diversity of patients so big but of course in the most aggressive young patients after one year the Natural History will just catch up with a placeo effect and that is something that should also make a difference here between three months and six months so if yeah if we look to the 12 months uh study which are here in more dark c u they are from the first one in was in 2012 and the last in 201 17 and we see that the the the effects increase and then decrease so with quite similar sample size so yeah you could see that on your graph where you have the trial duration I think you also had the correlation yeah but I I&amp;#39;ve removed the the 12 years can&amp;#39;t see the 12 month here was going up yeah that&amp;#39;s the important point I think yeah and we don&amp;#39;t have have trial with intermediate value so I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on between 6 month and 12 month between new trials had Endo at 9 month for instance so it was why I removed because it was difficult to know what was going on from here and then we are 0.9 is quite here so we have a point here but what is between I don&amp;#39;t know um one more question from the chat and C is asking did you follow randomization influence and perceiv effect for example did one: one versus one to three randomization might this give a different placebo effect did you check for the randomization effect of rization of placebo no I didn&amp;#39;t with this and I&amp;#39;m asking I&amp;#39;m seeing Alex swlo as being part of the participants Alex you have been doing a lot of work on the randomizations in rcts not in Texas but in other neurological diseases is this known from the literature whether the randomization um um ratio does have an impact on the placebo effect Alex do you know uh yeah that that&amp;#39;s a good question matis I think it it&amp;#39;s not easy to answer so it&amp;#39;s yes and no so I think it yeah if it depends on what type of randomization right it depends on the assumptions are applied so I think if it&amp;#39;s unequal allocation randomization then it may be more problematic if it&amp;#39;s one to one randomization then it may be better then it&amp;#39;s also presence of the time Trends and the data and some other assumptions so I think the answer is it depends in general so it may or may not thank Al yeah hello maybe I could comment a bit on the my question sure yeah just very short I recall one discussions on one uh smoking cessation trial where the randomization were one to three so 25% only got Placebo and there was very much bigger placebo effect than expected so which brought into problems of course and and one of the speculations was that it might be that the expectations of the patients were more actually and and there was less chance to get into Leos so so that was so I just wondering whether there is can be a follow up on that because yeah not sure how important but unequal randomization certainly makes things more complicated and indeed there may be expectations on the patient side that they they&amp;#39;re more likely to receive the active treatment and that that certainly may affect the outcome especially if it&amp;#39;s uh you know not really the the biological measure so more objective so if if it&amp;#39;s in psychiat or you know depression so that may affect but then there are many other factors it&amp;#39;s you know whether the trial is blinded or open label whether outcome assessors are blinded properly so there&amp;#39;s some evidence actually that all these factors separately individually or in combination may affect uh the placebo response and the effect of the P thank you thank you sopia I think you can go on move on okay uh so um we didn&amp;#39;t look to randomization indeed and blinding most our uh blinded study except the random the rehabilitation ined because it&amp;#39;s quite difficult to have a blinding in that context um so um we had a look to the Baseline Sara value following what Christian shows uh there is a tendency that with higher SAS score the um placebo effect is smaller but it&amp;#39;s not significant so it seems that it&amp;#39;s less uh infuence that in with fars in in a and we didn&amp;#39;t remove the fa patients there to or stratified fa SC can be done but we didn&amp;#39;t uh and lastly we have show seen already the the type of intervention effect but we looked also to the continent effect we just pulled the between America asan and Europe and America is North and South America um there is a a difference with the a Asian uh study where the placebo effect was larger than in the two others but in the European there are all the this long uh trial with one year so it increase uh uh but even if we remove these points the I are lower than the European ones maybe you can ask it out loud then it&amp;#39;s maybe easier to understand for everybody um yes it&amp;#39;s just that Sophie said it should be nice to multiply the visits but it has been shown that sometimes multiplying the visits might inclu the placebo effect and I don&amp;#39;t know what can what to be done in in case there is a learning effect on our clinical outcome um how would that impact the placebo I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s just purely a question but if we multiply the visits and that there is some some way or another any learning effect how will that interact with the placebo I&amp;#39;m afraid it can even increase it um more or reduce it finally I don&amp;#39;t know uh did you get my question yeah yeah sure but there might be no answer I don&amp;#39;t have the answer okay so I don&amp;#39;t either um I don&amp;#39;t know if there is a learning effect on Sarah I&amp;#39;m not sure but I don&amp;#39;t have the proof of that um Sarah is used in the the foll of the patient at least in some centers and yeah what will be the study or project we would have to run to to to answer this question whether there is a learning in this s so what we would need is we would have a high frequency repeated SAS in a short time frame and see whether there&amp;#39;s Improvement or not yeah yeah it can be uh learning but it can be also variability of the patient and uh from the paper from the Thomas team they have shown that there is variability of the patient so but if the variability if is higher than the potential learning effect and then more the variability is a problem than the learning isn&amp;#39;t would that conclusion there that yeah yeah but this having said so we still have to keep in mind that this was a Sarah home paper so it&amp;#39;s not Sarah home is still something different than real Sarah so there some comparison might correlate but still it&amp;#39;s different thing but it&amp;#39;s the best we have yeah Rosa you unblinded yourself I&amp;#39;m blinded um no I&amp;#39;ve always actually been curious about the learning effect um in patients who are followed in clinic you know so regularly followed in clinic P versus um so if you&amp;#39;re recruiting from your own Clinic versus um a trial that is getting referred um I and again without having access to data or you know collecting that information I think it&amp;#39;ll be very difficult to know so if a patient is naive to the clinic um you know doesn&amp;#39;t or doesn&amp;#39;t know that Sarah there may be more learning effect compared to someone who regularly follows up with you know the clinic um you know sees the same doctor every three or every six months when there may be less learning effect thank you thank you for this comment there is an additional comment from Kenya Kenya you want to speak it out loud do you want me to read it from the chat uh yes uh could you read it sure Kya is asking Kenya would like to know if you have seen any association between the placebo fact on the one hand and the severity of attack on the other hand um he&amp;#39;s saying in the double blind studies in Japan on um on voline from Japan in 2020 they saw a larger placeo effect in the milder Tex patients as defined by saral less than 10 points as compared to the more severely affected detector patient are larger than 12 and he&amp;#39;s even saying the or has no planning the next study to be set in patients with um Terra larger than 12 given that those apparently those more affected patients had a less Place effect Sophie two questions to you first of all did you see the same and I think you already you had on one slide where you showed I think that the basine ter did not have an influence maybe you can go back to this one and secondly can you give this more general question from kenar do you think would you would you would you think that&amp;#39;s a PL approach what this Japanese team is now planning to do for the next step yeah um that&amp;#39;s the the the the slide uh on this slide we plot the mean Sara at Baseline versus the Sarah change and we cannot stratify because we don&amp;#39;t have the r data that will be an additional analysis that could only be done on the RO data so I what I can see is that with a mean s score there is no uh with the sample size we have there is no not a clear correlation between the SAR Baseline and the Sarah change but it&amp;#39;s on it on the mean Sara but this having said so Sophi you could also phrase it differently you do not find evidence that the milder affected patients do have a larger placebo effect indeed yeah so Kya I think the respon you you can see that the the the mean Saras SC Baseline we have one uh which is quite close of zero pressing symptomatic and the other one are from 9 to 20 and yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s difficult to have a clear answer from this analysis but you might even want to argue whether you should have included this this Green Dot on the left side in there as well I mean taking the Sarah in a in a population with with a mean sah of what is it one or point8 what what just the Sarah do there there&amp;#39;s nothing you can there doesn&amp;#39;t do anything there in this range it&amp;#39;s just noise you anyway anyway um Christian Christian has yeah and yeah so I think there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s several things obviously affecting the placebo effect it&amp;#39;s the severity of the patient it&amp;#39;s the genetic severity of the patient it&amp;#39;s the and then there&amp;#39;s these technical things there&amp;#39;s the time force that we see and let&amp;#39;s just look at those and and see what what we see in in F what is the strongest effect and we clearly see the time course at 3 months it&amp;#39;s strongest and then the Natural History kicks in it&amp;#39;s stronger in genetically milder patients I haven&amp;#39;t looked at I haven&amp;#39;t looked at Baseline scores um at least I I don&amp;#39;t remember now maybe I did but um and the the strongest effect that is there is it only exists in appendicular items so everything that ignores these um is it&amp;#39;s doing do to fail so um I I assume that the placebo effect in all these dots or behind all these dots that&amp;#39;s s he is showing is is because of the appendicular items not because of the axal tests so so not able to analyze this right because you did not he not I know I understand yeah yeah yeah no but that&amp;#39;s something I mean we could take home and then see I mean Sophie that&amp;#39;s something we you should be working in the in the next years to come really we need to get access to the raw data and then run in in particular this analysis question yes and I have I have one more comment that is a bit little bit uh further away so there is this fact that in in the spinal cbell attackes and in the Saras patients are aware of their scores we know that they discuss them they say I&amp;#39;m at this level I I was last time I was at that level I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a good thing it will increase the learning effects and it will have a big influence on the tests and of course the more often you do it um the more people will learn and the more people will remember and um that I think is something that should be stopped and not be done it&amp;#39;s a research tool it&amp;#39;s not something for a patient to assess himself so to know about himself for that um a patient would have to understand the tool and I&amp;#39;m not saying there are no patients who don&amp;#39;t understand of course that exists but the majority of patients doesn&amp;#39;t understand the variability in such a test and how much is is just going to be off because of the variability but that&amp;#39;s another aspect I&amp;#39;m just saying less tests less knowledge about the about the tool in a patient will will increase these will will make these problems easier to handle no patient knows their far their far scores that just doesn&amp;#39;t exist they don&amp;#39;t even see what they score so the score is just given from the from the rater to the patient who enters in the CRF without the patient noticing it yeah and I think that will that will help a lot with these problems with a lot of them not not with all of them yeah thank you Christ I have one question my brain is too small to think it through but having UK Christen and sopia on the call let me try to get two knots together what we have been seeing our recessive attex patients and sopia in the atis dominant patient is is that indeed the at least the appendicular items might add some variability to the to the to the to the Natural History progression of this era let&amp;#39;s assume let&amp;#39;s just assume so so so might not fully agree but let&amp;#39;s assume this this is you know I&amp;#39;m not completely yeah yeah that&amp;#39;s just assume for the of the argument that&amp;#39;s one observation and the second observation question which is you having is that the the the particular items are also in particular more PR to the placebo effect now are those two observations linked and causally linked is it because they are more V variable variable they are thus more PR to Placebo effects is that a calling or this to Independent phenomenon which might then even add up in a trial could you comment on this question I don&amp;#39;t see why they would be related or depend on each other variability and placebo effect are two different things I wish think they are less biological and thus more PR to intervening effects like if the SE effect that would be a istic I think they are more prone to placebo effect because they are less natural things that people just don&amp;#39;t do okay they can train and um then they get better yeah okay that&amp;#39;s speculation I have no clue thank you there is a question from the chat from Rosa you Ros you want to ask it yourself oh um I was kind of I was asking kind of about the placebo effect and looking at other you know uh looking at the experience from other people if they could comment on if there are trials with long screening periods um like whether four or six months then would that um help with the placebo effect and learning at some point learning plateaus I would imagine any comments I would would impact would you just make the study longer then yeah it makes the study longer but for the patient itself it don&amp;#39;t increase the patient participation so uh the the study is longer but the type of you know study um the type of assessments done are less burdensome in the screening period perhaps than the actual file itself but again this is you mean the screening period the patient is screened and then it start the the the the study is correct yeah okay because I didn&amp;#39;t understand the the screening period as I just understood the period where the clinician recruit screen the patient yeah so during the time that they&amp;#39;re recruiting uh so or screening so often times for the trial there&amp;#39;s a ideally only four weeks or six weeks um time point but I um I think I I recall that the in the Huntington&amp;#39;s disease the PTC they have a very long screening slash natural history study before the patients are in entered into the um the actual drug trial and and then there&amp;#39;s also another um uh stem cell therapy um H in Huntington&amp;#39;s um trial where they actually had a threeyear screening period quote unquote um they&amp;#39;re follow the patients are followed for three years before they&amp;#39;re considered eligible for stem cells so again just wondering if that would improve the actual placebo effect during the trial itself because the trial itself is from the Baseline line is the day one of active treatment I think patients know where they&amp;#39;re started to be treated so has Placebo is coming most of the time from the expectation they have finally from the drug I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not sure you know having a longer screening period might uh might finally reduce your placebo effect I don&amp;#39;t know but I I think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really linked to when you start to be treated so I think um um yes they it could not help but it&amp;#39;s just personal opinion okay no and and and of course the the concern is the actual effect of the placebo from the from the treatment and I I think we were talking earlier about is the effect really the expectation of the patient or is it learning and so if it&amp;#39;s learning effect that&amp;#39;s accounting for the quote placebo effect that we&amp;#39;re seeing then we would um you know reduce the quote learning effect with a longer screening period perhaps or more frequent assessments you know during the screening period yeah interesting thought thank you everybody we are getting close close to the hour um this was the last session of this studio Series so far planned I have put in the chat the questions if you guys know have any further systematic question related to the placebo effect in the Tex would you think we should discuss an another Studio please let me know either type it now into the chat or shoot me an email and ideally you would already have a speaker or an input presentation somebody giving an input presentation on this topic and then we could think about a fourth um um studio session within this series which will likely take either place still take place in July or after the summer break so please let me know with this I would like to thank first of all the three speaker teams or input teams cier team rodri Mars from the first studio session the second studio session thanks a lot to Christian and for the third one thanks a lot to Sophie for your time attending presenting this is always takes time it&amp;#39;s extra effort thanks a lot but then also thanks a lot to all the discussion and what you could also see over the Three Studio sessions is there was a learning trajectory also in terms of participation I enjoyed the studio today the most because we had the highest level of participation of discussing so I really love this um thanks a lot I think we as a community are learning also we are learning this format thanks a lot for your discussions for the inputs I think we keep this at least this serious going the studio Series going so if you have other topics to be discussed in the studio not related to perceiv want any other methodological main problem in the Tex Tri Readiness field we could and will host other Studio sessions and series as the AGI as part of the AGI in the next months and could we are open to your suggestions again this was the discuss suggestion from Rod Mar and cier coming at a glass of wine at the last Dallas meeting so please feel free to shoot me your suggestions and your ideas and we will keep those um discussions going with this thanks a lot for this discussion and have a nice week",

    "transcript": "tick tick tick tick uh sorry for that yeah so uh the second is a younger gentleman who comes with a more gradual history and third is a very young 11 year old girl who comes with only the history we can falls and some imbalanced personalities so these are very three common scenarios and by the end of the class we learn to how to approach to each of them to make a management plan right so as as in any approach in neurology we have a step routine steps so first to identify what is the physiological diagnosis that is what is the problem or what is the syndrome so there are three main questions which arise i will come to that the second of course will always be what is the localization uh clinical localization and finally what is the etiology so at each step we&amp;#39;ll see that when it comes to a patient who comes with attacks here and there are three three main questions that arise right so the what the taxa basically means [Music] taxi basically means order so it accepts lack of order so disordered gate disordered walking talking and minor effects in the cerebellar circuits can lead to major problems as well so uh when we come to the questions so what is the problem so any patient who says that he has imbalance in doing work or walking or any other problem so the first thing we needed what is the phenomenon is it really a taxi or something else so always remember that patients who have difficulty in walking imbalance may not necessarily be toxic they can be actually true motor weakness as well uh both element lower motor as well as upper motor type of weakness so we see often uh patient who comes saying imbalance the problem is not actually texted the problem is specificity now the second question is is there true attacks here there is no motor weakness or if there is a partial weakness is there a taxi on top of that and the third question is if there is a tax here what is the extent of attacks here is it to the gate detects of limb which limb both sides are one side is there any effects of speech or our eye movements then we try to localize it so localization whether it&amp;#39;s an anatomical localization cerebellar sensory or some other globalization so these are the three usual sites the most common are cerebral line sensory vestibular and frontal causes of detection are less likely etiology also has three main questions we&amp;#39;ll come to that later the first things will be uh identifying it axiom and localizing it action other predictable components to any approach so basically we&amp;#39;ve seen that there are disorderly movements they can just present imbalance and false as well it takes your speech the classically disappear the most classical example is tactical speech or a scanning speech both are different and of eye movements so uh we have to differentiate at this moment whether it is a true attacks here and the gate typically is not because of a motor weakness so coming to low localizations uh these are in brief all the possible localization when a patient comes with uh ataxia so we have cerebellum and its connections uh super particle as well as below the cortex to go into the spine uh and including the uh when it comes lower down we have to increase the sensory part uh pathways as well festival rate xc also is not very common but it is seen in severe vestibular dysfunction some frontal lobe patients with number of dysfunction can have difficulty invoking but those have many other features and they&amp;#39;re not just limited to attacks so is it possible to get a fair localization with just history and examination so if the imbalance is mostly while walking so that&amp;#39;s a gate attacks here [Music] that generally localizes to either sensory or a cerebellar usually most of the cerebellar attacks are bursting when we walk on uneven grounds [Music] this happens more if there is additional spasticity so if there&amp;#39;s a lowering species for example a patient with cervical spondylotic myelopathy they will fall multiple times on an uneven ground whereas they must be much better on a pain ground sensory texture doesn&amp;#39;t usually worsen that much on an uneven ground imbalance that worsens at night typically seeming sensory attacks here not just at night whenever the visual cues are lost for example washing the face and sign is a classic example in india often we see that a patient will be walking at night and suddenly there&amp;#39;s a power loss the light goes off and they become severely attacks it can be fall down as well imbalance that involves hand functions more than legs so cerebral hemisphere involvement will impaired hand functions more than legs [Music] so uh whereas uh a midline involvement in the cerebellum will in impair gain dysfunction when there is imbalance with severe spinning sensation vomiting we have to consider vestibular electricity more likely however it is still possible in cerebral palsy when cochlear nodular node clock will or nodular node is lobe is involved imbalance on one side of course leads to more likely to be a cerebellar hemispheric involvement on the same side so uh theoretically although uh [Music] sensory text can arise from nerve dorsal root ganglion or dorsal column what we commonly see is [Music] it usually arises from either a dorsal volume dysfunction or a dose of root ganglia of course large fiber neuropathy causing sensation is also quite common so clinical features uh one we clearly know that there may be other positive or negative sensory symptoms uh and the most important thing is that it takes a worsens with loss of sensory cues so there may be pseudo ptosis there&amp;#39;s abnormal movement of the lymph especially when the eyes are closed on examination there will be loss of joint position and your vibration sense may be impaired rhomboid sign may be positive so as soon as you close the eyes the patient will fall like a log so when we check for rhombos one important thing is to see that whether it&amp;#39;s a delayed wrong so the does the patient start swaying swaying after a long time and then falls that is not classic of sensory attacks here so it&amp;#39;s somebody who has a taxi because of sensory dysfunction as soon as you close if the patient closes the eyes they will start falling reflexes will be impaired in patient sensory text here so the ideology based on the localization uh varies so now we know that can be inflammatory toxin para protein loss of ganglion loss of column multiplied is based on the localization so evaluation if you have a sensory attacks here you go ahead with the nerve conduction studies may be imaging and in some cases now biopsy may be required the largest cause of indexes of course are the cerebellar group of disorders so this is section at the line of the cerebellum uh this is just to show that uh cerebellar disorder for cerebellar ataxia need not just arise from cerebellum so whenever we say we say that localized cerebellum and its connections the connections to wire to the brainstem via the superior middle and inferior cellular peduncles so any dysfunction in those will cause very similar symptoms or the science as cerebellar dysfunction itself so this is grossly how the cerebellum is divided so you have the anterior lobe which is in dark yellow and a small very small group predominantly the vermis is there the posterior lobe is the largest which has a big too big cerebral hemispheres and interiorly we have the floccular node error so ah and these are all the various connections that to the brainstem but the anatomically however what is important is the functional runner function anatomically it may be different but physiologically functionally the importance may be completely different for example the midline is the vermis and the paravermine regions and the cerebellar hemispheres so these are all more functionally connected than anatomic hemispheres for example the midline is more connected to gate and head movements motor execution pathways the the lateral most the cerebellar hemispheres they are more important for motor planning and fine movements and hand movements they are more important the inferior part that is the vestibular cerebellum that&amp;#39;s the oldest cerebellum that is more important in balance and eye movements so the midline cerebellar structures uh will generally cause gate attacks here truncal attacks here and head movements inferior will cause vertigo lateral cerebellum cerebellum will cause more of hand functions function so this is a figure that shows how the what is the orientation of structures in the hemispheres exact localization however may be very difficult because larger relations are we will go to the clinical science so as we said earlier it actually can be of the gate of gate limb and speech so you have to examine from top to bottom so starting with eye science you have nystagmus so nystagmus generally is does not fatigue as against a vestibular nystagmus cerebellum usually does not fatigue when very classical if it&amp;#39;s in the cpi a lesion is in the cp angle you get a very classical instrument it&amp;#39;s called the bruins timeless the other nystagmus which is more specific to cerebellum is the rebound is diagnosed so you ask the patient to look on the right side and then quickly if the patient looks anteriorly as the movement comes that then there&amp;#39;ll be a brief mistagness the other clinical sign that is very often seen more important than nystagmus is uh eye movement dysmetrium psychedelic dysmetria so when you ask the patient to quickly follow a target uh from one point to the other so you have the visual look here and then here and then here and then here as the patient moves the eyes so the eye generally misses the target a little bit and then comes back it&amp;#39;s just like this material so i moves misses a target and then comes back if this movement is too much then it may seem like a nystagmus as well the other clinical sign is that of dysarthria so dysarthria is generally the patient speaks much more louder the speech may not be very clear it may come in bursts as well so patiently normal mistakes normal and then very loudly and then again normal and then again very loudly so that is something which is called stack at a speech and the patient may have pauses holds and suddenly the patient is pain that kind of speech is called a scanning type of speech this material is again a dysfunction of cerebellum that causes difficulty in gauging the length so if i i ask a patient to touch my finger which is at 50 centimeter the patient may go beyond that may go up to 60 or 70 centimeters and then try to come back correct it uh to the finger as well so that is a dyslexia the patient is not able to cage distances this synergia is a hormone so it basically describes all the problems so basically there&amp;#39;s a synergy in different muscle groups there is a impaired synergism so [Music] that makes all functions very difficult also and one specific part of the symmetry is agonist antagonist coordination so when i&amp;#39;m moving my finger to a target so i need the triceps to contract as my hand is pressing and at that time the biceps will relax however as the my finger approaches the target my biceps will start contracting to slow the movement and so that at the end when i&amp;#39;m about to reach my target the finger reaches more accurately and in the end the triceps will again contract so that the finger can finally reach the target this is a typical triphasic pattern of contraction of agony santa gonna say goodness so in any moment usually you have a large initially large movement by the agonist then the antagonist contracts just a little bit to fine-tune the movement and finally the movement is finished by the agonist of course this movement is completely disorganized in a patient with a cerebral dysfunction and that we see in two forms one is this is adequate kinesia when we ask the patient to do rapidly alternating movements so the patient cannot do that because uh the either the agonist contracts for a very long time and the antagonist contracts quite late and then when the antagonist contract that also contracts may have contact for a very long time so this needs to difficulty move the performing rapidly alternating the other place how we can see is rebound phenomenon we ask the patient to contract the hand and we suddenly release it so a person should be able to check it that&amp;#39;s when the antagonist starts firing a lot and it prevents the hand from moving too much to a too much ahead any unwanted movement it prevents but however this have this is lost in a patient with a cerebral dysfunction cerebellar cerebellum is also important to maintain uh tone of the muscles so that&amp;#39;s why any cerebral dysfunction usually causes a low tone however reflexes are normal so a low tone reduce stone along with normal reflexes give rise to something very specular inside the dysfunction that is pendular electrics so when you hit the target so normally we&amp;#39;ll have a reflex which goes up and then comes back down whereas in pendulum reflexes the moment the foot pill if you have done a knee jerk will keep on moving it will not stop so anything if the leg moves more than three times we can call it pendulum reflex which is positive tremor is another typical finding in cerebral dysfunction usually it&amp;#39;s an action tremor there can be a posterior tremor as well so based on this we have some syndromes and sometimes it is important to identify the syndromes because they can help in a final diagnosis as well so for example midline syndrome so mentally syndrome arises because of a damage the worm is uh vermis extends as we see to the excess structures so that&amp;#39;s why it leads to dysfunction of gate head and trunk balance so the patient may have a ton trunk uh tremor trunk dysfunction imbalance the the most important part is gate dysfunction so they have a wide base gate tandem walking will be difficult sometimes they can have yes yes kind of division as well the most common causes are chronic alcohol toxicity and in children middle elastomers the other common which we&amp;#39;ll see in casualties typically is the hemispheric syndrome and we have to remember that the deficits are unilateral and they are obsilated to the lesion this is because of double crossing of fibers and they&amp;#39;ll have all the cerebellar signs on one side and they usually involve more upper limb more than the lower limb there can be a cerebellar arm drift the usual causes of this acute presentation we have ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes subacute we have patients who have multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating disorders and we can have tumors as well there are some patients who will have all signs they&amp;#39;ll have gate dysfunction they&amp;#39;ll have cerebellar dysfunction they&amp;#39;ll have a hemispheric dysfunction bilateral and cervical function i science so these in this kind of patients are going to be called that you have a pan cerebellar syndrome and the usual etiologies for this are drugs toxins spinal cerebral detectors and parasymplastic disorders so once we have localized the third step in diagnosis is for etiology and this has three important questions again so what is the temporal evolution is it acute subacute or chronic what are the neurological features other neurological pitches and what are the associated systemic features out of these the first temporal evolution is the most important that you&amp;#39;ll get only on this tree so uh in fact the next approach is based on temporary evolution itself so when we are doing uh when we are [Music] looking for evolution we have to uh make sure that uh if a patient for example a patient presents with a history of two years of a tax year so we have to ask the patient about whether the onset was acute or not or was it a gradual answer so one typical way to find that is the onset to peak what is the disability what was the time for example a patient who worsened initially but has been static the differentials will be different as against a patient who has been progressively improving or worsening or has had improvement up there so the course of illness is important so acute access the commonest causes that we know are cerebellar stroke which may be ischemic or hemorrhaging toxins acute toxicity of alcohol anti-epileptic in fact alcohol toxicity causing cellular dysfunction makes it acts as one of the commonest neurological disorders other less common causes which we may see once in a while are infections and more important than bacterial viral infections are the post varicella cerebellulitis which is very common now subacute a patient will generally come with a history of few hours two days uh maybe up to three weeks so the etiology for these is a again a big group of disorders usually in in inflammatory disorders and infective disorders so infections we have more slower infections and more important will be the implemented disorders like multiple sclerosis adam newton attacks as another positive one thing to never forget is that in a slightly older person is a paraneoplastic subacute cerebral degeneration again drugs and alcohol can cause a subacute worsening as well now chronic chronic detections are generally over months and years and they can be either acquired or genetic so uh the genetic etexters that we generally see in adults will be largely in the spinal cerebral retextual autosomal dominant group of disorders the autosomal recessive patients which include friedreich&amp;#39;s etaxias detector injectors yes these patients generally present a little bit earlier so in the first or second decade itself so if you uh so the important uh reason to identify that is that if you have an elderly patient who has a family history he is more likely he or she more likely to have a spinal cerebellar attacks here the younger patient will more is more likely to have autosomal recessive the the autosomal dominant group that is sca they&amp;#39;ll generally have a family history which will be positive and in ai the family history may or may not be positive other errors subtypes are friedreich&amp;#39;s uh frstas and rarely even mitochondrial disorders the other large group is the in chronic ataxias is the immune mediated and the degenerative etiologies but of which it is important to identify the immune mediated ones because they respond to therapy as well so i will not be going into those those subtypes so we&amp;#39;ll uh any chronic attacks here with uh you have to reload any uh auto even causes so this approach is important to make sure that we don&amp;#39;t miss out treatable causes as well as avoid unnecessary a patient who comes with acute attacks here we can sending generative testing is of no use so that way we can avoid unnecessary testing as well as make sure that treatable causes are not mixed so in patients who have a static attacks here balance training helps a lot especially in preventing falls and maintaining day-to-day activities so a lot of patients who have just cortical dysfunction cerebral cortex which is involved they have a lot of improvement with balance returning when deeper nuclear involved then they have a more poor response to therapy newer therapies in form of upcoming in form of gene replacement in genetic disorders uh we have uh genetic replacement which has been started for fredericks atexia and trials are to be started soon for uh some of the spinous cerebral radiation cerebellar stimulation is another upcoming topic so uh cerebellar stimulation has been tried as a non-invasive as well as invasive means so non-invasively we can use dms which we are using in our department as well to some extent at least the tremor comes down and although gate dysfunction may not respond as much people have tried invasive cerebral stimulation as well with various degrees of success some patients it has been of no use at all some patients have reported success but mostly in form of tremor rather than a taxi any questions [Music] any questions anyone",

    "transcript": "want a copy of the materials to take home so in terms of our agenda today we&amp;#39;re going to start off with a clinical focus and we&amp;#39;re going to have a clinical panel going through different aspects of managing fa and then we&amp;#39;re going to go into oops we&amp;#39;re going to go into more of the research topics so we&amp;#39;re going to have a whole panel discussion on clinical stage research programs so clinical trials that are ongoing right now and then Lane and I are going to give an overview of what&amp;#39;s kind of happening in gene therapy and Gene editing and then we&amp;#39;ll have a clinical trial participation panel discussion I know that&amp;#39;s going to be very Lively and then the afternoon we&amp;#39;re going to switch Focus and we&amp;#39;re going to have a guest speaker Dr Dan Dan Gottlieb he joined us about 12 years ago so some of you may recognize the name um he&amp;#39;s an amazing psychologist and really does a nice job of addressing issues of the heart and the mind especially when it comes to living with illness and disability and Kyle reached out to him and asked him if he would join us for our Symposium again and he immediately said yes so we are really excited to have Dr Gottlieb back this year and then we&amp;#39;ll have breakout sessions in the afternoon where you&amp;#39;ll be able to go to two of the three breakouts and those um you know we&amp;#39;ve got short descriptions on the agenda for you but you can learn more about advocacy um we&amp;#39;ve got one that&amp;#39;s going to be a peer-led group on emotional health and then we&amp;#39;re going to have another one focused on managing your care and so hopefully there&amp;#39;s something in the agenda today for everyone because we&amp;#39;ve covered a wide range of topics and we&amp;#39;ll come back here at the end like I said um for some final q a and some wrap-up comments I just want to take a minute to recognize our sponsors many of them are here today in fact um would any of or any of our sponsors who are in the room can you please stand because I really want to make sure that the community knows who you are and gets a chance to meet with you and just thank you [Applause] many of our sponsors are participating in the program today but also because of their support we&amp;#39;re able to offer the symposium free of charge no registration fee and that&amp;#39;s been an important goal for us we don&amp;#39;t want to have barriers to participation so we have a request of all of you next month we have the fair energy ball we are in high fundraising season even though we had an amazing ride Ataxia yesterday with outstanding fundraising yeah we&amp;#39;re not going to stop there we have the energy ball in Tampa Florida October 15th this is the biggest fundraiser we have every year the energy ball raises close to two million dollars and that is incredibly important for us in terms of uh being able to fund a lot of research and so we are asking any of you who have a few minutes today to help us by filling out a short postcard where you can just write a message to one of the energy ball supporters so that when they arrive at the energy ball they&amp;#39;re sitting down at their table there&amp;#39;s a little note from someone in our community you know saying thank you really connecting them to the help that they bring to to our mission and to to our community so those postcards are out at the registration desk if you just get one or two of them and fill it out that would be terrific all right so before we get the first panel started I wanted to let you know about a project that&amp;#39;s been ongoing for the past few years um at the beginning of the pandemic when things started to shut down including clinics I was having a conversation with some of our researchers and clinicians specifically Louise Corbin in Australia and Louise led the first effort to put together clinical care guidelines and they were published in 2014. and I said to Louise I said you know with nobody being able to go to clinic for a little while would now be a good time to update the clinical care guidelines do people maybe have a little bit more free time right now and she was like oh that&amp;#39;s a great idea I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about it well that was not a several month project that turned out to be a several year project but very soon within the next month or so we&amp;#39;re going to be able to release to everyone updated clinical care guidelines um and for those who don&amp;#39;t know the guidelines currently the 2014 guidelines are on our website you can download them they&amp;#39;re about three to four hundred Pages um and they go through all different types of topics but they&amp;#39;re really meant to help you and help your health care providers navigate symptoms of fa and help manage those symptoms they are not intended for you to use solely as medical advice they they are you know there to help your health care providers interpret what&amp;#39;s happening for you and help you and help them help you manage through some of the some of the symptoms that come with fa there was an incredibly intense process and I will not go through this I just put it here so that you know like there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a very standard process where you review the medical literature um you look at evidence-based medicine to develop the guidelines and specifically the recommendations and best practice statements that come out of the guidelines those all go through a detailed review process and this year we had um 70 expert authors from 13 different countries contributing to more than 15 chapters in the guidelines and the authors were you know there are actually hun there&amp;#39;s over a hundred recommendations and best practice statements that go with the document we also had new this time invited 11 individuals who are living with fa to help provide feedback on the development of the topics that got covered in the guidelines and lay summaries that were prepared of the recommendations to kind of help you get through this incredibly dense amount of material and so these are just the topics that are covered in the guidelines and new this year um actually from the patient Community we were specifically asked to consider a chapter on emergency room care because people will end up having to go to an emergency room and doctors won&amp;#39;t know anything about fa and so we have a whole chapter now an emergency medicine a digital and assistive Technologies as well as mental health the like I said there are recommendations the recommendations really come from evidence-based medicine and there&amp;#39;s not a lot in FA um because we don&amp;#39;t have treatments yet and so in some places management comes from sort of what&amp;#39;s considered best practice this is what the clinical experts have learned over the years and caring for people and so they&amp;#39;re sharing their expertise in the guidelines as best practice statements even when there isn&amp;#39;t a whole lot of evidence so that&amp;#39;s sort of the difference between a recommendation and a best practice statement foreign we tried to make the guidelines much easier to access and is Anne in the room from the fair team there she is okay so Louise started the guideline process but quickly said I&amp;#39;m going to need help and because we weren&amp;#39;t having any fundraising at the time and said oh I can help with the guidelines again we didn&amp;#39;t quite know what we were getting ourselves into but in Anne has helped Louise through this entire process corralling all the 70 experts to get all their work done to get all the documentation submitted and then and really poured herself into taking these documents and putting them into a website that would be much more user friendly and much more accessible so thank you Anne [Applause] um I&amp;#39;m not going to go through it in too much detail but there&amp;#39;s a search bar so for example if you search the symptoms spasticity you get right away the five topics that cover spasticity in different aspects there is a table of contents and so you can quickly go through the table of contents and not only for each of the chapters but every topic in the chapter that gets covered there is the Emergency Care chapter is on every page in Red so you can easily find it there&amp;#39;s um navigation across the top of every page that kind of helps you move through each of the chapters and the topic so you can quickly just get to hopefully what you&amp;#39;re looking for and just narrow down on that and you&amp;#39;re not you know currently you&amp;#39;ve got to go through this 350 page document to find exactly where you&amp;#39;re going trying to find it as one single PDF every single chapter can be downloaded as individual PDFs if you&amp;#39;re like me and you still like paper and don&amp;#39;t like to navigate on everything online you can download individual chapter PDFs and then the lay summaries and you know everything&amp;#39;s right there you can just quickly find what you&amp;#39;re looking for so this information is going to be coming out like I said in about a month you&amp;#39;ll get an email from Farrah we&amp;#39;re just now waiting for the final peer review of the paper publication to make sure it gets into the medical domain so once it gets into the medical domain we can share it more broadly if we share it more broadly ahead of that time then it won&amp;#39;t get accepted because it&amp;#39;s publicly available so but it should only be about another month but I wanted to make sure you knew this was coming and once you see the announcement now you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll know what that&amp;#39;s all about so with that I think we&amp;#39;re ready to get the first session started so if Dr Lynch and Dr McCormick can come up that&amp;#39;d be great um in our first session like I said we&amp;#39;re going to talk about clinical management and many I think everybody here hopefully knows Dr Lynch from the Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia and the director of the FAA program and the center of excellence we also have Dr Artie Patel who&amp;#39;s a cardiologist from the University of South Florida and she&amp;#39;s going to join us virtually um there is a hurricane coming to South Florida and so it&amp;#39;s probably very good that she&amp;#39;s joining us remotely today and then Dr McCormick from the center of excellence she&amp;#39;s a pediatric endocrinologist is also going to join us so with that I will turn it over to you thanks I presume this works the same way they all do great so can all right okay great so I can see my slides many people have heard me talk on this topic before sometimes in this very Forum most people probably don&amp;#39;t need to be reminded that I have an international reputation for speaking very very fast I will try and slow down today but if you know you get into the topic you just get rolling sometime and plus you know we got lots of other things to talk about they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re good to see there&amp;#39;s so many new people a lot of this will be review for some but there will be other individuals for whom this is uh new so let&amp;#39;s talk a little bit about free record taxi in general and then the neurological and other brain manifestations of fa so fa is a rare genetic Progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting roughly 1 in 50 000 to 100 000 people in the United States so uh one fifty thousand to a hundred thousand people so about four to five thousand people in the United States is the rough estimate and then 15 to 20 000 worldwide uh the usual presentation involves neurological events either a taxi or spasticity and if you have fa and live long enough you will have neurological features they are 100 penetrant however fa we always have to remember is a multi-system disease affecting a variety of other organs uh not only from a marker perspective but also from a clinical perspective there is genotypic in other words referring to the mutation of the Gene and phenotypic referring to what people how people manifest heterogeneity not everyone is alike the biggest heterogeneous in age of onset were childhood onset is most common and is associated with a more rapid progression onset is usually between ages 5 and 15 in childhood although it could go be at any age and the mean if you look median if you look across the large natural history study is around age uh 10 for age of onset by late teens these individuals or early 20s they&amp;#39;ll be using wheelchair assistance and having issues with their activities of daily living in contrast late onset which is sort of everyone after 15 but by definition late onset refers to individuals who have onset at age 25 or after is milder and we can statistically show that it&amp;#39;s associated with a slower progression and a milder phenotype frequently lacking the sensory abnormality it&amp;#39;s an almost uniformly lacking cardiac abnormalities and scoliosis so I&amp;#39;ll repeat myself at times just to be sure that people get some things again it&amp;#39;s autosomal recessive each parent is a carrier but they manifest no symptoms of the disease if people would like to talk details on why that has occurred I&amp;#39;d advise you to talk to Lane rodden as you said with her at lunch or whatever and she can answer them now better than I could uh the prevalence again 140 000 a Caucasian the carrier frequency in the United States population of about one in a hundred so as you look around people here who have no relationship to anyone with fa let&amp;#39;s say there are 50 within this room roughly one half of a person is a random carrier of fa and they are occasionally discovered uh coincidentally signs and symptoms so remember a sign is anything a physician observes a symptom is anything a patient reports Ataxia difficulty with balance and difficulty coordination nice fancy word for something which is uh relatively simple dysarthria difficulty speaking referring to the articulation of words not referring to thinking of it a reflexia a fancy name for saying we tap on your deep tendons and they don&amp;#39;t move is this important only the neurologist in all honesty uh sensory loss usually in FA it&amp;#39;s mainly no proprioception knowing where your limbs or your digits are in space and vibration we call these discriminative Sensations and they sort of allow you to know how your limbs are moving and thus they contribute to Ataxia and finally muscle weakness but the weakness doesn&amp;#39;t involve the generation of muscle as it muches involves the muscle not working right cognition is relatively spared in FA you will read on occasion articles about cognition and F A it&amp;#39;s a tough thing to evaluate and most of it is most important from a research perspective rather than from a clinical perspective uh if we look at tissue from people loss of some very specific places the sensation in what we call the dorsal columns which are from the spinal cord the dorsal ganging themselves which give rise to this I&amp;#39;ll come back to that loss of the pathways that take that sensory information into the cerebellum which you may know is the area which controls balance in our brain and later a particular portion of the cerebellum called the dentate nucleus will slowly go away atrophy most patients have some component of scoliosis or cardiomyopathy but the severity varies greatly between individuals and at times simply whether you call something cardiomyopathy depends on how you define it uh larger number of people than expected have diabetes 10 to 20 percent early and then uh 20 or more later the later being more like type 2 and the earlier being more like type one the way Shannon will be nice enough to tell us we don&amp;#39;t actually use those terms anymore but it&amp;#39;s giving you a way to think about it uh subclinical myopathy that is to say people&amp;#39;s muscles are not working but it&amp;#39;s very difficult to pick up on exam you&amp;#39;d conclude it was something else in addition we were more and more realizing that people lose visual Acuity out of each eye and in some cases this progresses to blindness this is a major area for new interventions and also people do lose hearing but it&amp;#39;s not the ability to let us say hear me speaking here is the ability to discriminate who is speaking within a crowd going around the table not necessarily knowing who&amp;#39;s saying something unless you&amp;#39;re able to read their lips which is very hard in the mascara it&amp;#39;s a different type of hearing loss than you would see from cochlear disease uh onset the early space that I&amp;#39;ve met presented at age two the latest I have met presented at age 75. people progress on average most people wheelchair bound by their late 20s and the we&amp;#39;re the only cause of premature death is heart failure if you&amp;#39;re neuroanatomist and I know you all are uh let&amp;#39;s see if I can use the I don&amp;#39;t have much of a pointer here the places that die are loss of the large Sensory neurons that control that sensory information vibration and proprioception these lie adjacent to the spinal cord and we&amp;#39;ve known on a long and this gives rise to difficulty with balance because you don&amp;#39;t know where the where your limbs are in space thus you&amp;#39;re off balance and for neurologists it gets causes your reflexes to go away when does this happen though we will debate the exact time the answer is early some of us believe that all this is over before we even meet a person in most individuals the second place one loses is the loss of the spinal cerebral tract which is immediately Downstream from these Pathways it is also probably a very early founding based on animal models and actually based on monitoring during scoliosis surgery you also lose and this is something which has changed from the first time we gave this talk 15 years ago the motor tracks which control the ability to move those that begin all the way up in your brain and go all the way down to the spinal cord to control your motor function we note this occurs late and you can measure electrical potentials or a motor of Oak potentials as suda Kessler has done in our group uh to prove it but almost certainly it is also present before people we meet people based on those potentials so it&amp;#39;s both an early and a late finding and it does contribute to the progression in clinical phenotype and clinical abilities you also loses the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum which is a very small control nucleus in the cerebellum which gives rise to all the output of the cerebellum this goes away late one of the questions is whether it&amp;#39;s dysfunctional earlier I mentioned you lose vision and hearing to some degree in the hearing it&amp;#39;s actually within the brain stem that you lose cell in the vision it&amp;#39;s within the retina many of you all who have visited us recently uh will take a snapshot of your uh back of your retina to measure how thick it is and we believe we can use this as a predictor of How likely people are to lose vision over time Lane will be writing that data up after she gets done answering your questions from lunch uh so give her a break here so she gets it done uh relatively spirit is here we call the cerebellar cortex with a large purkinje cells although we think they may be involved but simply not die they are dysfunctional but not that dead that is important because dysfunctional cells are much more rescuable than dead cells to which you would probably say duh uh and the cerebral cortex where we do much of our thinking is relatively spared I didn&amp;#39;t say completely but relatively spirit so people have the sensory normal condition for the activities of daily life I will uh other things should be brought out in testing but for daily life people generally do fine with the cognition aspect so it&amp;#39;s a relatively few neurons a few long tracks this should be a disease which could rationally be protected events because it&amp;#39;s not like Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease or Huntington disease where your whole brain degenerates this is a selective group of cells oops I went the wrong way so it is a multi-system disorder we&amp;#39;ll be hearing about cardiac disease which begins as a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy your heart is thick uh and then later can uh Verge to a cardiomyopathy where your walls have become thinner and non-pumping you&amp;#39;ll hear about diabetes a little bit later you&amp;#39;ll hear probably a little bit about arrhythmias from Dr Patel I mentioned hearing loss and vision loss one other aspect of vision is that people have what we call fixation abnormalities either what we call Square wave jerks or macrostatotic oscillations you do not need to know this you if you&amp;#39;re interested many of you have been told that you might have nystagmus that&amp;#39;s not true people with fa do not have nystagmus what that shows you is most neurologists don&amp;#39;t know how to examine eye movements so you should basically ignore us uh neurologists don&amp;#39;t know everything contrary to popular opinion scoliosis occurs in about 50 of people 25 percent of people get it corrected it is almost uniformly limited to the individuals who present before age 12 as we determined from our large natural history study study sponsored by pharah so we should give pharah a round of applause for sponsoring that study [Laughter] Jen wasn&amp;#39;t expecting that one I gotta have something to do every year uh pescavis or high arched feet they&amp;#39;re in fact a variety of different uh foot abnormalities in FA they&amp;#39;re only important if they become important causing pain uh people late and even early also have very thin bones uh this is probably part of the growth issues in FA Shayna may be talking about this or not and I think you all almost all know the fatigue no more explanation than that is a very big part of fa and can be quite disabling right now there&amp;#39;s no treatment to stop disease progression their ongoing clinical trials with small molecules and more advanced therapies which you&amp;#39;re going to hear about later today what do we do annual evaluation and supportive treatment is the key aspect echocardiogram EKG diabetes scoliosis of node vision and hearing screen physical and occupational therapy of node while I don&amp;#39;t usually press people on this annual evaluation I have met individuals recently who have delayed their angular evaluations and seen things go from manageable numbers to not quite so manageable numbers so I would encourage people today to stay up on this notice on this you do not see see a neurologist probably attribute to how important people and what like me and neurology are uh uh neurological therapy and what we can do about it neuropathic pain that burning or dysesthetic funny feeling that people get usually distal in their limbs can be managed the best medicine is Gabapentin also known as Neurontin pregabalin and is uh perhaps better but more expensive and more sedating in the old days Cymbalta also called Duloxetine oh I&amp;#39;m so not supposed to use brand names that&amp;#39;s right amitriptyline and amantadine are come of the other ones spasticity when people have it Baclofen tanzanidine and I will note CBD is very good at this as well remember though CBD while it&amp;#39;s there does have drug interactions and finally the one thing I will remind people of depression is quite treatable but it&amp;#39;s only treatable if people bring it up I saw a person four to six weeks ago they asked his parents to step out of the room and he mentioned that he was quite depressed and he said he was uh I said I&amp;#39;ve met people in this situation before and he said he was surprised because he didn&amp;#39;t know anyone with fa who was depressed I will estimate that roughly 20 percent of the people I follow are on antidepressants at any given moment it&amp;#39;s not treatable though unless you remember to mention it or unless someone brings it out you can mention it to me you can mention to Kim when she&amp;#39;s back from leave uh anyone just take action on it vitamin therapies which many people use remember coenzyme q and adebinome improve survival of Friedrich Ataxia cells in a dish what does that mean it means they improved for survival or fruit architecture cells in a dish which is a good thing but it does not necessarily translate to human benefit they improve biomarkers of disease in humans so sometimes but when we do clinical trials we cannot prove that people get better remember you cannot prove a negative so most people logically elect to take them because they&amp;#39;re essentially side effect free uh I remind you they can have drug interactions though vitamin D is something which we actually now tell people to push not necessarily for anything that it does to fa but for general bone health I think they would say that most Americans are vitamin D deficient unless we spend all day out like at write a taxi riding yesterday in that wonderful Sun exercise is very important for people with fa we have noticed this during the pandemic people who stop exercising simply do worse doing an exercise what it is is different to different people the less you do the less you do it maintains abilities and it is a very key feature to uh fighting against depression that has been shown in many studies the specific benefits in FA are two first it does induce a process called mitophagy or mitochondrial pruning where you were recall that fa is a mitochondrial disease in some ways uh exercise makes you get rid of your bad mitochondria and keep your good ones it&amp;#39;s an endogenous process mediated by a transcription factor which you can talk about if we want the second thing is your cerebellum itself works on a training mechanism if someone lies down for a week their cerebellum will come untrained and they will be off balance so the more you do that you&amp;#39;re always retraining it if you stop doing anything that training goes away two other questions which are not neurologic but I&amp;#39;ll take now because I don&amp;#39;t think they come up elsewhere I&amp;#39;m asked very frequently about taking supplemental iron if you recall when the gene was discovered in the early studies we discovered that my iron builds up in the mitochondria of people with fa that led to an overall worry that people shouldn&amp;#39;t take iron well better understanding is that the iron may be an Epi phenomenon something which is there but isn&amp;#39;t contributing at the very least people with fa are actually iron deficient at the whole body level though iron concentrated in the mitochondria so you can&amp;#39;t simply treat the Disease by restricting iron it won&amp;#39;t work you&amp;#39;ll just program yourself back so if a person and if you look at people&amp;#39;s blood values everyone has low ferritins people tend to be mildly anemic not in a Range which causes problem but it will arrange which you know it&amp;#39;s real and they have an anemia which is clearly iron deficiency based on the size of the red cells so people with fa are mildly iron deficient is it necessary to treat usually not but if a person falls below a certain number which is Judgment based on your physician it&amp;#39;s reasonable to treat with oral iron you don&amp;#39;t have to take away all the go for the multivitamins which have no iron that amount is not enough to cause problem I will cautiously say IV iron may be different so when they try and repeat someone right away I am familiar with one or two people who may have had complications when being repleted with ivr and but oral iron is quite safe and no one should be scared to take maintenance the second question from every week is coven so we&amp;#39;ll talk we&amp;#39;re not going to talk politics we&amp;#39;ll talk data uh we&amp;#39;ve seen 110 patients with covid among the last 400 fa patients we&amp;#39;ve seen which is the number we have seen as of beginning of last week uh since the pandemic began 10 people have been hospitalized nine of those people were on vaxalized unvaccinated two people have died both when vaccinated both had diabetes so the takeaway message covet is probably very similar in it people with fa than the general population older people and people who are diabetic like at least one person on this stage and Shane is quite Young uh so if you&amp;#39;re diabetic and you&amp;#39;re old like me stay vaccinated and in general stay vaccinated clearly it does protect against more severe disease and as I said no one has died since the vaccination era among the fa patients does long covet exist in FA I don&amp;#39;t even know how to address this one because as you know people with fa frequently have slow recovery from any virus how do we assess that with covid it would be a very just a very hard thing to do uh vaccination there have been very few reactions a few people who have very bad disease ejection fractions in the single digit range or less than 15 percent from the metabolic stress they&amp;#39;ve had a very bad week afterward again that probably would have happened with any vaccination was not unique to covet uh so I can&amp;#39;t say that I&amp;#39;m certain anyone&amp;#39;s had a vaccination reaction I would be very careful about tossing around the term myocarditis which is given for uh very one in ten thousand or some number of individuals who get the coveted vaccination many people with fa particularly children have high troponins all the time they have chest pain sometimes they have cardiac MRI scans which show what we call late General enhancement which is the marker fibrosis those are the three markers of fa and they&amp;#39;re the three markers of uh myocarditis so you actually can&amp;#39;t tell whether a person with fa has myocarditis or not because they&amp;#39;ve met many of the criteria before they got anything so I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of conjecture about this which is unproven overall conclusion covet and covert vaccination are no different than fa than the rest of the population so treat that as you would have treated it questions or do I take questions later question now anyone or did I actually speak so slow that everyone got everything that gets a laugh Norm yes so on the long nerve tracks so the children are small they seem to be less like toxic and as they grow we know that that track grows but at some point does it stabilize or does it continue to progress so the question is whether the tracks stop growing we so the answer is we don&amp;#39;t know that for sure I would note the simple Act of growth does a couple things as you go through the growth period your scoliosis work since and if your center of balance is not as well defined you will be more ataxic I could produce that in any person in this room even without a neurologic disease so that&amp;#39;s one thing normally you&amp;#39;re we think of uh cells in FA as being the cell body neural uh which is the the place where the nucleus isn&amp;#39;t a neuron driving it and then it&amp;#39;s a dying back it&amp;#39;s the cell body dies so it&amp;#39;s not a growth related phenomenon now if there is a bioenergetic issue as of you might find in a mitochondrial disease then you would expect that the most likely to be affected neurons and fra are the ones with the longest axons which are that one which begins in the cortex and goes down to the lower part of your back which is about a meter long and then the one which goes from your back all the way out to your feet there&amp;#39;s a little bit of here because motor neurons which are the other long one they don&amp;#39;t dot so it&amp;#39;s not simply length although length could be a contributor uh in back I can&amp;#39;t uh looks like uh Tiffany&amp;#39;s mom Joan thank you can you tell us more about the um what you recommended for the fatigue eminent amantadine okay so fatigue is a it&amp;#39;s an unusual symptom it&amp;#39;s very hard to describe it involves uh muscle perhaps cardiac disease neurologic features as well as psychological some in when people have fatigue I do try and maximize our coenzyme Q into debonone on the possibility that&amp;#39;s acting directly at muscle the other thing is to get rid of anything which is might be fatiguing which is unfortunately some of those other medicines were used baclofen Gabapentin they make people sleepy but then there&amp;#39;s a drug called a mantidine which in multiple sclerosis is independently shown to improve the symptom of fatigue it doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily affect any of the individual neurological sub-components but it does work on fatigue I&amp;#39;ll say some people have seemed to respond to it it is not a sedating medicine it&amp;#39;s a safe medicine it was originally designed to keep you from getting the flu it does not do that I would recommend a flu vaccine for that but then it crossed over to Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a useful for some very minor components of Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease or not mine is just going to use this only uh but then in the MS World they found that it helped on fatigue and it&amp;#39;s crossed over to many other diseases for that I also note fatigue can be a very largely psychological and or symptom of depression yeah and how much do you recommend 100 milligrams a day for amantadine you can&amp;#39;t go any higher than 300 it tends to make people&amp;#39;s it can make people&amp;#39;s feet swell a little bit uh done a big deal it&amp;#39;s not cardiac it just makes them swell and you can get this funny pattern called libido reticularis on your feet but you know if you wear socks it doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference thank you sure that&amp;#39;s fine she want me to okay I&amp;#39;m introducing her fair enough okay very good so now we&amp;#39;re going to cross over to the online component of this uh session so uh we have an approach of welcoming Dr Arthur Patel from the University of South Florida today she&amp;#39;s a cardiologist who sees many fa patients and I&amp;#39;ve had the chance to work with her on several advisory boards so now we&amp;#39;re going to go over to arthi and we&amp;#39;re going to remove all pinned videos so go ahead say something so we can hear you good morning good volume okay good to go thank you thank you Dr Lynch very good for the introduction and I want to thank pharah and the organizers at chop for inviting me to give this very important talk on the clinical management of cardiovascular disease and Friedrich sataxia so there&amp;#39;s a little bit of ground to cover so I&amp;#39;m gonna jump right in and get started so what I hope to accomplish today is just a brief overview of heart disease and for you to say taxia Dr Lynch touched on it a little bit and we&amp;#39;ll talk a little bit more about it and then we&amp;#39;ll jump into the management of heart disease and also some a review of some of the diagnostic testing that we perform in FA just so that when you do visit your physician your Cardiology provider you can feel empowered about what is being performed in the answers that we can get so the heart in friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia is important because a lot of people a majority of people with fa will develop some evidence of heart disease and this is identified by either ventricular hypertrophy um or abnormal heart rhythms that we detect on EKG so just as with neurologic component of fa the basis of heart disease is decreased for toxin there are several proposed theories it is a little bit unclear but the proposed mechanisms for heart involvement include iron accumulation dysfunction iron clustering mitochondrial dysfunction and proliferation oxidative stress and inflammation all of those theories um we think contribute in some way but what we do know that is clear is that 90 of people with freedom say taxia will show clinical evidence of heart disease either through symptoms or cardiac testing and 60 of them in particular will develop something called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy so what is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy so hypertrophy means thickened heart muscle and um basically you have a muscle cell abnormality that develops over years causing thickened heart disease so the hypertrophy can progress from thickened to eventual thinning of the heart muscle and when this happens we call it a dilated cardiomyopathy and this can be associated with low heart function um we identify hypertrophic cardiomyopathy dilated cardiomyopathy through a series of specific cardiac tests echocardiograms cardiac MRIs and with the depiction here of the picture you can see that this wall thickening this is normal and then in a hypertrophy part you can see that it is thickened so that&amp;#39;s simply what we&amp;#39;re measuring when we diagnose hypertrophic cardiomyopathy so we&amp;#39;ve already established that heart disease is important because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very common in patients with fa but we also think it&amp;#39;s important because it is a increased cause of mortality in patients with Friedrich Ataxia so 59 um occurring between the ages of 16 to 30 most commonly that was a study by Dr Sue from 2011 recognized this so you might be asking when is the right time to get my heart checked so evaluation should really start soon after you&amp;#39;re diagnosed with fa um what you can expect is to have a screening at your first visit and we recommend having surveillance cardiac specifically for cardiac disease every year you should follow up sooner if you have any hard symptoms in between that time and um you&amp;#39;re speaking to a Cardiologist who I would like to see all you know patients with that fa but absolutely you should see a cardiac specialist for any abnormal testing that suggests you have heart disease or if you have any symptoms so at A cardiology visit you can expect to get a thorough history examination and then any pertinent diagnostic testing depending on what stage of Cardiology visit you&amp;#39;re in so in terms of screening the history will include a thorough family and social history looking for risk factors for heart disease and then we also look for diabetes high blood pressure and cholesterol which are also risk factors for developing heart disease a thorough examination is performed and then lastly at Baseline we like to perform some diagnostic tests including an EKG and echo which we&amp;#39;ll talk about a little bit more later and then some lab work if everything looks okay it&amp;#39;s screening we move on to annual surveillance and at those visits we will evaluate for new symptoms again a thorough examination is performed and then we perform diagnostic testing to sort of update the Baseline tests that were performed so typical things that we&amp;#39;ll talk about at visits um that um are specific to the heart are we ask if people are having chest pain shortness of breath heart racing or pounding which is called palpitations dizziness passing out or leg swelling which is called edema now as Dr Lynch mentioned similar to the symptom of fatigue a lot of these symptoms can be non-heart related as well so it&amp;#39;s important to be evaluated by your primary care doctor neurologist or cardiologist so we can identify if they&amp;#39;re heart related but if not we can identify the other organ systems involves and provide treatment for that so one of the most common uh symptoms in FA is chest pain in the general population chest pain is largely attributed um or a high percentage to coronary artery disease the coronary arteries are large vessels in the heart that provide blood flow to the muscle and are considered a macrovascular disease this is not often the cause of chest pain in people with fruit or sataxia in Friedrich Ataxia we look at microvascular disease and this is the imbalance of the oxygen and blood supply coming to the heart and the overwhelming demand that the heart has for this thank you so if you&amp;#39;ve made it through screening now we&amp;#39;re on to annual surveillance if you do have any signs or symptoms of heart disease like we described we recommend early follow-up and in my practice we have very symptom driven evaluation and testing we don&amp;#39;t order a lot of tests we try and keep it very concise so that we can identify exactly what&amp;#39;s going on so for chest pain this may include an additional to your EKG and Echo maybe a stress test or a CT scan if you&amp;#39;re having palpitations maybe monitoring that with the monitor an ambulatory Monitor and if you have shortness of breath or swelling evaluating for fluid retention and heart failure so I wanted to briefly talk about the cardiac testing that we perform in friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia just so that um it&amp;#39;s uh not so overwhelming and you can feel empowered when you visit your Cardiology provider about what they&amp;#39;re doing so the most common test that we perform is the EKG or the electrocardiogram it detects abnormal heart rhythms and is really a snapshot um a six second snapshot of what your conduction system looks like so it can identify atrial arrhythmias which form from the top chambers of the heart or ventricular arrhythmias which are from the bottom part of the heart the atrial arrhythmias are more common in people with friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia we can also use in contrast to the snapshot we can use ambulatory monitors to monitor people from anywhere from 24 hours all the way up to three years so this silver device here is called a loop monitor and can be placed underneath the skin for identification of arrhythmias both atrial ventricular rhythmas and conduction abnormalities probably arguably the second most common study performed in evaluation of the heart is called the echocardiogram this is simply an ultrasound of the heart and here you can see the heart moving we&amp;#39;re able to identify wall thickening here and take a look at our heart valves um the echo evaluates overall structure and function and in particular gives us one of the major pieces of information that is helpful in identifying how healthy the heart is which is the ejection fraction so this number tells us the amount of blood that is ejected from the heart with each heartbeat so you would think a hundred percent would be normal but it&amp;#39;s actually about 50 50 to 55 percent so you&amp;#39;ll see this number reported on every echocardiogram in addition to that we get information about wall thickness that helps us diagnose hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy we get to look at the valves and we get to make very specific calculations um regarding other parameters in the heart including diastology and strain which can give us information about heart disease even before the ejection fraction is abnormal um next is cardiac MRI probably the third most often ordered exam in FA it I like to think of it as an echocardiogram with a lot of extra information we&amp;#39;re able to get everything we can from an echo look at the valves look at heart function look at wall thickness but we also get is Dr Lynch touched on the idea of if there&amp;#39;s fibrosis or scar in the heart muscle so that&amp;#39;s identified by this stripe of white here this patchiness of white here and then this Mosaic color in this map here so fibrosis and Scar um is one parameter that we use in assessing cardiomyopathy in patients with fa lastly in identifying coronary artery disease we do two studies which is coronary CT can help us look at anatomy of the heart and plaques blood flow of the arteries and then stress testing which doesn&amp;#39;t directly visualize the vessels but we can look at blood flow to the Heart during exercising with medication so in addition to the array of diagnostic tests that we can perform when you go to the cardiologist or your provider at Baseline and annually should be screening for cardiovascular risk and I know Dr McCormick&amp;#39;s going to talk a little bit about diabetes but we like to screen for with hemoglobin A1c a lipid panel to detect high cholesterol and then complete blood counts and metabolic panels to evaluate for liver or kidney disease there&amp;#39;s very specific cardiac biomarkers including troponin and BNP that are have been studied in Friedrich ataxia so troponin is a protein that regulates contractions in the heart it&amp;#39;s in the general population is released during stress or injury to the heart and we can measure this with um a blood test so in patients with free to say taxia we we know that this may represent chronic or ongoing injury um there have been two studies that have looked at this previously um what&amp;#39;s interesting about the presence of troponin is that it&amp;#39;s evident in about 47 percent of people or up to 47 percent of people but they can be completely asymptomatic um a follow-up study showed that 34 of people with fa had increased troponin and that it might be associated with increased wall thickness again a lot of work um to find a clear association with what troponin means in terms of development of cardiac disease and long-term monitoring um BNP or b-type naturetic peptide this is a hormone that&amp;#39;s released by The Heart in response to stretch so you can get stretching of the heart wall and the vessels in response to fluid retention or heart failure um the BNP is released to help mitigate fluid retention and regulate blood pressure we know that in 14 of patients it can be elevated it can be associated with very discrete Echo parameters but again there&amp;#39;s not it doesn&amp;#39;t tell us a lot about if people absolutely develop heart failure or what that means in our patients who don&amp;#39;t have any symptoms at all so once we&amp;#39;ve um reviewed symptoms done the appropriate testing then we identify if people have heart dysfunction or not and offer a management treatment so if you have no symptoms and have a normal heart function there is no recommendation currently for starting heart medications if you do have cardiomyopathy with low ejection fraction um there is here&amp;#39;s the list of medications that we often recommend now these have not been exclusively or all of them have not been exclusively studied in friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia but we know from other cardiomyopathies that these can help or prevent or slow the progression of cardiomyopathy improve ejection fraction so we are generalizing what we know about cardiomyopathies and other patients to patients with three weeks ataxia um if you have an abnormal heart rhythm uh there are medications that we can use to help that we often refer to a rhythm specialist called an electrophysiologist for specialized procedures if um they are indicated lastly if you have cardiac risk factors such as blood pressure diabetes and high cholesterol we know from the general population that these do increase risk of cardio cardiac disease so these it is absolutely important that these are under control and medications are started to Target these so lastly I want to talk about um when as an fa patient what your other Healthcare Providers should know about your heart this becomes especially important if you&amp;#39;re undergoing major surgery and receiving anesthesia or if you are receiving multiple medications from other prescribers and are on cardiac medications so what in general people need to know is if you have a history of heart disease cardiomyopathy what your current ejection fraction is and if you have a history of abnormal heart rhythms um especially for major surgery um we know that the heart and Fa does not tolerate fluid shifts well long periods of anesthesia and low blood pressure this does not mean that you cannot get a major procedure or undergo anesthesia what it means is that you need to have a collaborative approach and extra caution should be taken so that people can anticipate these and manage you appropriately so that you can have a successful procedure again clear communication with your team and this is one of the instances where cardiac consultation is recommended prior so that you can obtain what we call cardiac clearance so General recommendations for a healthy heart Dr Lynch um said talked about it exercises extremely important we say use it or lose it so you need to continue to stay active so that you can you know maintain that eating well low sodium diet are also very important if you are prescribed a recommended medications um there&amp;#39;s not many times where we do in in cardiac disease and Fa So if they&amp;#39;re recommended you know and they&amp;#39;re helping you continue to take them stay on top of your appointments screening soon after diagnosis surveillance every year and then follow up with your providers for any hard symptoms I&amp;#39;m not going to talk too much about research this is a you guys have all hopefully seen this impressive slide on the treatment Pipeline on the fair website um specifically for cardiac disease um Dr Payne from Indiana um recently just two months ago put together a nice review on um cardiac disease and research in FA um we&amp;#39;ve had approximately 30 studies over the past 25 years and um there are many many gaps in our knowledge about cardiac disease and Fa So we we need a lot more studies to help improve that we do have natural history study specifically for cardiac disease in the work and the new Hot Topic is gene therapy not only targeting neurologic disease but specifically heart disease so in summary the heart is important in FA because it&amp;#39;s a common finding and it contributes to increased mortality early detection surveillance and follow-up is key reducing risk factors is important we have many tools for evaluating the presence of heart disease but our treatment is not specific for fa and is generalized from other forms of cardiomyopathy lastly we need more work to to be done to fill our knowledge gaps in research and working on a cure for fa and improving quality of life through cardiac Improvement so thank you all again here&amp;#39;s my name my email address be looking forward to taking questions during our panel Mike back on yeah okay thanks so looking we probably should move on with say anything go to questions so I&amp;#39;m going to introduce Shayna who doesn&amp;#39;t need introduction so I won&amp;#39;t give it to her that&amp;#39;s awesome well Jen was kind enough to introduce me too so I appreciate that and I appreciate the um the previous two speakers so while my slides are being loaded um from an endocrine perspective my goal is to optimize the care of endocrine problems in folks with fa because the endocrine disorders that develop have established treatments so to my mind it is worth optimizing endocrine care so that folks can feel good so that their heart and their nervous systems can function as well as possible and our goal is to drill down within those endocrine disorder to say what&amp;#39;s the right management for folks with fa how do they differ from the other forms of diabetes or osteoporosis for which we care awesome so um for folks who have heard me speak before some of this will be review I&amp;#39;ve attempted to add some of our new research and I&amp;#39;m going to wrap up in the interest of time just by highlighting a few studies related to endocrine and metabolic care that our research team can tell you more about if you&amp;#39;re interested um so my goal also in every time I give this talk is to make sure no one comes in sick with diabetes from fa right because diabetes is treatable if caught early Dave mentioned folks who missed screening during the pandemic who are coming in sick we see that in our general endocrine practice too and I really want to avoid it right so this is a schematic from our colleagues in the UK when diabetes develops and blood sugars get high the high blood sugar spills into the urine and so it produces an increase amount of urine output so folks p and p and p and as a result they become dehydrated and they get thirsty and you can imagine for folks who might have cardiac disease that adds additional complications with respect to the risk for cardiac problems so new excess thirst peeing a lot fatigue fatigue is complex and multifactorial as Dave and Dr Patel just mentioned but a change in fatigue can into indicate development of diabetes unintentional weight loss can also be a sign of losing calories from sugar through the urine so getting tested is important I&amp;#39;m going to actually go over the testing a little preview of what our consensus group mentioned for the care guidelines in just a minute Dave mentioned how we think about the categorization of diabetes related to fa and I really think it&amp;#39;s important to label conditions in a way that helps our Specialists think about the problem right like once we&amp;#39;ve given a label this is type one this is type 2 diabetes then people say oh yeah and then they kind of stop thinking um so I&amp;#39;m hoping I&amp;#39;m going to persuade you friedrich&amp;#39;s related diabetes is share some features with what we think of as typical type 1 or type 2 but is different so our other endocrine colleagues who manage patients with fa related diabetes we say oh it&amp;#39;s a little different so like keep thinking about this because you can&amp;#39;t entirely use the same strategies you might near other patients so um with respect to Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes is autoimmune mediated meaning the immune system attacks the pancreas and so the pancreas which is the harm the organ that makes the hormone insulin that controls blood sugar doesn&amp;#39;t work well anymore typically individuals with friedrich-related diabetes be they children or adults do not have evidence of the immune system acting against the pancreas so in that way friedrich-related diabetes when it presents in children is different than what we call typical or garden variety type one the reason people say your child may have type 1 diabetes is because a lot of folks think of type 1 versus type 2 is do you need insulin or not do you need shots of insulin every day so children with f8 related diabetes often do need insulin however there&amp;#39;s not the same autoimmunity that there is in quote unquote Garden variety type 1 and to my mind it affects two things it affects how quickly the diabetes develops it also may affect whether or not there&amp;#39;s a role for additional treatments Beyond insulin which I think we should continue to bear in mind similarly adults with friedrich-related diabetes often are told they have type 2 diabetes where there&amp;#39;s a contribution from lifestyle factors excess weight gain inactivity and while those factors are certainly important in the development of diabetes problems with the pancreas producing insulin are present in individuals with adult onset-free drugs related diabetes also and adults often progress to needing insulin more often than we might expect in quote-unquote Garden variety type 2 diabetes so when I get a call from a Consulting endocrinologist I always make sure to emphasize a little different so make sure you evaluate that in kind um we&amp;#39;ve looked again kudos to the folks participating in vacoms we wouldn&amp;#39;t have developed these insights without your participation um one of the most recent assessments folks in Faye comms around nine percent had friedrich&amp;#39;s related diabetes overall the diabetes was pretty well controlled risk factors that Dave mentioned more severe disease more clinically severe disease older age higher body mass index probably reflecting excess weight with respect to management many folks with friedrich&amp;#39;s related diabetes are not being offered some of the newer agents that we have to manage diabetes and I think that&amp;#39;s wrong even though we don&amp;#39;t have a lot of data yet in friedrichs there are reasons to suspect that some of these medications may be helpful they also may require some specific monitoring related to fa our Dr Patel talked about how important it is for people managing medications to Bear the other problems health problems that folks with fa may have in mind so I think it&amp;#39;s really important that folks be offered all of the range of therapeutic options that we have in our Arsenal for diabetes with their free drinks in mind I also have found that a lot of folks perhaps because of their complexity aren&amp;#39;t offered the technology that we have available which to my mind is also an oversight we have things like continuous glucose monitors insulin pumps automated insulin Delivery Systems all of which may have a role in friedrich-related diabetes so I&amp;#39;m not going to go through all of the guidelines for intensification I&amp;#39;m putting them up to highlight that there&amp;#39;s so many different options to treat diabetes these days that I&amp;#39;m grateful for and that where our team is looking to understand the the most important ones in friedrichs questions I often get like who needs insulin right so anyone who&amp;#39;s shown up with a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis and that&amp;#39;s where there&amp;#39;s an imbalance of acid in the blood related to insulin deficiency those Folks at least out of the gate need insulin when blood sugars are high enough to cause dehydration that can be dangerous and also acutely insulin can be helpful and most often children have enough insulin deficiency in the pancreas that they need insulin to newer agents that I think deserve consideration in folks with um with diabetes who may meet criteria two classes of medicines glucagon receptor protein type one it&amp;#39;s a mouthful but they&amp;#39;re medicines that end in glutide semiglutid Lira glutide Doula glutide exynatide there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s drugs like that deserve consideration especially in folks who may be overweight sglt2 Inhibitors those are medicines that end in glyphism dapaglif is in canoglyph is an epiglyphism there&amp;#39;s a really interesting relationship between those medicines and cardiac function that in certain patients those medicines may be additionally helpful so consider asking about that if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re someone receiving diabetes treatment we always say for folks with diabetes to be mindful of avoiding excessively low blood sugars and very high levels of ketones um Dave May in research settings talk about the role of Ketone metabolism in this condition really interesting we know though that very very high levels of ketones from insulin deficiency can make people sick and using technology is important so what do our guidelines say about diabetes so Dr Patel talked about the importance of screening hemoglobin A1c and I was so pleased to see in the glossary it&amp;#39;s been defined hemoglobin A1c is a blood test that measures what blood sugars have been over the last three months on average so it can tell us if blood sugars have been running pretty high or running in a typical range A1C may not be 100 sensitive for friedrich&amp;#39;s diabetes in other words we&amp;#39;ve seen folks who&amp;#39;ve had normal hemoglobin a1cs but whose blood sugars have been creeping up that said if the choice is between no screening at all and ahim gumed a Wednesday we&amp;#39;d rather they they get the A1C right because we know that if it&amp;#39;s elevated it&amp;#39;s something that deserves follow-up the fasting blood sugar adds to our ability to detect abnormal blood sugars early and initiate that effective treatment we may recommend a test called a glucose tolerance test that our research participants may be familiar with that we use in clinical practice to consider for pre-diabetes we&amp;#39;re also investigating Jaclyn Tamara from our group the use of continuous glucose monitoring as the diagnostic test so we can put a little device on the upper arm that measures blood sugar continuously for two weeks and we think that that may be an alternative to the traditional glucose tolerance test that most folks don&amp;#39;t love to evaluate blood sugar patterns and identify a need for treatment early um so growth in weight gain we&amp;#39;ve heard a little bit in the preceding talks about how important those are one Insight from a recent fakeoms paper a lot of folks are missing measurements and that&amp;#39;s on us as Healthcare Providers right like in the Endocrine Clinic we need to make sure we have wheelchair scale so folks can get a weight even if they may not be able to stand independently for one measuring height or length in children who are growing or using alternative measurements measuring the ulna the tibia those are different bones can really be helpful in pediatric assessments and they&amp;#39;re really simple tools but they don&amp;#39;t often get done um the reason that&amp;#39;s important is that growth affects a lot of the different problems that folks with fa can develop so on the right side of the slide you&amp;#39;ll see growth pattern so the x-axis is age and the y-axis is how fast kids are growing so you&amp;#39;ll see around 11 for girls and around 13 to for 14 for boys is when the pubertal growth spurt occurs right and the reason that&amp;#39;s important there&amp;#39;s a few so folks talked about scoliosis earlier so kids without fa who have scoliosis and the same is true for kids with fa the the increase the rapid increase in growth can be associated with the worsening of scoliosis also in in typical healthy kids and kids with fa the um appendicular skeleton so the arms and legs grow before the axial skeleton before the spine and they grow before the muscles grow and before the bones get stronger so that&amp;#39;s a unique time when kids look gangly for a reason they&amp;#39;re more likely to fall and where the muscle and bone strength may not have caught up so it&amp;#39;s a unique time to be vulnerable to broken bones we found in our study that children may be underweight by body mass index I&amp;#39;ll mention the body mass index which is what we use kind of in clinical practice as the approximation of body composition in other words it&amp;#39;s nutritional status doesn&amp;#39;t tend to work very well in kids with chronic conditions where muscle mass may be less and I&amp;#39;ll show you a little bit about that in the next slide that said having some information to reflect nutritional status is better than none so we just have to as clinicians interpret it in context adults May develop increasing body mass index with age that may be related to nutrition or activity and worth paying attention to because of associated diabetes risk also um so I&amp;#39;m in the interest of time I won&amp;#39;t go through this in detail but this um the bot the figures the graphics on the left and right essentially show that for similar body mass index which is the tool we use most often in clinic to evaluate someone&amp;#39;s weight relative to their height individuals with friedrichs may have much less muscle mass than we expect that may be developmental that may be related to their activity but when we make assumptions based on body mass index we may Overlook that important fact clinically um so what do our guidelines say about growth and nutrition first we point out for clinicians some of the limitations of BMI and bearing these in mind we still remember we that recommend assessing the anthropometrics the weight and the height at annual visits um so that we can give guidance on the process of growth and nutrition bone health is another really important component of of Health Care and I think one that&amp;#39;s often easily overlooked I think a symposium a few years ago we were told about a young person with a fragility fracture so a fragility fracture is a broken bone from a mechanism you wouldn&amp;#39;t expect right so if someone has a car accident and they break their femur they break their thigh bone we&amp;#39;re not necessarily surprised about that but from someone for someone who falls from standing and breaks that same bone we consider that a fragility fracture a sign that the bone is fragile and from some of the studies we&amp;#39;ve done we know that folks with fa may have more fragile bones and so we want to do everything we can to detect that problem treat it if it&amp;#39;s present and prevent it to the extent we can um by way of vocabulary when we measure bone health with a dexa scan with a scan that uses ionizing radiation to measure density older adults will get a t-score kids will get a z-score so from statistics you&amp;#39;ll we can go over the details for folks who are interested but in adults We compare an adult to where they were at their Prime so bone health Peaks around their 30s in kids we measure bone health to where it should be we think developmentally since bone density is something that increases over time so if the t-score or the z-score is very low less than around minus 2.5 that can be an additional sign of fragile bones that deserves follow-up um this is a picture of the dexa scanning table of all the tests that folks undergo probably one of the most straightforward ones you lie on the table for 10 to 15 minutes and that kind of goes across dexa scans give us some information about how fragile the bones are but don&amp;#39;t entirely capture the risk of fracture um we&amp;#39;ve and we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll get to this um in a second but I&amp;#39;ll just mention now we recommend dexa scanning for sure in anyone who&amp;#39;s had a fragility fracture meaning anyone who&amp;#39;s had a broken bone where we think gosh that seems surprising that someone would break their bone for that reason we also think given the availability of medicines to treat low bone density there&amp;#39;s a lot in adults more than there were even a year ago that we should have a low threshold to screen especially in folks who&amp;#39;ve been using wheelchairs for a few years where we think their bones may be more fragile so balance strength and fall prevention are key exercising Physical Therapy should be bone safe so there are many means of doing exercise and doing physical therapy that can protect a fragile bones and practitioners should use those Dave talked about vitamin D and calcium I&amp;#39;m often asked like what&amp;#39;s a reasonable starting place 800 units of D3 in kids and a thousand in adults is often enough to overcome the deficiency that most of us have so even folks without fa in order to help make sure vitamin D helps us absorb calcium and make sure the calcium stays in our bones that&amp;#39;s a reasonable starting place your practitioner may choose to measure levels to help make sure that those doses keep them in a good range I mentioned the availability of medications and those are really underutilized in the general population and in folks with chronic health conditions so there may be a role for a bone specialist to help with that the schematic on the right shows data that was published recently from folks from adults with Friedrich Ataxia and we also have similar data in kids the blue bars show the bone density scores that are lower right so like our clinical experience kind of aligns with some of the data we&amp;#39;ve been getting in the research setting um so I mentioned dexa scans or for adults at risk and children at higher highest risk and re-articulating some of those calcium and vitamin D calcium we say three to four servings a day of a calcium containing food ought to be plenty and then vitamin D supplementation is something that&amp;#39;s reasonable so takeaway points this is from the ride from a few years ago I get to update this based on yesterday remembering the symptoms of fa-related diabetes getting screened regularly is helpful and making sure to consider their full range of Treatment available following growth and raking is important and remembering the limitations of BMI when interpreting what those measurements show us attending to bone health especially in individuals who may fracture and thinking ahead of how calcium and vitamin D can help keep the bones as strong as possible in the interest of time I may just like click through each of the slides of our studies that are recruiting that are related to endocrinology and metabolism and again we think and we hope that optimizing endocrine and metabolic care keeps the whole person healthy and keeps the nervous system in heart healthy too so exercises come up in the past couple of talks and clinically we have this sense of how important it is Dave mentioned mitochondrial Health mood we would add Dr Patel you know mention cardiac health endocrine Health diabetes you know blood sugar management is easier bones are stronger with exercise but it&amp;#39;s not been rigorously tested in Friedrich so we have a clinical trial that&amp;#39;s supported by the NIH National Institutes of Health that tests not only exercise but also a supplement a precursor of a metabolite called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide that&amp;#39;s important for energy metabolism so it&amp;#39;s a three-month study that includes exercise treatment for some folks for folks not randomized to receive the exercise they have the ability to do that at the end so it&amp;#39;s available to the exercises available to all eligible participants so that&amp;#39;s one of the studies that we&amp;#39;re recruiting for you see the picture of Kyle like top and Center there because he helped advise us and continues to advise us on how we&amp;#39;re doing um I this is a prompt for me to think this community explicitly we&amp;#39;re past our halfway goal in our recruitment because we&amp;#39;ve had such terrific response so we&amp;#39;re so appreciative of everyone who has participated I think we&amp;#39;re going to learn a lot about the role of exercise and the role of NAD metabolism in friedriches as a result so thank you thank you also so much for that Anna who is the lead coordinator is sitting right oh thank you yeah Anna&amp;#39;s sitting right over there and along with Julian and Kayla who can talk about our studies um also about to recruit with Ferris support we collaborate with Radiology colleagues who have new ways of measuring NAD in muscle and brain and we&amp;#39;re interested in you in testing these assessments so we know more about the role of manipulating NAD in FA as a possible component of treatment and Jacqueline tamroth who got support initially from friedrichs for her training is the one who&amp;#39;s specifically looking at continuous glucose monitoring the role for that in FA and how the glucose Trends are related to what&amp;#39;s going on in the heart so that&amp;#39;s an entirely remote study as for anyone who&amp;#39;s been seen at chop and has had an echo Jacqueline can send on continuous glucose monitor also anyone who&amp;#39;s in the um maybe colleagues who are watching online who&amp;#39;s in the vicinity of Vanderbilt she also has a phenotyping study going on there to look at metabolism all right Jen I know I&amp;#39;m a few minutes past but thanks for letting me um share those slides about the studies [Applause] okay okay we&amp;#39;ll try and take two questions uh uh anyone for Shane or arthy in particular anyone and back it can&amp;#39;t see what it is if someone&amp;#39;s looking for a cardiologist or an endocrinologist should they search out someone who has this knowledge or a specialty in Friedrich friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia I mean is is arthi still with us or she are you still there Dr Patel I am I&amp;#39;m here your thoughts on that one did you hear the question I did so you know I think it there are a few centers that have um cardiologists who are experienced in FA and so I think that the initial evaluation and it&amp;#39;s always good to have somebody at your local area who can manage day-to-day things that might come up um often what I do here at University of South Florida is when people come for their neural for their neurology visit at the Ataxia Center we will also pair that with the Cardiology visit so those annual surveillance um uh visits can occur intermittently but I do think it&amp;#39;s important for someone to have somebody locally in case things come up and with the new clinical management guidelines coming out I think that the important thing is having resources um for the providers locally and myself and I&amp;#39;m sure all the other Cardiology providers and endocrine providers in FA we remain a resource and available for for any practice practitioner that wants to care for patients with definite great one more question from someone uh yes aggression with diabetes it I don&amp;#39;t know if this is common I&amp;#39;m curious about this when our son [Music] um initially showed symptoms of diabetes and and when we had testing we actually had testing like before we got to an uh an endocrinologist like several within a couple of like you know a couple a week another week and stuff it seemed like he flipped really fast from being pre-diabetic to like you know like peanut a thought you know like just like filling up his urinal and all that stuff is that common with fa or just diabetes in general yeah thanks so much for that question so the question is is it common to go from like kind of percolating along with the pre-diabetes to then kind of falling over that can happen the reason for that is we only need about like five to ten percent of our pancreas to be working well to maintain reasonable blood sugars so it can be that once the blood sugars start to be high then and and there&amp;#39;s just like a percentage that drops then you can kind of fall off so the importance of the pancreas in this condition can mean that we also know there&amp;#39;s resistance to insulin and folks with fa so well before the blood sugars start to go up we see that the pancreas is having to like work harder so that can happen so it&amp;#39;s great that the reason the guidelines will mention that anyone who&amp;#39;s in that pre-diabetes range deserves potentially an endocrine visit but to be offered a blood sugar monitor other tools to help make sure that if things start to get worse that they can be attended to directly and sometimes we even start medicines when focuses are not quite at that threshold to see if we can um prevent that fall off yes it seems like the first test he was like in the low 200s and then like a week or week and a half later he was like like almost 400. I mean it was just you know before we got in to see the endocrinologist and and it was just so fast yeah well I&amp;#39;m glad he got into endocrine but um just as Dr Patel mentioned like if folks are having those marginal tests and need guidance about like how fast does this person need to go in like those two hundreds um should certainly prompt quick attention and then just kind of a comment thank you for explaining um how A1C can be low and their sugars can be high because there were several visits that we did where we were like I swear his A1C is going to be high because he has like falling off the wagon and then they&amp;#39;d be like oh it&amp;#39;s 7.2 and it&amp;#39;s like that just doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense and for another time but we think there&amp;#39;s a few conditions where the A1C doesn&amp;#39;t like match the blood sugars in the same way and Friedrich seems to be one of them right well thank you to our first panel um can I ask our next panel to come up so we have um many different speakers for the next panel we want to provide updates on all of the clinical trials that are currently ongoing so we have like four or five panelists if you would come up now um while folks are coming up and getting started I&amp;#39;m just going to give a quick overview so um for our panelists we&amp;#39;re going to have um Dr Kim from design speak first and then Dr Yao from PTC and then Michelle from Riata and then Dr Kelly from stealth and then Dr Barth from lectio just so you know what order you&amp;#39;re all going in but please come on up um also just to get us started this is um I think everybody knows what our treatment pipeline is but this is just a picture of all of the different drugs that are currently in development and I thought it would be really fun to just quickly go through what&amp;#39;s happened from a year ago to today so if you were here with us a year ago how has this treatment pipeline changed well first of all if I go from the top to the bottom omevaloxone has moved into being reviewed by the FDA so this is the first drug that we currently have under review for approval with the FDA and you&amp;#39;re going to hear a little more about that today [Applause] the PTC move studies fully enrolled everybody&amp;#39;s in kind of cranking through all the visits taking all the pills and we&amp;#39;re now starting to have folks finish the double blind and go into the open label extension and we&amp;#39;ve also opened an additional study for young children under the age of seven [Applause] Dr McCormick just mentioned she got through that 50 enrollment on the NAD and exercise study and um we still need 36 more people to sign up for the study and our study coordinators are here so please take advantage of this opportunity I also learned yesterday that somebody who just completed the study had his exercise bike and was able to do ride Ataxia last visit and first ride Ataxia that&amp;#39;s pretty awesome [Applause] um Dr McCormick also finished a study looking at another form of NAD in a small number of people with fa to look to see if we can see changes in the heart and so that completed this year Dr Lynch started the Elvis study which is a drug called lmiprotide that you&amp;#39;re going to learn a little bit more about from from stealth Therapeutics but that study fully enrolled in like record time I think it was about three months the study was complete fully enrolled in it so it&amp;#39;s ongoing now with visits and we hope that&amp;#39;ll complete early next year we do have some attrition in our treatment pipeline we know that not everything&amp;#39;s going to work so we learned the results of the retrotope study and that that drug did not improve symptoms in FA we had some exciting news in the last few weeks that the larimar drug CTI 1601 which is a fratoxin protein replacement has come off clinical hold with the FDA and is now going into a phase two study we had a webinar on that on Thursday night and I&amp;#39;ll talk a little bit more about that in at the end if we have time but if not the webinar will be released on Monday so if you missed it you can you&amp;#39;ll be able to watch that there&amp;#39;s a study in Italy ongoing of a traveling with fratogene and Dr martuzzi Martin Uzi they&amp;#39;ve completed enrollment for that study the final visits are completing and they hope to have results around the end of the year design Therapeutics started a phase one study of a New Drug in FA called a gene Tack and you&amp;#39;re going to learn more about that but that phase one study started and is almost halfway complete um so a lot of a lot of progress in a short short period of time this past year for a brand new drug in our pipeline in Australia our colleagues are looking at Resveratrol and Fa and they completed a phase two study in the past year and we&amp;#39;re expecting to hear some results hopefully at the International Conference in November we had attrition of another therapeutic approach it was an oligonucleotide approach being developed by execure Therapeutics and then another major Milestone is that we had our first gene therapy moved from the the lab bench to the clinic and an IND was approved for gene therapy that lexio Therapeutics and Dr Crystal at Weill Cornell have been developing and so there are now two phase one studies open for the first gene therapy NFA to look at treating the heart [Applause] so you&amp;#39;re going to hear about many of these by our panelists and hopefully we&amp;#39;ll have time at the end for questions for all of them I think I&amp;#39;m going to ask all the panelists to give their presentations and then we&amp;#39;ll open it for questions at the end but just to know when you add up all the participants in all these studies that&amp;#39;s more than 450 people in our fa Community Clinic participating in clinical trials in the past year worldwide and that&amp;#39;s a huge accomplishment and have to thank all of you for that [Applause] design Therapeutics thank you Jen good morning so I apologize if I move a little bit stiffly I&amp;#39;m still sore from yesterday&amp;#39;s variety Ataxia Kyle you&amp;#39;re amazing so my name is Jay Kim I&amp;#39;m chief medical officer of design Therapeutics and it is a privilege to have uh you know to be able to present to you today and thank you Farah for the invitation next slide please I have a some forward-looking statements in today&amp;#39;s presentation thank you guys while that&amp;#39;s updating I can just continue speaking uh as uh as David Lynch uh eloquently stated earlier today the root cause of free drugs Ataxia stems from the inability of cells in the body to express a gene called for toxin and we have found that we can measure for toxin in cells from the blood and on the right you see that cells from friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia patients have low expression of for Toxin and in healthy individuals that level of for toxin is normal what we have also found is that treatment of cells derived from previous Ataxia patients can increase in for tax into normal levels in a dose-dependent fashion with Gene tack Therapeutics with genetic small molecules conversely treatment with Gene tax small molecules and healthy individuals results in no change and it did not alter for tax and expression that is because Gene tax molecules work under the control of the endogenous or native regulatory controls in gene expression so here we describe a little bit about the mechanism of action of of the friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia Gene tax molecules and Gene tax small molecules are heterobi-functional small molecules that Target gene mutations in a sequence specific Manner and in the case of the therapeutic for friedrichs Ataxia the investigational therapeutic this small molecule targets the ga the pathologic GAA expansion repeats and on the right hand panel you see in the upper portion that in the disease state of freesics ataxia RNA polymerase the protein that transcribes the gene into the code of life from the code of life to the RNA stalls on these GAA expansion repeats and they&amp;#39;re thereby producing a state of ineffective Gene transcription and in the bottom you see that in the presence of Gene tax small molecules that the small molecule can facilitate the elongation of the fratoxin gene expression such that a an intact RNA from for for toxin can be uh expressed and uh and also via the endogenous control of the uh the the normal regulatory elements of for toxin so Design&amp;#39;s therapeutic approach is to increase endogenous for toxin levels and restore normal cellular function and as a small molecule therapeutic we expect to be able to distribute across the body such that we can address the protein manifestations of friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia across the body so here we summarize our current phase one program which is composed of a single and multiples that those studies of IV administer intravenously administered dt216 of our friedrix Ataxia Gene tax small molecule therapeutic in FA patients the primary and secondary objectives are first and foremost safety and tolerability and also the pharmacokinetics of dt216 in friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia patients the exploratory study objective is to evaluate the proof of mechanism of dt216 and that is to that is to demonstrate increase in for tax and expression and rejects Ataxia patients as you can see on the left portion of the slide the patient population being recruited for our phase one program are representative of the wide range of symptomatology and friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia patients and we require however genetic confirmation of fa with homozygous GA expansion repeats and less than or equal to Stage 5.5 on the functional staging of ataxia scale we are really encouraged and excited to share that the single ascending dose first in human study is a dose escalating as planned as Jen had shared with you earlier and also we&amp;#39;re excited to say that we are have just started actively recruiting from multiple ascending dose study now on the left hand bottom part you see the clinicaltrials.gov identifier where filing for one for the multiple dose study very shortly and if you are wondering whether or not you want to participate in the single or multiple dose studies do not worry uh you would be equally eligible at the end end of the study to participate in a future open label extension study so you could take it and cut them both angles boy do I want to get the most out of this investigational therapeutic by getting multiple doses or do you want to get the quick way out get a single dose and qualify for the open label extension you can have it either way so um it is uh it remains such a privilege to serve this amazing patient community and happy to answer questions at the end of the session thank you [Applause] foreign and I oversee clinical programs for AFA at the PTC Therapeutics and PTC is a company and with 25 years of History and it&amp;#39;s dedicated to developing therapies for oven diseases and particularly neuromuscular diseases including fa so as you can see on the screen so we have two programs so one is a small molecule of the dignity another one is a gene therapy so which truly reflect our dedication commitment to fa so we have been working on particularly for decades with your help your support and finally we will be able to reach the Finish Line in the near future with our ongoing phase three clinical trial in IFA on behalf of PDC I&amp;#39;d like to thank you all all patients families and pharaoh and our clinicians in the fa Community again for your support your dedication your commitment as well so for the rest of the time I&amp;#39;d like to provide updates on our critical program basically the fishery program and now I like to briefly explain how vertigonia Works in terms of as a potential treatment for fa so fatigue is a potent inhibitor of an enzyme called 15 liproxenase so it&amp;#39;s enzyme plays a critical role in a programmed cell that&amp;#39;s called fluvitosis so research work including our research with rotigonan has demonstrated that the inhibition of the enzyme prevents pertosis so that means that the vertigonin may have potential to preserve cells and the particularly those cells which are rich mitochondrial cells basically in IFA and about six years ago we did a clinical trial official clinical trial in AFA patients this is one of the key results from the study as you can see the patients treated with vertigonan had significant Improvement in fast scores from Baseline and they were about six point difference in fast scores between vertical and treated growth and also the matching subject from the Natural History database so the p-value was less than 0.001 which means the difference in fires between this group was statistically very significant it is worse to mention and what Tegan has been studied in more than 600 subjects and mostly pediatric population in multiple indications and vertical has been showing a safe and well tolerated so far so this slides really give you an overview of the ongoing physically try design so just maybe make a couple of highlights so one is about the age range so you can see here the agents are really white and including as young as seven years old another one I&amp;#39;d like to make is about the length of the placebo-controlled phase of the study the fish we studied it is 72 weeks and basically one half years pretty long which allows us to fully evaluate the effect of particular in the population in addition and all subjects who complete the ongoing Infuse three clinical trial we have the option to participate in a long-term open label study so where everyone will receive the dignity for long period of time now finally I&amp;#39;d like to provide update on where we are with the physical clinical trial and what&amp;#39;s the next Milestones are so the trial was a enrollment of the trial was completely late last year and a total of 106 I mean 46 subjects were enrolled in 14 centers across nine countries and most patients are younger than 18 years old so we anticipate to have power plant data in the second quarter next year so I have to say that it has been tremendous effort from all patients families and clinicians at the center and child staff and the pharaoh and to get the study absolutely running and to successfully achieve the the completion of enrollment and the study is ongoing is going smoothly I want to thank you all for your continued support and we certainly will provide more updates in the near future and we are looking forward to provide more updates actually in the near future as well and that&amp;#39;s probably all I have today thank you again [Applause] good morning how&amp;#39;s everyone doing good all right well my name is Pyle Shaw I am the associate director of patient advocacy at Riata Pharmaceuticals between yesterday and today it&amp;#39;s been a pleasure getting to know some of you and I hope throughout the day today I&amp;#39;ll have an opportunity to at least introduce myself and say hello to the remainder of you for the sake of time this presentation is going to be very brief in nature but please come find me after the fact and I&amp;#39;m happy to answer any questions and of course at the end of this session we&amp;#39;ll have some q a so let&amp;#39;s just jump right into it of course I have to give you a disclaimer the presentation of clinical trial data is for informational purposes only and is not intended to promote any Riata Pharmaceuticals product or program s alone is an investigational drug and its safety and efficacy have not been established by any agency including the U.S Food and Drug Administration so I hope you can see this slide okay and the goal of this slide is really twofold um I really want to present to you what it takes to get any clinical trial uh up to speed and up to where Riata is today and so let me just put a baseline down Moxie is the name of our clinical trial and omavalox alone is the name of the molecule Moxie has three parts part one was the dose ranging study so the goal of this study was to determine the optimal dose the most efficacious dose that&amp;#39;s going to work in our clinical studies moving forward part two which I&amp;#39;ll touch on here is our safety and efficacy study and then part three is the open label extension study which is currently ongoing for those patients that completed part one and part two they are eligible to be in the part three openly open label extension study so I&amp;#39;ll have your attention in the in the very first half of that timeline where it says fourth quarter of 2019 Moxie part 2 delivered the Top Line results you&amp;#39;ll see in the third quarter of 2020 the FDA responded to Riata saying unfortunately your part 2 Data is not uh is not sufficient enough to submit a new drug application what I want to point out is in the first quarter of 2021 the fa community so patients like you advocacy groups like pharah Health Care Providers investigators all of you came together to write a fa Community response letter which included over 74 000 signatures on this petition that is no small fee and the yes and that letter went to Regulators at the FDA went to Riata leadership and the reason why I bring this up is because your patient voice is so incredibly important amongst other things that letter helps support another sit-down meeting with the FDA and FDA then suggested to Riata why don&amp;#39;t we revisit the Moxie and omav clinical program so kudos to you and I highly encourage that continued patient voice participation because it does make a difference so move let&amp;#39;s move forward Riata was able to submit a new drug application in May of uh this year actually last year I apologize and we were given a original padufa date so a padufa date is essentially the end of a review cycle so the FDA FDA says once we&amp;#39;ve been able to adequately review all the data and material we can give you a date which says okay we&amp;#39;ve completed our review originally that was November 30th of this year now between the time an original application new drug application was submitted and to the padufa date a number of meetings have to occur and in one of those meetings the FDA said to Riata we would appreciate and we would allow some more supporting data to be submitted now and I&amp;#39;ll get into this in further slides the supporting data that was submitted on behalf of Riata did constitute a major NDA change a major Amendment and therefore the FDA said hey we need some more time to review that material hence why as you may be well aware the FDA announced a padufa extension of February 2023. so that&amp;#39;s our key dates there so we now have a padufa date of February 2023 as I mentioned and if approved we are anticipating a U.S launch in the first half of next year foreign [Applause] so very quickly I&amp;#39;m going to review the part 2 pivotal trial of omavaloxone in FA this was an international double-blind placebo-controlled randomized registrational trial it enrolled a wide and represent representative range of patients with genetic genetically confirmed fa we included a baseline MFR score of between 20 to 80 and remember if the lower you are on the M far score the better off you are faring and we enrolled uh patient ages of 16 to 40. patients were randomized in a one-to-one fashion to receive omav-150 or Placebo for 48 weeks and in our all randomized population we had 103 patients in the full analysis set we excluded patients with pescavis and that total came out to 82. the primary endpoint was the change from Baseline and M farscore at week 48 in the full analysis set and what I&amp;#39;ll draw your attention to is if you look at the study design you&amp;#39;ll see that both Placebo and omav groups were treated for 48 weeks and then there was a four-week drug withdrawal period so a four week drug washout period and then at week 52 if a patient was interested eligible and wanted to move on to the open label extension they could most certainly do so regarding the results Moxie met the primary endpoint of change from Baseline in MFR score at week 48 in the full analysis set so if you look at the graph on the left hand side you&amp;#39;ll see the study week on the x-axis which is 0 0 to 48 weeks and on the y-axis you&amp;#39;ll see the change from Baseline in m farscore and right in the middle there you&amp;#39;ll see point the zero point line through the middle of the graph omav treatment which is an N of 40 was shown in the blue line and Placebo is shown in the gray line now remember the lower you go the better you&amp;#39;re faring so the M4 score showed Improvement as compared to Placebo in the omav treated group and that between group difference was approximately two points as you may know M fars has a number of components within the mfars including ball bar tests Upper Limb stability lower limb stability and upright stability and within those components omav also showed Improvement relative to placebo regarding the safety Adverse Events were generally mild to moderate in intensity you can see most Adverse Events were reported in the first 12 weeks of treatment you can see in the table there the most common Adverse Events were contusions which are bruises and headache if you go down the list you&amp;#39;ll also see what&amp;#39;s important to note is alt and AST increases AST and ALT are measures to determine Liver Health and so when those are elevated along with other markers that is some sign that there might be a indication of liver injury however in this case while those numbers in the omaf treated group were elevated they did return back to Baseline after with continued treatment of omevelox alone and they were not associated with any other indicators of liver injury so if you&amp;#39;ll remember I mentioned that the FDA responded to Riata saying we would love to see some supporting data hence the reason why the padufa date got extended out to February and if you look on the right hand side under what says additional data those are the three main topics and data that was submitted to the FDA most recently the delayed start analysis so that essentially takes if you&amp;#39;ll remember in the part 2 data we had patients treated with either Placebo or omav what the delayed start analysis does is that it takes the folks that were treated with Placebo moves them over to treatment and then we want to determine is if those patients started later than those that were originally treated with omav in part two how do they fare what difference what difference in M4 score does that look like so that&amp;#39;s what delayed start analysis is the propensity matched analysis is we&amp;#39;re going to take everyone from our part 2 analysis and we&amp;#39;re going to match them with age gender and many other factors we&amp;#39;re going to match them to the natural history study which is uh fa-coms or facoms which many of you are aware of and we&amp;#39;re going to match them to a patient in the natural history study and determine uh does and how does m fars progress when you compare the two groups and then thirdly uh of course we need more information the FDA wanted more information to support omav&amp;#39;s mechanism of action looking at safety there have been no new safety findings in the ongoing open label extension study so that&amp;#39;s key to note here and that&amp;#39;s all I have for now [Applause] good morning I&amp;#39;m Gene Kelly from stealth Biotherapeutics thanks for including me in your program today I&amp;#39;m going to tell you a little bit about Stealth and Elementary so stealth is a small biotech company based outside of Boston by small I mean there&amp;#39;s less than 50 people in the company currently we have a lead compound called element protide which we&amp;#39;ve looked at in a number of different diseases mostly focusing on the effects of mitochondrial function I lost my monitor up here uh-huh all right absolutely so it is you know it is a small company and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at a number of different clinical trials foreign perfect so primarily in rare diseases but also in some diseases of Aging we&amp;#39;ve looked at things like Labor&amp;#39;s hereditary optic neuropathy which affect Vision but cause blindness in young men who&amp;#39;ve looked at things like bar syndrome which has a cardiomyopathy component of it the compound has been used in about 1400 patients and the longest on treatment is about four years if you look at this it&amp;#39;s kind of a busy chart but the the most important point is that our bar syndrome program is the furthest along we&amp;#39;re in active conversations with the FDA uh as my colleague alluded to earlier the importance of patient advocacy groups the bar Central Foundation has been critical in order to get things moving with our conversations with the FDA uh but if you if you look what I want to point out is that in bar syndrome and chain we&amp;#39;re looking at those Come Those particular diseases because there is a cardiomyopathy component and we believe that the mitochondria plays a role in that we&amp;#39;re also looking at mitochondromyopathy where there&amp;#39;s clearly a mitochondrial component and also we&amp;#39;ve looked in things like dry AMD Geographic atrophy and we&amp;#39;ve been able to show in each of these diseases engagement of the mitochondria and improvements in clinical benefits so we continue to pursue we have some pipeline compounds as well that we&amp;#39;ll be focusing more on neurodegenerative diseases just to tell you a little bit about the compound this compound targets mitochondria and mitochondria is in every cell in the body most you probably remember from school the PowerHouse of the cell so basically that&amp;#39;s where energy is made and there&amp;#39;s a tight link between structure and function cardiolipan plays a key role in creating the structure of the mitochondria and this compound helps tether the mitochondrial structure back together and shows improvements in bioenergetics it also shows a decrease in reactive oxygen species and a combination of impaired energetics and oxidative stress of are thought to play a role in the ideology of Friedrich ataxia so there&amp;#39;s currently a trial going on at Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia it&amp;#39;s being sponsored by Dr David Lynch and we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re supporting it in collaboration with the friedrichs Ataxia research Alliance so thank you [Applause] hello everyone I&amp;#39;m Jay barthy chief medical officer alexio Therapeutics and I really appreciate the invitation from Farrah to come and share with you uh where we stand right now in this program and it&amp;#39;s been great to see the pipeline slide that Jen showed in the other presentations and how we hope to bring from a a different mechanism through gene therapy another way to potentially treat the cardiomyopathy associated with fa right there advancing oh yeah okay I just talked about lectio and I had the pleasure being here a year ago which I think was the first time that lexio appeared were a new company it&amp;#39;s a biotech company that was formed a couple of years ago out of the work that Dr Ron Crystal who&amp;#39;s really one of the leaders Pioneers in the field of gene therapy and uh he founded the company called lexio and we continue a very close collaboration with wild Cornell in New York we also have a collaboration with you at UC San Diego who have been leaders in the field of cardiac gene therapy so bring together these two academic sources of the technology of the medicines that we&amp;#39;re working on they all feed into our company which is working in a few different areas but leading our programs in the field of cardiac gene therapy is this program for fa Associated cardiomyopathy and I&amp;#39;ll just mention now because it&amp;#39;s come up and I&amp;#39;m speaking about the lexio cardiac gene therapy study there&amp;#39;s also a Cornell cardiac gene therapy study and this has been addressed I think webinars before and also by far in other places so I&amp;#39;m not representing that I have to say the two studies are quite similar there are some differences between the two some differences in inclusion criteria and which patients would qualify and a little difference is an endpoint but it&amp;#39;s the same drug it&amp;#39;s the same gene therapy in both trials since our company was founded out of Cornell so I&amp;#39;ll speak about our trial but there is also I should mention the trial that Cornell is doing just at their site in New York City the the reason that lexio had decided to pursue a gene therapy for cardiac disease within fa and Dr Patel explained this in a lot more detail than shown here but along the same lines it was a recognition that with gene therapy there was the opportunity to restore the for tax in which is deficient low levels in heart cells as well as cells of the central nervous system all due to the same mechanism and because the cardiomyopathy in one form or another affects most patients at some point along the way of people who are living with fa we felt that this is an important Target to treat as it can compromise health status and uh and of course this is an unmet need although there are medications that treat the some of the cardiac symptoms or some of the effects on the heart none of them are specific to fa or really get to the underlying cause of the heart disease in FA and we hope to do that and that&amp;#39;s our drug which is I&amp;#39;ll explain AV rh10f for tax and what that is but the code for it is lx2006 has the potential and of course we know yeah this is investigational and we&amp;#39;re just starting the process of studying it to improve or stabilize the cardiac disease and that&amp;#39;s based on and I won&amp;#39;t go into it extensive testing in animals uh who have fa as it were who have the heart disease in FA and being able to show that with this gene therapy at least in the the mouse models that were studied that the heart disease either was stabilized or improved and we&amp;#39;re able then to move that into the clinic so what is the the mechanism here so lx206 first the mechanisms of of the heart disease in FA is due as you&amp;#39;ve heard before to deficiency for taxin the protein that is at very low levels in the mitochondria in the cells of the heart and because the mitochondria are not functioning normally because of this the cells of the heart the cardiac myocytes are not functioning normally leading to decreases in the function of the heart it&amp;#39;s pumping ability its Contracting ability also causes arrhythmias and so on the mechanism of this treatment is and in gene therapy in general the principles are that you take a vector and that&amp;#39;s shown in the uh figure on the bottom the aavrh10 what does that mean aav is adeno-associated virus it is a deactivated armless virus that does not cause disease but or what does do like all viruses do is that it infects cells it brings things into the cells and here we want to take the AV rh10 this Vector it&amp;#39;s a carrier and inside it is the for taxin Gene and then the virus brings it inside the cells of the heart and what&amp;#39;s inside the cells these heart cells start producing for tax and at least that is the principle and the vertaxin is in the mitochondria where it restores the function of the mitochondria that we&amp;#39;re not functioning normally and thereby improving the function of the heart cells where the mitochondria are located so it sounds fairly straightforward in principle of course there&amp;#39;s a lot and a lot of signs that goes behind it and gene therapy I should say more generally has been something that has been around for years and years now there are two gene therapy treatments that are approved by FDA for different diseases once in neurologic disease one&amp;#39;s a disease a vision so the era of gene therapy has definitely arrived and there are dozens or probably hundreds of gene therapy Trials of different uh Gene therapies going on right now so it&amp;#39;s relatively new technology but on the other hand it has been around for quite some time and people with various conditions have been treated with gene therapy both neurologic conditions and other diseases of other organs of the body our study is uh study lx20601 which is a typical we call it phase one two because in the gene therapy space as in many other areas the first trial is performed in people who are living with a condition and the design of this study is that there are two cohorts of patients and it&amp;#39;s done sequentially first there is a lower dose cohort of five patients in that next is cohort two by patients in a higher dose 52 weeks is the first period of follow-up of the treatment but then as FDA requires for all Gene therapies there&amp;#39;s another four years of follow-up but that four years of follow-up which then totals five years in the subsequent four years it&amp;#39;s just basically less frequent visits it&amp;#39;s really the first year that there are intense uh more intense frequency of visits I mentioned the rh-10 vector that carries the Gene and this treatment is given intravenously like other treatments through an IV the primary endpoint to safety and tolerability that is of course the number one objective of any first in human study is to determine the safety and tolerability but there are other secondary endpoints most important of which is cpet Peak VO2 c-pet is cardiopulmonary exercise testing I don&amp;#39;t know some of you may have had this testing or have heard about or seen it it&amp;#39;s sometimes done with a bicycle in our case it&amp;#39;s done with an arm bicycle arm crank pedal to measure exercise ability and gas exchange oxygen carbon oxide we are also doing other Assessments in this trial one of which is cardiac biopsies and that&amp;#39;s important and we do it before treatment and after treatment one time to ensure the safety of the treatment as well as looking how much for taxin is actually being produced in the cells of the heart and that&amp;#39;s very important to understand the mechanism of the treatment the dosing of the treatment so we don&amp;#39;t undertake that lightly and we of course minimize any risk of the procedure being done in very experienced hands and actually cardiac biopsy is part of a routine assessment done in different cardiac diseases but we are looking of course at various aspects of heart function and ability symptoms of the heart the cardiac Mass strain and ejection fraction which Dr Patel mentioned before measurements of how well the heart is uh pumping we look at cardiac arrhythmias because that&amp;#39;s another feature of the condition and we do that with the patch that&amp;#39;s worn for several days we look at blood tests for the heart as well as the neurologic scales that you are familiar with have been mentioned like mfars so it&amp;#39;s a pretty comprehensive set of data that we will obtain from this relatively small study that will give us some early indication on the safety of the treatment as well as effects on different measures of the heart just to go into a little more detail of the inclusion criteria this isn&amp;#39;t the whole list I should say this is adults so it&amp;#39;s ages 18 to 40. uh who have a diagnosis that Define diagnosis with onset before age 25 and certain measurements that are listed here that have to meet certain criteria to be included into the study in terms of the heart function and heart structure and in terms of excluding patients patients who really don&amp;#39;t have the ability to do the testing either MRI that&amp;#39;s part of the test or the cpet or have other conditions would be excluded because we want to make sure that this is the right population within the fa Community to really be involved in this first study of this gene therapy and uh the last thing I want to show is where the sites are for the trial the current sites and there may be more in the future but that&amp;#39;s to be determined right now there are four sites that are designated one of which is already recruiting so as uh Jen had mentioned this is a treatment uh experimental treatment that has gone through the FDA IND process they looked at all the animal data and said you can move into clinical trials and the first site that is already open starting screening patients at UCLA uh to other sites our Mayo Clinic University of Iowa and the third site at foresight then is Dr Zaza Whitson University of South Florida and these are sites that will be activated over the next few months so they can also uh begin to enroll patients into the study and I&amp;#39;ll leave you with this email address it&amp;#39;s also lots of information on clinicaltrials.gov as well as through Farah and welcome people who are interested in learning more about the trial either for themselves or people who may be interested in participating in reaching out and I really appreciate your attention thank you very much [Applause] well I want to thank all of our panelists um I&amp;#39;m going to just take a few minutes unfortunately Dr Ruiz from larimar Therapeutics was supposed to join us but she&amp;#39;s not able to because her daughter is quite sick and she&amp;#39;s in the hospital and so she&amp;#39;s I I told her I would be happy to try and fill in for her um so that we were not taking her away from her family as I mentioned the other or earlier we did do a webinar on Thursday evening on the larimar program so there&amp;#39;s a lot more information that&amp;#39;ll be on the website on Monday also almost all of the programs you heard about today we&amp;#39;ve done webinars on in the last six months and so there any of these you can learn a whole lot more information from going to the clinical trial page of the website and on for each of the programs there&amp;#39;s a link to each of the webinars so CTI 1601 is a protein replacement therapy so not replacing the gene but replacing the protein and this is just a cartoon that shows you that the protein has attached to it a cell penetrating peptide and that&amp;#39;s the the purple bar and that&amp;#39;s what helps the protein get into the cell and into the mitochondria what&amp;#39;s happened with the development of CTI 16 so far is that we completed a phase one study um a little bit more than a year ago and in the phase one study there were two doses out of the three doses that were studied that showed that after seven days of dosing for toxin levels in cheek swab samples or in cheek cells of fa patients elevated to the range of carrier or into the normal range the next step is a phase two study where they&amp;#39;re going to look at lower doses so 25 milligrams of CTI 1601 but dosed for a longer period of time and so this schematic shows you what the next trial looks like and so you get dosed with CTI 1601 every day for 14 days and then every other day out to day 28. and so this phase two study is going to be looking at safety for longer term dosing as well as what happens to for toxin levels and CTI 1601 over that period of time the the study will begin with just one cohort so one dose cohort at 25 milligrams but because they want to study 12 to 15 people with fa it&amp;#39;s going to be divided into two groups each group will get the same dose they&amp;#39;ll get the the same protocol but just for size management people management it&amp;#39;s divided into two groups so I know that was causing some confusion for folks in the webinar so I wanted to try and help clarify that after the 25 milligram they&amp;#39;ll look at the data they&amp;#39;ll share the data with the FDA and it&amp;#39;s very likely after that we&amp;#39;ll need to go back to another cohort but all of that will be communicated once we we have that information the study is enrolling individuals over the age of 18. again there&amp;#39;s more information on the website about the detailed enrollment criteria I know Kim is here from larimar as well she&amp;#39;s sitting right in front of me um and Kim can also answer questions during the break so with that um I think we can open it up for questions to our panelists and while people are raising their hand and Ron&amp;#39;s running the mic I just wanted to thank all of our panelists I think it&amp;#39;s really exciting that all of you are here all of these are clinical stage programs I feel like next year Jamie we need a longer stage we&amp;#39;re going to run out of room which is a great problem to have you know we know that treatments for fa we&amp;#39;re not going to be one and done all of these treatments are important there isn&amp;#39;t a single condition that we know of that&amp;#39;s treated with one single treatment all of these are complementary and you know eventually as Ron likes to say we&amp;#39;re going to have a cocktail and we believe that you know having a diverse and deep approach to treatment is what&amp;#39;s going to get us to our ultimate goal all right Jake hi my name is Jake Tompkins I&amp;#39;ve been a participant clinical trials since 2013. [Music] um I was a proposed a question by a member of the community I didn&amp;#39;t have an answer for them and hopefully someone on this panel can answer it um their question was if they get their trials their child involved in a trial how can the company discerned whether a side effects is coming from the covet vaccine coming from their trial drug and I didn&amp;#39;t know how to answer it so I had them get in touch with pharah and with Dr Lynch so if we come up with some kind of answer that&amp;#39;d be great so I think the question is kind of how do you discern what Adverse Events or drug related versus related to other things that might be happening for the person like covet or covet vaccines Dr kimiana you nodded first so but Jacob that&amp;#39;s an excellent question maybe it comes that my response comes in two parts we actually needed to assess this very question for our first in human trials I mean in an Ideal World you want the perfect background but that doesn&amp;#39;t happen you know we realize that there&amp;#39;s a substantial number of fa patients who are sorry who are not vaccinated when we would have loved for them to have been vaccinated so uh it turns out there&amp;#39;s a lot of enthusiastic patients who want to participate who are not vaccinated so we&amp;#39;ve removed that inclusion criteria out for a requirement for vaccines now that does pose that question that you had raised um the good news is that the adverse event profile of covid vaccines are well described so uh the investigator can take their best judgment for what had been seen in that adverse event profile versus anything new that could be related with that could be potentially related with a drug so further to your point Jake we have to meet patients where they are not where we wish them to be so um and it does rely upon investigator judgment but also we had the advantage of having a well-described adverse event profile for the vaccinations excellent excellent the person&amp;#39;s question was that I couldn&amp;#39;t answer it like if you have to me all these exclusion criteria to do a trial but that&amp;#39;s fine and if anything comes up you know it comes up you deal with it and part of doing trials but like if something comes up how do you know where it came from did it come from the vaccine and did it come from the experimental drug you&amp;#39;re taking because one you&amp;#39;re doing a clinical trial one that we everybody just cause like everything got forced through like all the clinical trials we do take years in years and years of data collection that&amp;#39;s great but the vaccine just got forced horse thrilled I&amp;#39;m like dude I don&amp;#39;t I have to dance or yeah I don&amp;#39;t know what to tell you but all I could do is put you in touch with people by now so if you could answer a question like what this turn the difference I know that you&amp;#39;ve removed that inclusion crit eria and that&amp;#39;s great for people but like I still couldn&amp;#39;t answer this guy&amp;#39;s question if there is no answer that&amp;#39;s fine I&amp;#39;d be like hey man we don&amp;#39;t have dance for free but if you haven&amp;#39;t answered I&amp;#39;d love to hear it so I know Dr Lynch wants to try and answer this question I&amp;#39;ve seen him like ready to jump out of his seat to answer this question and and I think that&amp;#39;s important because a lot of times Adverse Events do get assessed by our clinicians not by the people working in the company as appropriate because we clinicians theoretically have no vested interests other than to make things work as safe as as possible so there is a paradigm in any study for whether something which is seen we&amp;#39;re not talking about covered vaccines or anything where there&amp;#39;s something an adverse event which is seen is related to drug or not it&amp;#39;s based on the temporal relationship to drugs did it come after you gave the drug for example and how closely it depends on what the event in is it seen commonly in FA is it see never an fa has it been seen before with the drug has it never been seen before with the drug and then we read them as uh no unlikely possible likely certain and that&amp;#39;s all taken into account usually when something and it&amp;#39;ll and how you act at that point as our friends on the stage whoa depends on the severity and the likelihood usually the first time you see something which just comes out of nowhere it&amp;#39;s possible it might be related to drug but you it&amp;#39;s going to be more likely to be considered unlikely particularly if it&amp;#39;s not particularly severe but when you see two coincidences happen with one with two it still could be coincidence with 15 it&amp;#39;s not coincidence so that&amp;#39;s the way would be drugged and that&amp;#39;s where something will be judged if it were thought to be a distant effect of code vaccine I will note the side effects of vaccines are in general extremely well known and everything they&amp;#39;ve talked about here novel drug class pretty novel drug class novel drug class novel drug class gene therapy essentially new drug class so there are more unknowns than you have for a covered vaccine so Jim probably I can provide maybe additional information from Clinical development perspective so when we run the Facebook trial as I describe our particular we have Placebo control trial right the number of patients with large number of patients at the end of the day we&amp;#39;re going to know actually this is really you know because we are blinded clinician blinded during the trial and at the end of the day we&amp;#39;re going to realize okay any of whatever the AES is related to drug analysis based on the assessment as well yeah yeah that is a I&amp;#39;m really glad you brought that up um that is one of the important features of a placebo-controlled trial even though everybody wants no placebo that helps us answer that exact question you just asked Jake because if you have a placebo group you would expect to see non-drug related events in that group as well so next question hi Steve Somerville thank you very much for being here and speaking with us this morning the question I have payal you mentioned the term launch and I&amp;#39;m wondering if you could expand on what that means or anybody what is inclusive in the launch and then once launching starts maybe how long it takes to get to the general population so we can use it thank you sure I will do my very best to answer that question in as compliant detail as I can so what Riata means by launch is let&amp;#39;s say best case scenario FDA gives us the green light for approval come I can take February 2023 launch means we are going to be gearing up our sales force to get out there and speak to clinicians like the Dr Lynch is out there we are going to be ensuring that manufacturing is ramping up of the product and we&amp;#39;re going to be ensuring now mind you when I say this this is also all happening currently as we speak but we&amp;#39;re we also have to be very mindful of the steps because we are waiting for that final response from the FDA so launch the third component of that launch will also be what does it mean for the patients and the family members like you to get it into your hands how is the physician going to write the prescription where is that prescription going to go is it going to go to a specialty pharmacy will it require prior authorizations that whole process is currently taking place right now internally uh to you know iron out the fine details so that when we&amp;#39;re ready to have the drug on Market it can be a very streamlined process to get to the community uh in terms of you know FDA says yes approved good to go and the time it will take to actually physically get the drug to you there might be some lack time so I do have to level set and set some expectations there that there may be some lag time unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t know what that lack time looks like at this point in time yeah Don or with oh sorry sorry my question concerns the two trials increasing for tax and levels and the last one was the larimar and the first one I believe was a um design Therapeutics what&amp;#39;s the difference in the approach between entering the mitochondria on those or I probably missed it so I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll speak to the larimar one and then I&amp;#39;ll let Jay um explain the gene tag so the CTI 1601 is for taxin protein itself so it&amp;#39;s the protein gets made synthetically and it gets a cell penetrating peptide or Carrier molecule linked to it that allows it to get into the cell and into the mitochondria and the for taxin protein over time will get degraded and that&amp;#39;s why it has to be re-administered multiple times thanks Jen um I think the simple way for me is that you know what Jen described was a therapeutic that is that provides exogenous for toxin for what design Therapeutics investigational therapeutic uh does is that it takes a broken potassium Gene and allows that Gene to function normally that is you&amp;#39;re expressing the body&amp;#39;s own for Toxin and so uh you know the expansion repeats that stall the ability of a cell to make for toxin that&amp;#39;s what we Bridge so that the body&amp;#39;s own RNA is made spliced and then it actually produces its own final finish to what&amp;#39;s called messenger RNA that is no different from a normal for toxin RNA and then oh the body&amp;#39;s owned for toxin protein so it&amp;#39;s a the design Therapeutics method is designed to express the body&amp;#39;s own for taxim Gene one other way I try and explain it is the the gene tax um are small their their molecules that go inside the cell to the gene itself and recruit all the Machinery needed to go from Gene to protein and so that GAA repeat sometimes makes some of that Machinery kind of go away it sends it away it blocks it and so the gene tact tries to kind of undo some of the effects of the ga repeat and bring the Machinery in that&amp;#39;s kind of how the drug is is working so kind of a regulatory question that has recently come up with um some of the group on fapg and that is you know you&amp;#39;re and it I was trying to address it but I think you guys are a better panel to do this and it probably is going to need Dave too but you have an age range on each of your trials that let&amp;#39;s say the FDA does approve so there was thick speculation that you can only give the drug to that age range or it&amp;#39;s now generically approved you know barring adolescents I mean if you didn&amp;#39;t do under 18 that&amp;#39;s an issue but I mean if you stop at 40 and your drug trial can a 60 year old person take it and so I just want people&amp;#39;s feelings on that go ahead Jay you know it&amp;#39;s up to the FDA of course and it depends what the data show but it&amp;#39;s not automatic but that the upper age is restricted by the age of the trial as much as the lower ages I think you made the point if the trials and adults then you would almost certainly have to study adolescence or children to have it approved for use in adolescents and children upper age is not again the decisions up to the FDA but not quite as strict uh or operate um there will be when so when a drug goes through the review process at the FDA a part of that process is deciding what goes on the label and the label often is very similar to the clinical trials because that&amp;#39;s the data you have and so sometimes the labels will be very restrictive or restricted to what was in the clinical trial but then once a drug is approved it&amp;#39;s really the prescriber who decides who they&amp;#39;re going to prescribe the medication for okay um and then the insurance payment is a whole nother thing okay but I think the important thing to also remember is for a lot of our drug development yes we&amp;#39;re going to have to start in a more restricted population to get the drug approved and then we&amp;#39;re going to do additional trials even if sometimes an approved drug so that we can expand the label as we can study it in a broader population and understand its safety and efficacy in a broader population and so you know Riata has mentioned that even with an approval we can expect additional clinical trials especially in children and if there&amp;#39;s a drug that&amp;#39;s approved in Children First we&amp;#39;ll Pro will expect later trials in adults as well and so an approval doesn&amp;#39;t mean the end of studying the drug or a complete restriction in terms of access over time Dave did you want to add to that no you said it very well it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a if you go outside the label as a prescriber patient and unfortunately or unfortunately insurance company just a pragmatic description I was going to mention that if I remember correctly we have five silent individuals up here who by law have to remain silent on the topic of off labor use particularly says this is a taped event there they can&amp;#39;t talk about it even privately now if I&amp;#39;m a regular to his perspective even though we study the age group and regularly say okay is this safe and an Africa&amp;#39;s you know on the population if you can justify you can talk but again so that&amp;#39;s the you know if not we have to run another trial to just like genes that we have to open you know expanded age group and make sure it&amp;#39;s a safe and advocacy as well you know I know this is regulatory questions it&amp;#39;s also clinical Development question as well so when you design the study you have to understand the population first and then to justify as I said okay these two key components all right we&amp;#39;re gonna have to um take a break now Jamie Jamie&amp;#39;s giving me the signal where I know we&amp;#39;re a few minutes over um we&amp;#39;re still going to give you a 15 minute break because I know that lane and I can make up a little bit of time during the next session we&amp;#39;ve both worked with Dr Lynch so we are skilled in talking really fast when we want to um so thank you to all of our panelists and 15 minute break [Applause] excellent thanks so much yeah",

in every 50 000 people has fa most people with fa start to experience symptoms around the age of 10 to 15. when you have fa damage occurs to the nerves and your brain and your spinal cord this results in a loss of muscle control causing problems such as unsteady and awkward movements some people describe it as being drunk all the time this image impacts the communication between your brain and your body every web fa has different symptoms so i&amp;#39;m going to read you a list of the symptoms that i experience gain and axia which makes me appear dizzy or drunk all the time difficulty walking poor coordination imbalance fatigue weight muscles lack of reflexes difficulty sensing vibration and feet and legs as well as a loss of sensation and arms and legs starting at the fingertips and then spreading throughout the body slowing and slurring of speech loss of hearing and monetary eye movements difficulty swallowing cardiomegaly heart valve conditions shortness of breath foot deformities and scoliosis now that that&amp;#39;s out of the way i&amp;#39;m gonna do a little story time probably a long story time about my life with that bae and all the things leading up to my diagnosis and what happened after i was diagnosed with fa let me start off by saying i have an older brother with fa who was diagnosed when i was five years old so from a very young age probably around the age of seven eight nine i noticed that i had some difficulties walking and difficulties running especially while i was playing sports and i noticed some things in school like bad handwriting or just general clumsiness so i knew from that age that i actually had the disease because my older brother had it and i actually used to tell people whenever my friends or whoever would ask what&amp;#39;s wrong with you or why do you walk like that i would tell them oh i have something wrong with my legs just like my older brother my parents thought i just learned some of his behaviors from watching him and that was why i walked differently or ran differently or things like that however i knew that i actually had the disease it&amp;#39;s also super rare for siblings to actually both have the disease so it was kind of hard to believe that i would also have the disease as well as my brother finally my parents have realized that there really was an issue with me and we went to the doctor and i got diagnosed with that pain at 10 years old oh yeah and while i was doing blooper to be diagnosed for fa they also found that i had a thyroid problem called grace disease which caused my metabolism just beat up really fast and i lost a bunch of weight and almost died but i went on medication and went to admission so i&amp;#39;m all good now at age 11 i started middle school but my symptoms weren&amp;#39;t that noticeable yet then around the age of 12 13 my senses started to become a lot more noticeable and my friends started distancing themselves from me my walking also became a lot more difficult at age 13 i had my first clinical trial for fa i traveled to minnesota and let them run sometimes on me to gather more information about fba then in the summer i was actually granted a wish by the make a wish foundation and i chose to go to hawaii with my family and swim with the dolphins and it was so much fun pictures at the age of 14 i started high school and i had very little friends going into high school because my condition had gotten a lot worse walking was very very difficult for me at that point i also went back to minnesota for my second clinical trial at the age of 15 walking became very very difficult for me and i was falling a lot can i say specifically in this lighting with your hair you look like a blonde vanessa hudgens i get that on tick tock all the time i look like vanessa you look like a blonde vanessa hutchinson i get that all the time i can see it especially in this light okay i have been struggling with scoliosis for many years and the summer before my sophomore year of high school i had to have spine surgery to correct these glasses i spent the entire summer recovering from the spine surgery and then whenever i started my sophomore year of high school i began using metro full-time and i instantly lost all my friends after that the rest of the time throughout high school i didn&amp;#39;t really have any friends i spent most time traveling back and forth between new york and florida going to multiple clinical trials for fa at the age of 18 i graduated high school and i went to college i was majoring in psychology and i actually started to make a lot of friends there i went to college for two semesters and then at the age of 19 i left college and moved back home so finally the ending to this long and not so great story is i started using tic tac in october of 2019 and in june of 2020 i started getting more followers and more attention on tech talk and i was able to come here on youtube and now here i am speaking it&amp;#39;s hard to say speaking speaking of tic toc i made a video on there asking you guys to ask me some questions all about fa and my life with the bae and now i&amp;#39;m gonna answer some of them you won&amp;#39;t read this but if you do i am a big fan of you i have one question if you don&amp;#39;t mind do you have any issues with learning or education fa does not affect any of your cognitive abilities so i do not have any issues with education or learning i actually took all advanced classes when i was in high school and i was an honor student how is life in a wheelchair compared with that one so for me whenever i started using ledger it was actually very helpful for me and kind of the saving grace because walking was very difficult for me and i felt a lot and got hurt a lot so being in a wheelchair was actually a lot better and a lot more comfortable for me and it allowed me a lot more opportunities and i was able to do a lot more of what i wanted is it hard to be born to understand you sometimes it is hard for people to understand me sometimes i have to repeat myself a lot but when it&amp;#39;s someone that i spend a lot of time with they generally can understand me better than a random person that i just met do you have to do daily workouts keep it up we love you i don&amp;#39;t do any daily workouts even though i probably should i used to be in physical therapy and it actually helped a lot but i don&amp;#39;t cover it now because i&amp;#39;m not really able to afford it right now what is the most difficult thing you have to do with no offense so this question is probably the most difficult thing because everything that i do is difficult um every little day in my daily life is more difficult than it should be so i don&amp;#39;t really know how to answer that question um yeah everything&amp;#39;s hard how do you stay so positive every day dealing with it so i have my good days and i have my bad days i know that all you see is the good days because i like my youtube channel to be a positive place but the truth is i do have bad days i just don&amp;#39;t really post about it but i think it is important to acknowledge the bad days and the good days and it&amp;#39;s good to have a healthy balance both hey you&amp;#39;re awesome with that baby doesn&amp;#39;t matter in your family is it easier for a family member to get it if someone else has it fa does run the family it&amp;#39;s an inherited disease which means that both parents have to be curious of it however the child only has a 25 chance of having epa once you have a child with a baby there is no higher chance or lower chance that another child will also have baby however it&amp;#39;s just really unlikely not yeah no that&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s basic possibility so if you my brother had 25 chance i have 25 chance but the chance of both of us having it it&amp;#39;s like uber right five times twenty five we&amp;#39;re just like see we&amp;#39;re saying so how do i explain that without going in the math part okay wait i have a calculator right here zero six two five chance so that would be like a six chance a six percent chance i don&amp;#39;t do i need to say all of that i was recording all of this okay there&amp;#39;s your answer so how does your dating life work i actually never dated anyone until about a year ago when i was 19 i started seeing my current boyfriend and that was my first relationship ever it&amp;#39;s been over a year now and it&amp;#39;s still going good why were you so shaky on that is there any type of treatment sure much love and respect we love their days to keep them coming there is currently no treatment or cure for faith however they are constantly doing studies and clinical trials to hopefully find a cure one day soon that is all the questions that i&amp;#39;m going to answer in this video but if you want to comment below some more questions about fa or my experience with ebay i will try to answer them in a future live stream see that fa isn&amp;#39;t all of who you are yeah real quick i just want to say that fa is not all of them i am obviously i have a disability and that is a big part of my life but it is not the only part this video was kind of just to get fa out the way so now i can make more videos about what i&amp;#39;d like to do like makeup and fashion and most importantly i want to vlog my crazy and different and interesting life thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed it and if you want to follow me on my other social medias my tic tac is sydney dupree and my instagram is sydney and duprey all of my other information will be in the description it&amp;#39;s not coming out right and vlogs about how i can&amp;#39;t say how all right lip sync with me and vlogs about how i live my very awesome amazing and totally on i wanna make [Music] i&amp;#39;m sorry i couldn&amp;#39;t stop now no okay",

    "transcript": "I have a brief introductory talk because we have the members of the Hellenic Association for a Frederick&amp;#39;s anaxia the carers the patients in Greece and abroad the members of the medical community researchers representatives of pharmaceutical companies friends and all of you we would like to welcome you in this effort that we are doing as The Institute of Pastor which we would like to thank for hosting us today is a day of Hope why because our patients from all over Greece whether they are together with us in this hall or through the internet after many years that they were expecting for the highlighting of their disease this becomes a reality that success of today&amp;#39;s event proves that with Collective work effort targets we can achieve a lot through the brief period of time from our foundation our association managed to highlight increase Ataxia but also in South and Eastern Europe in the framework of an ambitious but at the same time realistic action plan we have put certain drugs reductions which we Implement step by step our association has developed successfully the internal and international cooperations and it is a full member of your Ataxia member of the association of patients in Greece of rare diseases our association also considers extremely significant the cooperation that it has developed in recent years with U.S research Ataxia Alliance which we would like to thank for their support in today&amp;#39;s event allow me to address our patients all over Grace who most of them are at an advanced stage of their illness and as a result they cannot be without here today I would like to address the guys in various saloniki in the island of pakist the island of Corfu commodity island of coast miraclean and Kanye West also I would like to address all our patients their carers and parents who have enrolled in today&amp;#39;s conference and are following the conference in more than 22 countries in the world Argentina Brazil Austria Belgium Canada Cyprus German recording in progress foreign similarly because six to eight percent of people in Europe have a rare disease this reflects to 30 million citizens in the European Union we know these people we have to give some hope and our efforts converts towards this point of course we are not this illusioned we know that we have a very difficult road ahead of us we hope that we are very close to the first treatment and of the disease our job as a representatives of the patient starts now since we have to begin so that this therapies will be available and accessible to our patients but recent abroad we are sure that the state will stand right to the rare patient and show their interest in equal opportunities to all the people I would like to thank all of you and without any further Ado let&amp;#39;s begin our conference [Music] minister of state to address the conference I would like to thank you for the invitation to this first pan Hellenic conference from friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia and to wish good luck in this conference for the clinical and approval of the first drugs that are going to help towards this direction I have sent could sense a big message of Hope to all uh the citizens that they suffer from any kind of disease I would like to to talk to you about the Mrs Mr karadias contribution who is serving this purpose and my hope is that things will change to the best for the state mechanism who at some degree has made some steps forward in order to enhance the public policy for disability and I think it is a very good example of the horizontal policy of the state and it was the first public policy that the new government undertook in 2019 following the recommendations of the United Nations poor at the rights of disabled people and after systemic work we had the national action plan for a disabled people and it was put into public dialogue in 2020 and it constitutes a very detailed um approach with six pillars 30 targets actions that have specific body of implementation specific budget and specific timetable of implementation we enhance all the practices into the other hand for the first time we have close together all the actions that have to do with disability with a central control system for the development of the action national action plan we have actions the activation of course of the coordinating mechanism in all regions and municipalities and Ministries there is a reference point for monitoring this action plan so that we can have the real owner of its body who is responsible and we set up the National Committee of accessibility the counseling body for the state from people from resend abroad of high Prestige that work with intensive uh rate in order to develop these policies we had a wide codification of all the circulars that have to do with this ability let me point out that we are talking about a field where the multi-lose was not a good example a huge effort that was concentrated in over 7000 pages so that its Endeavor is Vision will understand in a unified text the rights they have we already have the electronic platform of accessing Melody for all the buildings of public interest shows that on the first level we can record and second level to improve the accessibility of public buildings although already we have three thirty thousand five hundred buildings on this platform and we have regarded a relevant amount of money from The Recovery Fund so that we can work this institution we have the institutionalization of the first pilot program for the personal carer with 1 000 positions and beneficiaries don&amp;#39;t who is a certified the disability of at least 67 percent for the region of vatica and then for the rest of Greece we have the inclusive um the inclusive uh approach in education and on another level we have employed uh 4 000 pieces for for students of special for special needs and problems so that we can have an essential educational policy for people with disabilities we concluded the national strategy of implementation and we will have the institutionalization policy and we have the unified page of the New York which is the the first accessible platform of the public Administration is certified with the highest degree 3A for with the rights of the people of disabilities and each and every person can have direct and without restrictions access and in the next period we have the unified card of disability the transfer of kepa into modern places in the peace and friendship stadium and of course we have updating of the national action plan with new significant actions every society is judged with the respect that they show to the vulnerable citizens I think that it&amp;#39;s time we have inclusive policies in order to have a Society open and accessible to everybody thank you very much I hope you have a very fruitful conference with fruitful results thank you the state Minister and allow me to read the message of Mr plebris the minister for health honorable president dear ladies and gentlemen I would like to thank you for your invitation and I hope that you achieved the targets of the conference I feel a great pleasure that today I address this panhellenic conference as a disease causes the lack of taxes and autonomous movement the conference is a landmark for our country because it&amp;#39;s the first time in Greece the the issues that we are going to discuss are very impressive their researches and the clinical research give us the hope for this disease the people who suffer have the opportunity to speak in public for the problems they face and let us know the needs that they have it is important to listen to all the problems they have so that we can relieve them both from the side of the state and science they are symbols of persistence and courage and we have to stand by them it is important to have such scientific initiatives information awareness exchange of opinion education clinical research and direct communication with the people lead to the best service and better I would like to welcome all the speakers from Greece and abroad in the organizers that they have worked hard for the success of this conference I would like to address as this conference and I wish you every success atanasius Minister for health and let&amp;#39;s hope that the Ministry of Health will Embrace this initiative and will really stand by this patients now I will give the floor to the president of the neurologic society Mr Elizabeth Professor with huge scientific background to talk to us about uh to address a conference their colleagues we are places good morning I am your most professor of Neurology of the national composition University of Athens and president of the Hellenic neurological Society I addressed the initiative of the Hellenic Society for friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia for the organization of the first partic conference as a science neurologist I consider extremely important the public discussion that will promote the significance end of this rare disease and the urgent need in order to find treatment the presentation of modern scientific developments of the pioneering clinical trials that are taking place globally will offer new hopes to the presence that they have at least they suffer from this disease in order to have the best possible tackling of it now let&amp;#39;s give the floor to professional neurology Mr stefanis good morning you have the floor professional good morning I would like to thank for the invitation I would like to address this fantastic conferences it is the first meeting for friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia in Greece congratulations to the organizers the program of the conference is very interesting in our around the department we have been addressing this disease and the recording of patients from all over Greece and we are doing a recording of incidents on the European Network [Music] we have a particular connection with the disease my my wife is a pediatrician neurologist and to see very often in uh mentions children with friedrich&amp;#39;s a taxi and the burden that brings it to the families therefore all together we have to embrace this effort that is taking place and to be able to the patients that we have to include them in clinical research and to give a boost to results and addressing this rare and difficult disease good luck to the conference thank you thank you professor here we have learned that we must be have the power of soul and I think that has been shown the Olympic winner of our heart Mrs bulapatulido who is together with us with the Olympic winner but also the deputy head of the region of governor of uh Thessaloniki region good morning to everybody ladies and gentlemen I am in front of you who is uh oh and I&amp;#39;m saying I&amp;#39;m standing because some scientists manage to do so realizing the the hope I would like to express my oh to these people who are trying to find solutions for problems of people who while we consider that we will be we do not have any problems the pandemic showed us how vulnerable we are we have constant challenges that we have to face and of course with the help of the scientists we can overcome the hurdles the funding of the infrastructure and the biological Department of the Aristotle University in Thessaloniki was not only in need but it was the need of the soul in order to support these people with the region of Macedonia which is uh of Western Macedonia is important because when you get the approval for the funding it is not the job of the region it is the job of um we have to bend down to the scientists because they are like athletes to win a prize our price is perhaps a medal but the medal for the site is easy to win your life and to win the life for certain people of people yes 35 000 Euros that we spend is nothing but if this helps from a wheelchair to have a child standing up and to help another child to tackle uh their problem I believe that we have a specific reason that we exist Ataxia can only bring to take away VA and bring back order taxes in order to win our life thank you very much and we will always be standing by you the pastor work is well known and we found out those of us that we didn&amp;#39;t know due to the pandemic we have been here for a very short time and we feel that we have been accepted by these people we would like to help them but Mr status give us a short address to the conference please patients above all it&amp;#39;s a great pleasure to host you here the Hellenic Institute of pastel will constantly help towards these efforts not only by providing our premises but um as you very well know we have we do a lot of research for Human Health Services on diagnosis not only the Corona virus but other diseases and of course research to The Wider field of Neurology therefore our actions are very many good projects and I hope that the next challenge we will have fruitful results and to have a note of optimism have good conference thank you very much I think that the scientific Community proved during the pandemic because if you don&amp;#39;t have any health problems we do not really understand how important is the health issue now with the pandemic we all realize that and how important is the scientific community and how we should let them to guide us because with the evolution of science we are going to have positive results and we will give hope for the people of friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia allow us now that I talked about rare diseases to give the floor to Mrs maryada [Music] 95 associations of our associations who are talking about the 95 percent of the people that do not have a treatment and you can see this in front of you when you don&amp;#39;t know where to address when you are lost in mississaugolu you talk to us good morning I am the President of Association 95 with all over Greece representing a patients with rare diseases and for the first time in Greece we diagnose people we I have a child with a syndrome Williams it is a great pleasure to be with you in this Panic Hellenic conference in order to inform for this rare disease this disease which is very difficult to address and for children and adults and of course we have the imperative need for clinical research in order to find a treatment for the people who suffer at this point personally I would like to thank my personal friend Mr vasilis karagias for the invitation and for the cooperation with uh our association we are do we belong to yes conferences like the one today are extremely important whether they are from the initiative of the patients or the cooperation of other people not only for the latest developments and exchange of best practices but because we all benefit all the stakeholders the most positive results of course we have the real needs of the patients we change attitude and we enhance cooperation the treatment is one of the most important issue the rare diseases six to eight thousand is a category of diseases which is a H which impose to the patient and the family a huge burden and the burden is in all sectors somatic psychological social Financial educational they so the journey has the the patient has a very difficult journey in order to manage in order to have access the holistic care social exclusion stigma we should not forget that 50 of the population are children therefore we are talking about a very young people and with low life expectancy with 95 percent of this disease is not having a treatment we understand that The Continuous Care of the patients and the daily fight to survive exhaust the patient himself and their family cooperation is of all the stakeholders I got the Academia the pharmaceutical industry the society scientists health professionals you know so that we can invest into research we are here and I am really relieved at the turning point where we can cooperate and we have a golden opportunity to explore it fully what the pandemic taught to us and perhaps within the time not to lose person to invest today in what makes the unique hope for the rare diseases research development of therapies drugs in order to reach the patient I would like to wish you good luck in the conference and I expect with great interest in the speeches of the foreign scientists and the patients thank you very much thank you they are married and now at this point I would like to welcome our first panel welcome coaches and Mrs karadema Mr Alexis to take their seats in the panel give us one minute can you hear us I don&amp;#39;t know whether you can hear us good morning I don&amp;#39;t know whether you can hear me yes perfectly I know that you had a very difficult day and I know that you tried very hard to be together with us today and thank you very much for it foreign I would like to welcome you to this first session the panel discussion starting allow me to congratulate it Helen Association for Ataxia Frederick and Mr karagias personally for the organization of this conference and conquerors which is necessary and required today because there are radical developmental um progress this and the emerging treatments imposed that all the involved the parties they work together Physicians their patients estate and I think that this is a very clear and the perfect structure of today&amp;#39;s conferences so let&amp;#39;s start asking the question what is the Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia first of all it is a rare decision a disease that affects one in 50 000 people but the carriers of the disease are many more one to seven or 90 people it is considered a classic degenerative disease with very specific characteristics either we talk about the century um situation and state or the movement of also there are some classes of the classical phenotype and we also have myocardiopathy scoliosis diabetes and other manifestations as well foreign I mentioned that we&amp;#39;re talking about the neurodegenerative disease but from a clinical point of view many times it is a classified along with the um diseases foreign dystrophy Etc are aggressive in the beginning but in Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia this is something later during adolescence and the progress is not so fast the pulmonary function is a problem with the other dystrophies but later on in a Frederick&amp;#39;s attraction so there are specific differences here but there is also a common characteristic and this is that you know in these neuromuscular diseases the cooperation between many Specialties require that this is something that has been set out in the in the guidelines about the Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia this is something that we have to talk about today whether all these guidelines are applied for the benefit of our patients another characteristic is the age of one sector most of the patients with Frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia are at the age of five or later on there are some patients that the onset of the disease is earlier than five years of age 80 to 90 percent of the patients we have the onset of the disease in the period from 5 to 20 years old so practically what does this mean it means that we need a treatment that practically addresses um all the age Spectrum it means that the patients yesterday are going to live with this disease from the child the lessons to adulthood they are going to go to primary education secondary education University try to find work in these phases of their life they are going to create a specific treatment that what is this a specific treatment this is something that we are going to talk about the English and first person I would like you to ask a miss and dinoplus and here is neurology hospital to take the floor and talk to us about the beginning of this disease Mr dinoplus you have the flowers please unmute and also share the screen and actually earlier okay hello thank you very much Mr karadas for the invitation it is a conference as I heard from the people that practically deal with this neurodegenerative disease and I admire because every day we talk with families that have a children with a neurodegenerative diseases and I really hope that at the end of this conference we are going to have a fruitful conclusion of fruitful findings that are going to help these patients [Music] I&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about childhood the diseasing childhood and some clinical characteristics model because we are experiencing some very good days that we see this they say that in the past uh could not be treated or curable and could lead to death and nowadays we say that there are molecular techniques of genetic processing that plus practically contains the morbidities landscape and I really believe that very soon something will arise for prediction this is why my presentation is going to be a review of the primary times we see that the technology is a design system the earlier that we can apply this genetic treatment the better for the patient so the early diagnosis at the point that the child does not so many symptoms we have an accumulation practically avoided signs the symptoms of Mobility skills it&amp;#39;s not I like the other neuromuscular diseases here we have some introductory notes we were talking about the known old disease in the German and hollow&amp;#39;s Frederick then described for the first time on the symptoms as we know they&amp;#39;re much more details it&amp;#39;s practically due to effects and accommodations of kratoxinia and that this Gene can be expressed in the cerebellum is final called Harga muscle pancreas satisfying and we have the various symptoms of the disease and in contrast to other diseases that practice is genetically are due to so a similar situations Dia uh three nucleotide expansions in England one of things are a bit different than here products which is the protein that is a regulator practically the nuclear symptoms foreign foreign [Music] and we see that progressively this child although could do all these things in the past and now she cannot control tries to adjust to the difficulties that are presented there and here you will have the attraction that we see established slowly difficulties and at the same time century because we can see that very often here we have the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia the acronym is sorrow it is used the biology Nation itself and it is used to recognize the disease we use this tool this instrument for our patients with Ataxia and of course patients with a Friedrich Ataxia there are other specifications and let&amp;#39;s see this situation here you can see a tribe the way that uh practically the child does not fall down very quickly walks but there is something in his gate it&amp;#39;s not normal sometimes it goes towards the corner or a table cannot turn away [Music] sometimes to have this type of walking something that cannot be achieved when we have the ataxia very difficult for the child to do it and in this way we assess the gate the water another way to assess is The Stance the posture of the body um essence with a wide support base we have the grade 10. and we see whether a child can understand them in this way for 10 seconds as in this case you can see that it&amp;#39;s very difficult things to become more difficult when we ask the child to join the two feet together in this case there is no child can stand upright foreign in the beginning is not affected but later on it is affected we say that the child here is not affected in the sitting position normal taking position no difficulties and the assessment of the speech is important speech disturbance is very important the third speech we ask the child to talk and we can see that there is a nausea in many cases then we go the finger Chasers we call it the as you can see here where the child is asked to do specific movements and we measure this material in this case there is Disneyland that is lower than five centimeters in the nose finger tester in this faster we can assess this Matrix again but also tremor another text here&amp;#39;s the test of fast alternating hand movement you see that there are slow movements in many cases and in this case we see that it is slightly irregular Marcia and another test quite difficult to be performed by children slide where the attack have this pathological abnormal manifestation in this way we examine children and we can easily see if there are some early forms of attacks here because as I said it is a very important to have an early diagnosis because sooner or later we are going to have some kind of treatments and we are going to hear to some Specialists later on about the possible treatment for the attacks here or summer good results and stabilization in these tests we really hope that the gene treatment or a genetic Gene modification treatment will address the problem in a more functional way and after the early diagnosis by the patriotisms as I said before that the neuro degeneration was not progressed I would be able to treat them [Music] for this very informative presentation we gave us a brief and full picture of this disease it is a degenerative disease and it is a very important to have the opinion of a physician for the adult patients as well and this is why we&amp;#39;re going to have Mr kuchis with us foreign thank you very much for the invitation and I feel extremely I think that too many patients here which are Greek speaking and it for some of them it might not be ideal so since you have this concomitant translation I would switch to Greek um sorry about this okay um good morning I&amp;#39;m very glad to see so many people here in the room with a families and patients I come from the beginning Hospital together with for many years managing the genetic Department of the hospital I&amp;#39;m going to mention two more things since 2017 at Regina hospital we are participating in this European registry and we see the patients prospectively we have this follow-up trying to be closer to the European activities and actions trying it to have our patients in studies and trials and have access to various other answers of it um recognized as the center of rare disease is neurological disease we are a member of the European reference Network and Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia is immature the the in the diseases that have been certified with this air framework as a layer a hereditary axis and this is going to help our patients in the future this is the structure of my speech it&amp;#39;s quite brief the introductory elements have already been said I don&amp;#39;t want to hire you by saying the same things again and again just two clinical points perhaps to be underlined for the neurologists I&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about the epidemiology in Greece as these data have been collected there for 25 years in the clinic every brief picture of the clinical progress of the great patients we&amp;#39;re going to see very briefly the algorithms that we use but of course genetic and molecular approaches is going to be touched upon by Mrs karadima later on was the first one to describe the disease the German and very soon he had restored that it was a hereditary disease in 1996 the gene was discovered let&amp;#39;s say here that Christians expansion that the lead set the loss of movement the two Ali Loma we have the symptoms if the gene is inherited from the two uh parents residual as you can see here that&amp;#39;s the two passenger of all their taxes foreign but of course this is not something specific about the clinical picture I&amp;#39;m not going to spend much time here mean the first symptom may not be neurological one in 50 patients the first thing that the experiences is perhaps uh cardiac and this is the cardiologists but in the majority the first symptom is the problems of walking also the characteristics is the sensory cerebellar Ataxia from the beginning not just the cerebellar we have a mixed and this means something practical for the neurologists as well and the first years usually do not have a cerebellar atrophy that cannot be seen in the MRI and this means that sometimes the diagnosis is not the specific cerebellar atrophy comes later on in this decision yes there is a percentage of a typical form say the great patience again to 15 of the patients the disease has started later than 25 years of age and progress is slowly and this is related to the number of repetitions of their legislative smaller than two other in there now I think uh hospital we said that 1996 regime was found in 1997 we tried to have the first molecular diagnosis 1997. 2000 2021 92 series of patients representing families of patients where we have residual manifestations ataxia half of them and we see the incidence of this action the great population all these years here here the laboratory with your assistance of diagnosis diagnosed 100 and 111 patients I want to stress that the neurogenetic unit has been the only laboratory in the public health system that continuously ongoing without interruptions offers a molecular diagnosis and I believe that or we have patience in the first years patients used to go to cybers to Cyprus but in the last 10 years hour United our Clinic plays the most important role and here you can see the cases based on the residents of the patients can be found all over the territory of Greece at least according to the data that we have in a study performed some years ago we tried to see whether some regions so higher prevalence there was the idea that this is the Asian Islands the region of Brazilian Island specifically the islands of the Korean military was very prevalent in the island of Milos but had the disease was expressed in the children so we believe that there is a an increased incident in silence for the clinical picture of the patients slide this is a very busy slide based on 111 patients a diet moved in the last 24 years the gender is as you can see why didn&amp;#39;t we average age that we see the patient is around the age of 25 but many of them had already been diagnosed by children&amp;#39;s neurologists around the age of 15 we have the onset of these days 12 to 13 percent of the patients have a late manifestation on top of the disease you can see that they gave the symptom is for all the patients Babinski tiny here as the disease progresses we have a paralysis of the lenses immune at a certain degree this is a screenshot of the patients when we show them but we have to follow up the patients and the years to come data here in patients that we have followed up for at least three years in there we see that this scale presented to you by blister foreign publication [Music] the speed of progress that depends whether the patients are ambulatory or not the age but I think more or less the conclusion is that our patients are the same with the European patients 26 patients will have included in Vegas a satisfactory number of patients and I really hope that in the future we are going to have more patients in infection a few words about the suspicion when you become suspicious that this diagnosis should be made apart from the medical history of the family um sometimes we have parents that come from the same Village or Ataxia has been manifested in a child another child of the family Mrs paradima is going to talk to you about this movement but in sporadic at access as well we thought before the age of 25 foreign that have announced foreign disease fxn is a gene responsibility and the repetition of this regime the more frequent attacks with an early onset to the prevalence is one in 100 000 patients it is the clinical picture of the patients in Greece does not differ from other European patients certainly for example and we must suspect that something is wrong what we see patients with some specific symptoms after excluding other causes I would like to conclude my speech here you see the key members of our Clinic thank you very much thank you Mr coaches for this comprehensive presentation that is his face on their experience and I think it was very appropriate and the role that they have played in the diagnosis of ataxia unfortunately there is no time for questions perhaps at the end of the session some urgent questions may be answered now the next topic the next speaker it was mentioned by Mr Kutch is that cardiological problems sometimes constitute the initiation of the diagnosis but definitely had a big number of students for patients are the reasons of early mortality is the professor of pediatric cardiological at the hospital you have the floor good morning good to everybody it is a great pleasure and honor to be present in the first Spanish Hellenic conference for Fredericks I would really love to be with you but due to professional reasons according hospital I have to be in thessalonic I would like to give my work congratulations to Mr karachias the president cool managed together with his team to create this Hellenic Association of friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia we are talking about a very rare business which together with the creation of these association with the doctors become better and we feel that we are not alone we need everybody we need to be together and I think what was said at the beginning of the conference is that everybody is welcome we have to fight together and all the achievements and the good results derived from Collective efforts my one congratulations to Mr encouraged yes and I would like to thank him that he gave me the honor and pleasure to be together with you in this conference I think can you see the okay can you see the screen and my slides therefore we are talking about a neurodegenerative disease data can create problems to the cardiovascular this will have to talk about with the neurologists and cardiologists as well and you will see which way and how important is the participation of a cardiologist in Frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia epidemiologically lots of things have been mentioned definitely they are more common it&amp;#39;s more common in question and sub-Saharan Africa Asia and the United States one out of 50 000 or one out of hundred thousand as it would have said roughly we expect one two children to be born per year in Greece when we have a Greece with 100 years per year we expect one or two children to be born in Greece roughly are these in the numbers a very interesting things were received by Mr Goodrich who talked to us about the island of Korea of nature everybody admires the career because they for over a hundred years in the career you don&amp;#39;t die if you don&amp;#39;t exceed the 100 years old but sometimes nature reverses itself it is well known the stories of a pathophysiology of the disease where we have a problem in the gene of horatuxin or products with GAA naturally in a natural person this triplet has a repetitions from 6 to 36 in a in Ataxia Breezy repetitions go over 66 some people say more than 66 roughly what else we see more than a hundred or up to 1700 and this is extremely significantly because the diagnosis and through the Gene and we can see all these things and have to do with the prognosis of the disease or as the the more serious this is more the repetitions perhaps they have one thousand to two hundred one thousand seven hundred repetitions the lower risk number the prognosis is better they are talk we are talking about a problem in destruction of metal holders and the disturbances in the production of energy they are for the mitochondrion and what when the consequences therefore we are talking about the body fingers legs enhances dysarthria diabetes what I would say because I address the children I am a cardiologist that I will undertake a children&amp;#39;s ages yes what we start with with a clumsy child which is Clumsy and I&amp;#39;m mentioning that because in Pediatrics if something is out of the natural pediatricians are familiar and they always have a cardiovascular control and check them there were cases where we had the diagnosis in a shepher park Hospital in Thessaloniki from the cardiological part that is to say before Ataxia was named we had the clumsy child um we asked to have a cardiological check and immediately we have the alarm we have the genetics who comes to get together the puzzle hypertrophic and myocardiological and by cardiopathia cardiopathy and in a preventive um that we may have we are talking about hypertrophic cardiopathy together with a neurological institution that&amp;#39;s how we got to to the diagnosis that is to stay starting with the first neurological symptoms in combination so that the pediatrician who is familiarized essential for cardio logical uh control we had we have the Frederick&amp;#39;s attacks and all the things that were sued by the previous speakers that the age is that we usually see and we have the majority of diagonals at the age of 15. I believe that in the years to come this will be decreased because now we are more familiar and much more easily we can have the diagnosis and we have Gene controls compared to previous years that is to say we have become wise therefore this delay in diagnosis of previously yes I believe that from now on we will be much sooner better results in improving the situation of these children what we all know is that all of them will have a problem with myocardiopathy in the cases where the first diagnosis of ataxia without having cardiological deaths it is a self-evident that the cardiological test will follow which in its majority will prove the existence of a major cardiovas whatever also whatever was nice to be said is that we may have myocardiopathy with the absence of neurological symptoms now how often does a figure cataxia occurs and there a five percent which you understand is a very very small percentage where we can have a Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia with cardiovascular and have a lack of neurological symptoms we said of course earlier on as regards the cardiovascular taking consideration that it is a mitochondria disturbance we have a lack of protein and this leads to myocardiopathy in nurses and fibrosis and we have rarely we can have asymmetric hypertrophic and even more rare and more rarer therefore the myocardiopathy hypertrophic prevails but it&amp;#39;s not a classic one or the inherited myocardial but it has nothing to do with the hypertrophic myocardiopathy or Fitness Ataxia because here we have the intervention They delayed it and we have uh that is to say we lose the um the heart process that is to say we cannot have a data blockers treatment which is the choice in the hypertrophic arbiopathy when we started with a child for example with a diagnosis of hypertrophic foreign throughout the time as regards to the address of the children with this cardiological problems the index of serious cardiological disease mainly is what I said that we have the neurological symptoms the worse the problems is will be and also as regards the number of the triplet repetition and this does not have to do with a neurological symptoms and the duration of the disease perhaps we have people that are at the late age and with serious neurological symptoms but they have decreased rapid triplet repetitions and of course it is difficult to estimate the seriousness of the cardial participation because of the comorbidities the help that we have with the echo in very few minutes you have the diagnosis and now that we are acquainted with cardiac we are very familiar in order to see things more than we used to see in the past that is a micro granular and so on and so forth which which directors guide us better in early diagnosis and treatment the MRI helps quite a lot yes it is a expensive examination but mostly it will confirm to you with who you see these illnesses Frederick&amp;#39;s attacks here sometimes it is but of course we can use newer techniques the Spain weight in the ultrasound where we can detect the subclinical patients that and this is going to help in the future if you do his characteristics very simple yes very simple test so these are clumsy children that we see do they visit us and only from the ECG which is something very uh quicker and you can have the diagnosis and the ultra sound later on so we have a characteristic sign so that you can see here conductivity disorders and this is the result of the fibrosis foreign but specifically these disorder the second activity disorders are the main characteristic now about the treatment there are many things covering instead as a conclusion I can say that in debenham and add the oxidative agent something that we work is the other oxidative is something to be seen later on this is the only tool that we have to do the group which has to do with the transfer of electrons and the restoration of energy there are some results about salsa that we have an improvement of the hypertrophy of The myocardium we will see later on how things will be affected you some studies that have been published with many patients we have some positive outcomes but as you can understand many things that need to be done in order to have our final conclusions I would like to of give some hope some optimistic messages we do not having people the first efforts that have been carried out in mice showed a reverse of the biochemical and the cellular changes in a myocardiopathy but it is only in myself I think that the future in medicine is going to be something extraordinary and I think that in a few years foreign we will be able to intervene in a targeted way I believe that this is the future it&amp;#39;s going to be extraordinary and very impressive I would like again to give my congratulations to myself that today we have the first conference commission rare disease I really hope the best and wish the best for the president the members of this Association we need them we need their help thank you very much foreign taking place we are going to manage these symptoms and these signs so like he says Marius has the floor from the University of creative thank you very much allow me to start with a small story some years ago I was visited by another lesson with his family who is one of the most frequent symptoms that the lessons faced scoliosis one of the most common problems in adolescence and we have the he had the surgery there were some other problems of neurological nature that we detected so when alcohol visited me again the diagnosis was um 3D attacks yeah foreign and became a member of this family a family that is called the attacks of Friedrich and I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Computer the president for everything that he has accomplished today waiting for the slides of the speaker there is always a plan B if this does not work foreign foreign these problems is the final chords food food this problem is foreign malformation otherwise we&amp;#39;re talking about the rigid malformation foreign due to the problems on the legs also fail on the outer surface of the foot because usually they walk in a very peculiar way and this means that there is a a problem that is created on the surface of the foot on the lower surface of the food at the same time not so frequent they&amp;#39;re going to be pain in other parts of the food um the way that we&amp;#39;re going is to approach a patient that suffers from all these problems depends on the severity of malformation whether there are symptoms other symptoms as well from the Ataxia of Frederick and whether we talk about anabulatory patient or not which is placed inside the shoe sometimes we can choose to have a surgical procedure for patients that are in a more severe cases and depending on the spirit of the problem we try to correct the problems that existed in we joined or the various parts of the food foreign International Medical literature the spinal malformation in these children with Ataxia for Frederica uh ranges from 63 to 100 63 dispensioned by yesterday or based on a DNA test in younger children so this incident is reduced practically things that is a higher than 63 percent closer to 90 to 100 percent so this attraction is foreign that have malformation of the spine are not going to require a specific method of treatment is required when we have a progressive deterioration of the multiplication and this is usually for children when the scoliosis is the diagnosed before the age of 15. and in the children with attack before the age of 10. affirmations that we see in the spine Frederick in children with an actual fabric are a radiologically similar to the ones that we see in a idiopathic malformations of the spine and this is something that confuses us that&amp;#39;s happening in vacation practice that I mentioned in the beginning an exception is the malformations that we see in other neurological diseases that lead to the displacement of the body in one towards One Direction as I said 45 to 70 percent it&amp;#39;s called uses it is a very specific characteristic is that we have a left or I could probably say compared to the right ones that we see in other idiopathic sclerosis the specific roles concerning the clinical treatment the um drugs and medication to be used and the surgical procedure that can be used malformations the guardian is used when we have malformation from the 25 to 50 degrees but also in children or other lessons ever are not have another surgical procedure due to the problems foreign control we have an assessment evaluation of the spine because the spike can affect the way that the head is a whole is held and the hip as well I would like you to know that there are studies that show sometimes we have in the MRI the anatomy which is a shown so the city scan is very useful for us for children that have a big degree of malformation and this can help us in order to design the surgical procedure it is very important to have a good cooperation with cardiologists children&amp;#39;s cardiologists that are going to assess the child and give us sometimes we have problems with the lungs as well and of course we have to exclude the possibility of diabetes mellitus that could affect the respective procedure when we have over 50 degrees malformation the surgeon Master be aware of the problems that might exist opinion for example for children about a user wheelchairs Urology problems and something very specific is the apps and so reduction of the sensory potentials that we see during the surgical procedure what does this practical mean during the surgical procedure we have the corrections carried out and neurologist is present in the operating room giving us some Potentials in order to record the a function of the spinal cord unfortunately this cannot be done in these children with Ataxia for Frederick this is something that we can overcome in recent years the recording of the potentials and the possibility to place the inserted the graphs are very accurately robotic epic now uh in these children we have to include every character and when we have um a child that is not ambulatory do we have to expand our procedure up to the hip so that the correct position is given to the child sitting on the wheelchair again it was a great honor to be here today with you thank you very much sir for his uh that said light that to all the problems orthopedic problems that might exist for these patients and their positive life as I said we do not have time for questions so I would like to ask the last time assistant professor in biology and neurogetics I think you need to hospital to develop us the position of genetics and guiding these patients good morning to everybody thank you very much the association for the invitation to be a speaker in the reference conference I would like to ask them and we say we say this for just the introduction I&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about the contribution of the neurogenetics and the study of the attraction of Frederick in Greek patients that these foreign both for the patients and their families as you know the cell is the subunit of the body and we can see it only through specific solution in the nucleus of hsl we have the genetic material the DNA he said DNA is a stored in 23 chromosomes chromosome pairs and we have there the Genesis that have they&amp;#39;re going to find information about the proteins required by our body in this slide you can see the 23 chromosome pairs 22 Auto summary once each one comprises a two um a chromosomes exactly the same and here we have the effects Gene which is responsible for the Ataxia of refrigerator here we see the fatroxine beam fiber the boxes were codified we have the information in order to create as the flatraction protein between the boxes one and two the actions we have the repetition GAA we can send the picture and when we have foreign foreign continue stops functioning products in a protein is the production of this building is blocked and hydraulic protein is very important to have a function of utopians we&amp;#39;re talking about a very small formations inside the cell generating energy when we do not have energy generated the cell cannot function so there is a necrosis there the flattractive gene is expressed in the cardiac tissue neurological nutritional pancreas so the most common clinical signs focus on these specific tissues now and so then mutations related to the disease and with the progress of the molecular medicine and the genetics we can now detect the disease in the DNA of each person so we can provide genetic control both congregations and the normal carriers of the disease medicine especially clinical generation that so-called so from the guidelines of the international literature will be applied in order to detect the errors in the fratraction gene 96 of the cases one and in some cases we have point mutations so the laboratory protocols multiplication [Music] of the region that inclusively say uh three nucleotide repetition or the pixiara that has another access that we use them in order to detect it these three nucleotide repetition whether the single sequencing reading one by one of the basis of the qualifying regions is used in order to determine the very rare coil mutations and in this way to find the computer combine the heterocyclitis so this limits are applied at the um you need your hospital since 1997 today 619 genetic controllers have been performed 111 cases were positive for attacks of Frederick and 102 were normal carriers now the couples were talking about autosomal research disease which means that for a person to get the disease both genes in a pair nine chromosomes must be mutated these children as a ruler come from parents as you can see here mannered woman are a normal Pirates as you can see in their chromosomes normal so they are a carriers of invitation 25 possibility the first child who um 50 percent to have children that are going to be careers to have limitations and 25 that have two normal chromosomes it is a key to see to examine the careers when we have a family of which a member has attacked so Frederick the parents of the cyclics there must be controlled it is very important when we have a scheduled a pregnancy control and plaster must be carried out and this is the only way to prevent the transference of the mutated Gene in the next Generations and it is a way to abolish the disease increase the incidence of over the disease as you heard from the previous species is when there is some kind of affinity between the parents and the common origin so in our unit most of you know it because you have visited us you will have a special Clinic genetics a clinic and the neuro kinetic cell laboratory these are combined and cooperated so in the end we can have a timely and valid diagnosis we provide consultancy genetics consultancy and follow up for our patients in the last four years we have a radical a developments in the first neurology clinic of the United Hospital foreign in the last four years also is a research program that started by Stephanie two years ago aiming at providing genetic diagnosis and clinical diagnosis free of charge for the Greek population and genetic control of rare neurological diseases in this program is not included and because there is but because there is a panhellenic network we believe that in the future it will be included finally apart from all this a few words about the tests that are qualitative certified by a European Network he foreign [Music] many Genies are going to be tested using New Generation sequencing automated instrument for DNA isolations and this field is that the results are going to be more coordinated than what is happening now and accuracy the space that we have in the laboratory is expanded by 25 square meters here for the new instruments foreign I am optimistic about new treatments but in order to eliminate the disease if the screening the genetic screening is included in the prenatal yes of a person that wants that a child in the family this is a procedure which is not a very expensive and we have a radical outcomes thank you very much for the excellent presentation and the informations she gave us which places besides the role as I said we do not have question time for questions I would like to thank all the speakers and I think it was confirmed is great thank you very much it is a very important contribution in today&amp;#39;s event I think the fact that we came to one o&amp;#39;clock shows the interest and then I think we will not have time for uh for our break because we have people from Australia and the United States therefore we should be on time therefore I know that you are tired but let&amp;#39;s give a stretch for five minutes and then we change the panel into a carry on thank you very much it is a campaign of the European Parliament for the protection of children for children&amp;#39;s abuse and she coordinates the National Action Plan for sexual abuse to take the floor please I would like to thank for the invitation we wish you good fruitful conference I am here as a coordinator from the European Council for sectional children&amp;#39;s abuse who sensitizing make people aware with all the tools that we have from the European Parliament so that we can preach the children all the golden rules that the European Consciousness talk to them about their body uh all the related issues and now we have a new cartoon story where the protagonist is on a wheelchair so that we can protect the more vulnerable children our aim is to stand by them listen to them so that they know how they can avoid the situation that may lead them a difficult situation but make parents aware to be careful with the emotions of our children you know a real name sexual abuse comes from the family environment for the child who knows the person or trusts and perhaps we know this person one out of five if children in Europe will have sexual abuse in Greece which is 16 and only two out of 100 children break their silence because their feelings are mixed the person that they love and to carry on we through the informative tools to try to urge children to speak but at the same time the state has a national election plan with the initiative of the Prime Minister which is for the protection of children&amp;#39;s sexual abuse and for this action plan 11 Ministries cooperate so that we can restructure the institutional operations become 10 children friendly and help towards this direction we thought that they informed children are safe we continue the sensitization in the awareness campaign I will leave the informative material so that it can reach our children and I will be here to stand by in your efforts as a member of Parliament and at the same time in any other field that may be necessary thank you very much for your attention it&amp;#39;s time to go to the second panel to talk about the clinical research and Innovative treatment I&amp;#39;m very glad that we have we women have saying beautiful drugs importance and it is proved by all of you that you are here and every day at the place of your work the next chord another hematological Clinic hospital and associate professor at the Washington Seattle University in general treatment and the universe professor and when she events she set up the program in the hospital she spent time into transplant with the patients new therapies and treatments you have the floor thank you very much I am glad that I welcome you into this session which I think we all expect since it mentions to the Innovative treatments for free life but actually it is a great honor to chair this session I would like to thank Mr karachias for this honorary invitation to help the thank him also for the ability that he gives me to get to know the disease I only remember it from my student here and his Devotion to the disease and the effort for treatment the mobilized me as well as a scientist that has to do with a gene treatment and from now on we are planning without the researchers in Thessaloniki to be able to approach from our side the gene therapy for this disease in English [Music] we have a distinguished speaker with us uh dri mirela erotica news Dr Stephanie and Dr Mendes George um [Music] will be uh joined will join us virtually Dr erodic is with us here um and um I would like without any further delay to start I will start um I was um I will switch to Greek now uh I will start basically treatment in order to understand and non-scientific audience to understand what you we are going to hear later on Ataxia um free dry is a rare disease but what we call rare diseases and how rare are they reality rare disease is characterized by the is considered that uh UH 60 people in the United States 15 Europe 75 in China 100 000 people right these are chronic diseases many times difficult which can affect every system in the human body however for the rare diseases interesting thing from from research groups is not a particularly high as you really understand for more rare diseases in reality they represent and non-fulfilled medical media a rare disease perhaps the term is it yeah not disorienting if we consider that more than seven thousand rare diseases are that affect the over 400 million people all over the world and these numbers are increasing since new rare diseases are recognized and characterized the gene therapy theoretically could correct any Gene disease and foreign for Gene treatment is that we are talking about a biological product which comprises from a combined DNA and it is used in the human brains in order to correct to replace to other or to eliminate them a genetic a mutation or not depending on the target where the final Target is to treat or to address diseases gen genetical problems the gene treatment is a new medical practice it is as regards to basic access is that compatible medicine act by changing the phenotype the patient has to have the treatment by receiving the agent and exogenously and also chemotherapy however creature many problems on the other hand the gene treatment is a holistic way of addressing the problem since it targets the root of the disease and Gene that is a mutated it can be transferred to the cell and is ideally come down with a gene correction in C2 or alternatively with generation then the underlying disease can be corrected the other side which shows that the real in reality Gene treatment is a new medical practices the fact that the new UE era in the treatment where we have been in has changed the traditional model of the drugs which is not produced massively standardized but the raw material derives from the patient and the end product ends up to the patient it&amp;#39;s a customized treatment and it is not a drug that is going to be metabolized we are talking about live cells for and they remain there for the rest of the people&amp;#39;s life that&amp;#39;s why we are talking about live drugs therefore it is a new medical practice at this point we have to point out that the change between convince only in somatic cells and not in any products in cells we don&amp;#39;t want to create uh generally generations of mutated people only in the issue that it has a problem in order to create a penalty and not to corrupt to correct a natural how does it work the gene treatment it works is based on viruses that become inactive takes place by removing the structural elements of the virus and in their place we have the natural General this is a natural Gene is mentors a viral Vector enters and monitors the the divisions in the cells but also to have the expression of the virus in the long term otherwise will remain [Music] but that does not guarantees the expression how is he delivered either it was used the treatment is used when it is easily accessible the cells as you can see here is used when the target cells are not easily accessible like the lungs liver foreign important this and here we have another example of Hemophilia other genetic treatment very simple procedure for the patient the viral vector is used immediately in these cases we use a stereotypes of the viruses that show tropism towards them tissue there are two basic ways the traditional the classical kind of alternative treatment addition of regime in the Target cell using some viral vectors Vector is going to be incorporated inserted remains with the mutated Gene but the protein that is generated produced is normally the technology of genetic processing has been advanced in recent years and in this way we can Target the relation side we use a salmon nucleus is specific for the targeted side the these nucleus is that act as a molecular scissors and with the nucleosis and the guide molecule that leads us to the Target Point targets we have the correction of this mutation the differences of these two approaches are that the target side is critical here is not predictable another way you have a genetic treatment there is a combination with the Democratic cells technology and we have the possibility to reprogram them by putting them in a culture with a cocktail of a transcriptional age researcher we get them into a naval developmental stage and in this state we have two choices to have a genetic processing to correct the genetic relation the genetic damage so to have an enriched population of the genetic cells have to be transplanted and the other um well it is at this stage to have a differentiation of these cells the abnormal Gene so we have an Enrique the cell the rich population of the disease that cells and with the old 3D cultures and choose new drugs foreign [Music] the specificity of a cell 40 years have gone by since the beginning of genetic treatment and nowadays we have excellent clinical results and outcomes and many drugs for rare diseases that have been approved by the various institutions and the genetic treatments and nowadays we have many success stories in a variety of diseases hospitality 500 the ones that we have approved products and I confused by saying that as a president of the association of genetic treatment and their regularity of medicine we support the research for real diseases you can see that in the program of having the agenda of our conference on the 27th of May 28th and we are all invited to participate foreign speaker she&amp;#39;s a doctor doctor Mirella she&amp;#39;s an associate professor and principal fellow in Imagine Institute she leads the research group on mitochondrial diseases oh sorry I apologize sorry for that um so um a principal research fellow at the law of Russia medical research institute at the University of wall of rock in Australia and her research focuses um in human stem cells to develop models for studying the nervous system and also to develop therapists for neurodegenerative diseases and in particular Africa so um the stage is yours thank you very much I&amp;#39;ll just share my screen and please be a moment sorry can you see that okay okay so firstly I would like to thank um the it&amp;#39;s um the it&amp;#39;s the possibility to speak today this um meeting I&amp;#39;m sorry I um can&amp;#39;t speak Greek I really wish I could but um yeah thank you very much it&amp;#39;s a great honor to be presenting at this meeting so with this brief talk I&amp;#39;m really going to be speaking mainly about in the overview of the research Direction our lab is taking in terms of for um Frederick say tax yeah and so sorry I will just move on so when we think about different therapies for um fa the ideal scenario obviously is to basically correct the mutation because that is the the critical thing causing it is that GAA expansion and obviously the uh new technologies moving forward with this in um in particular in crispr Technologies the other approach is obviously to deliver for a toxin and there are our group and other groups around the world working on this as well in particular looking at different Delivery Systems and it could be using a viral approach as we&amp;#39;ve just heard before from um in Valley Church you&amp;#39;ve introduced that really well as well as obviously nanoparticles the next level approach is to then potentially promote cellular Health in particular their cells that are degenerating or to prevent further degeneration and progression of the disease and a lot of these approaches in therapies are looking at in particular antioxidants or other compounds that may endogenously increase protection levels and finally there is also the possibility potentially for some tissues for tissue replacement and in that case would be transplantation the reason that I&amp;#39;m highlighting all of these approaches is just to show you that stem cells can feed into each of these because stem cells offers a really useful platform to test these different therapeutic Avenues in a more High throughput system before you go into the human and patients so when again to this audience my apologies how I&amp;#39;m pitching at some they have a great understanding of stem cells and others that may be new but I thought to sort of go back to some of the basics so really when we Define a stem cell obviously it&amp;#39;s a cell that can proliferate to give rise to cell and also a cell that can proliferate to give rise to a specialized cell are relevant to that tissue now there&amp;#39;s many different types of stem cells in the body those that give us the hemopridic system the bone marrow and and so forth but the ones that we work in the lab are these induced pluripotent stem cells and these stem cells are actually artificially created even though they&amp;#39;re derived from Human tissue or in patient cases so this was technology that was developed around 2006 by professor shinya yamanak in Japan and there was also other groups involved in the US and he got a Nobel Prize for this work in 2012 because it really was a game changer for modern medicine mainly for disease modeling so very briefly and again I could although I don&amp;#39;t understand Greek I could see the slides before that you already introduced this concept but the technology behind this is that essentially can take human tissue usually we use skin cells it can use even fat cells or blood cells and introduce four or five different genes or proteins in the past we used to use viruses but now there&amp;#39;s many other approaches that essentially these four or five proteins the combination of them converts we say reprograms these skin cells to become into a pluripotent state so this word pluriponent means that these cells have the capability to give rise to all cell types of the body and essentially they&amp;#39;re mimicking embryonic stem cells that you find in a particular stage of the blastocyst which would give rise to the um to the baby or the the whole human body so once they&amp;#39;re in a pluripotence state then in the dish we can then drive them into different cell types of of the body that we may be interested in and you can appreciate this technology is really powerful because we can do a lot with these cells we can genetically edit them to either correct the mutations we can introduce new mutations to understand the disease obviously use different cell types for drug screening screening and for some diseases in some scenarios you can transplant them back into the patient as they&amp;#39;re moving forward for Parkinson&amp;#39;s Disease so when this technology came about our group and also other groups around the world um quickly moved forward into this technology to develop Fredericks Ataxia ipsl lines so in our lab alone we&amp;#39;ve got about at least 30 different Fredericks attack system cell lines and obviously there&amp;#39;s other stem cell lines around the world and the main lineages that we&amp;#39;re focused in working on and this is also with other collaborations in Australia is the main tissues main cell types affected in fa so that&amp;#39;s the cardiomyocytes relevant to the heart tissue then we&amp;#39;ve got all the different brain cell types in particular the cerebellar um um neurons and then in my lab in particular we&amp;#39;re primarily interested in the dorsary ganglia Sensory neurons so this is where the proprioceptor neurons are found the which are the neurons are sensory neurons that are innervating the muscle that are sensing feeling and it&amp;#39;s these neurons as well as this um cerebellar neurons that are one of the primary sites of degeneration that begins in FA so this is just to show you you know the basic concept where you can essentially go from skin to stem cells to neurons and these neurons that you end up in the dish essentially have the same genetic background of where they came from so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost like the same cell type that&amp;#39;s converted to different stages and um and different different properties so why use stem cells for screening well obviously there&amp;#39;s you know a lot of value but one of the main things to highlight is that one same that one cell lineage you&amp;#39;re working with you can differentiate into the multiple lineages so you can have the cardiomycytes you can have cerebellar neurons you can have the door through ganglia Sensory neurons so you have a really nice platform looking at different cell types but again with the same genetic basis and and other properties obviously because it&amp;#39;s an ongoing resource you can make multiple patient lines with varying genetic backgrounds different GAA repeats and different phenotypes you would say reflecting different disease progression and obviously they&amp;#39;re quite a valuable resource for high throughput you know screens with different Therapies so for this talk I&amp;#39;m just going to give again a very basic overview how we&amp;#39;re using stem cells to look at differential Gene Delivery Systems for delivering protection to the body so again it was it was really presented very well in the previous slides as I could see from from um from what I saw that gene therapy is very much an umbrella word for meaning many different types of approaches it can be X fever where you genetically manipulate the cells and then transplant those cells into the body or can be directly in Viva where you actually use viruses or nanoparticles to deliver the gene into different Target tissues now of this as you can imagine like all Technologies the many different parts that you need to work on at the same time to get it all right and with gene therapy one of the main things to get right is actually the delivery system so how you&amp;#39;re going to deliver for a taxon then there&amp;#39;s other issues as well on how much ritaxin to give and how to actually deliver for a taxon to the right cell type and also into the mitochondria now we&amp;#39;re quite fortunate in our lab that we&amp;#39;ve been funded both from Farah USA and also from the Australian government to look at differ a multi-prong approach different Delivery Systems in particular the nanoparticles or using Associated adenoviruses or viruses so with um no matter which approach you take whether it&amp;#39;s nanoparticles or viruses or different types of viruses the key thing about the delivery system to appreciate is that every cell in the body has its unique signature and will only allow certain things in and others it won&amp;#39;t allow in and so when you&amp;#39;re trying to develop a delivery system you have to think well what will preferentially deliver this gene into this cell type and not others so what is particular about the particular nerve cell and there&amp;#39;s so many different types of nerve cells with all different properties which will allow for taxon to get into this particular nerve but avoid the liver for example so this is where again stem cells offers a really good platform to screen for these sorts of things so with the case of looking at nanoparticles so we collaborate with the group from University of Melbourne Professor Frank Caruso who&amp;#39;s a bioengineer and Dr Christina Cortez Hugo and we&amp;#39;ve been um this is a pharaoh funded project both USA and Australia and where we&amp;#39;ve been using basically um these stem cells or sensory neurons to screen different nanoparticles but the things that I&amp;#39;d really I&amp;#39;m not going to show data but I just want you to appreciate the concepts behind this so nanoparticles are usually engineered um constructs but they can be also naturally occurring and there&amp;#39;s many different types of materials that can be used in the nanoparticles so you ones that we&amp;#39;re particularly looked at are silica based nanoparticles even gold nanoparticles or you may be familiar with the lipid nanoparticles which where the covert vaccine was used to deliver the MRNA there&amp;#39;s also different ways in which you can assemble the nanoparticle itself so it&amp;#39;s not just the particle but different approaches we&amp;#39;ve looked at was saying layer by layer so the core of the particles there was silica but the external part of the composition of the nanoparticles was a different sort of material which may again allow better accessibility to certain cells then you can have different nanoparticle sizes as well as the extracellular features which are charged and then as I mentioned you can also have naturally occurring nanoparticles so every example we looked at glycogen which is a natural metabolite that your body makes and some of these natural metabolites you can also engineer and modify in order to attach say the DNA of Interest the gene or the MRNA so that it can get into enter into the cell and the strong advantage of nanoparticles is that it&amp;#39;s not just about delivering DNA obviously they can be used to deliver mRNA again thinking about the covert vaccine they can also be modified to deliver proteins or particular drugs so the bottom line with nanoparticles is that they give us the greatest flexibility for screening to look at different components to deliver for attacks into different tissues however because it&amp;#39;s a double-edged sword because you&amp;#39;ve got all those different variations the screening takes longer so over the years we&amp;#39;ve been working with as I said these bioengineers and looking at different nanoparticle types different nanoparticle sizes charges particle densities the way they&amp;#39;re assembled and we&amp;#39;ve been using our Sensory neurons derived from fa patients as a platform we&amp;#39;ve been culturaling them in 3D in 2D to screen the the various types and we&amp;#39;ve obtained some quite promising results with different compounds like silica based small nanoparticles and glycogen and then however I would like to flag that also when we then go to the in Vivo model when we test these in say animals we see sometimes quite different results so what we may see in the dish doesn&amp;#39;t always necessarily translate to what we see in Vivo and that makes sense because in the body you&amp;#39;ve got the immune system you&amp;#39;ve got even in the nervous system you&amp;#39;ve got glia that can soak up different things so that&amp;#39;s okay because that&amp;#39;s the approach we take so we do all our screening in this in in our stem cell based cell types then we go to a new Vivo if it doesn&amp;#39;t work we go back to our platform and look at and stream the next candidates so just because it doesn&amp;#39;t always translate it&amp;#39;s not necessarily A Bad Thing it actually validates the purpose of having a an in vitro screening platform to Fast Track This to then choose the top candidates for the in Vivo scenario for the annual studies so the second approach as I mentioned is looking at viruses in particular the adenoviruses this is work that was very recently funded um only last year so again it&amp;#39;s still early days and I&amp;#39;m just going to highlight um the con the approach that we&amp;#39;re taking um so basically there&amp;#39;s three main aims and this is uh quite a large-scale project um involving many collaborators across Australia and a lot of different expertise and I myself don&amp;#39;t have expertise in um in adenoviruses but we&amp;#39;re collaborating with them Dr Le Sheckler whiskey from University of Sydney who&amp;#39;s our you know virus Guru who advise us on everything so again with adenoviruses there are many that have been used in clinical trials at the moment but those of you who are familiar with this technology are aware that as with these aavs there&amp;#39;s many different types and they definitely have different preference into which different tissues they can Target so with our collaborators what we&amp;#39;re doing is we have these different libraries and kits so we&amp;#39;re screening one is an aab testing kit so in this kit there&amp;#39;s at least 70 different aavs which are at the moment available some are being used in clinical trials and that and some are being used in the lab and we&amp;#39;re using those to screen our different stem cell platforms to see which ones preferentially get into the cell in parallel we&amp;#39;re also screening libraries of bio-engineered aav so these have been randomly mutated in different ways particularly at the Casper that is the external part of the virus that determines where it how it transfects into what cells are transfects into and we&amp;#39;re using the same cells as the screening platform now both the kits and these libraries have been barcoded so they&amp;#39;ve been genetically modified so like when you go to the supermarket and you go through the screening and every product has its barcode so the idea is that we transduce infect ourselves with these different libraries and the ones in which and they&amp;#39;re carrying a gfp protein a green fluorescent protein and the ones which show to be efficiently infecting the cells we&amp;#39;re able to isolate by fact sorting sequence it and then um and then identify which particular adenovirus type whether it&amp;#39;s by an engineered one or one that&amp;#39;s available was preferential in efficient in transfecting that cell type this will take two or three rounds but we from there we will get our top candidates as I mentioned the main platforms that we&amp;#39;re using is the cardiomyocyte so this is in collaboration with um Dr Max Lim from Saint Vincent&amp;#39;s Institute in Melbourne and he has beautiful models of using using the same stem cell lines as we have in making cardiac organoids so these are tissue-like structures that are mimicking the cardiac you also can introduce vascular cells and and neural cells into there and has beautiful functional assays to measure activity um the other collaborators with Dr Sam Naylor from Queensland in Australia and he has developed the technology to make cerebellar organoids so as you know in FA the main region of the brain mainly affected is the dentate nuclear nucleus within the cerebellum so Sam has been able to derive these cell types from these stem cells and make them into these little organoid-like structures and what&amp;#39;s nice is that in his um organoids he has identified quite a large proportion of the relevant nuclei that neurons that we&amp;#39;re interested in which is the Deep cerebellar nuclei and then in my lab we&amp;#39;re interested as I mentioned is in the dorsal ganglia Sensory neurons and again I don&amp;#39;t have time to go into all this data but there are different types of the one sensing pain the one sensing skin but touch and feeling and the others are the proprioceptors that innervate the muscle and we over the years have developed a lot of protocols and expertise in deriving these cell types in the dish and also just to highlight that it&amp;#39;s not just about getting these Sensory neurons as a whole we&amp;#39;re also really gearing in and we&amp;#39;ve just recently we&amp;#39;re fortunate to get funding from thara to look at this deeper where we&amp;#39;re able to derive a more pure population particularly of these proprio sensing Sensory neurons again these are the large Sensory neurons that are innervating the muscle that are one of the primary neurons that um that are degenerating so we&amp;#39;re using these cell types in in our screens and this is again preliminary data but just to show you um that again in our Pro initially we&amp;#39;re doing these screens as I mentioned with the green fluorescent protein because we need this to be high throughput to extract it through um through identifying the appropriate cells that have been infected so that we can isolate them and sequence them and we&amp;#39;re getting um interesting results you know some are consistent some are different across the different cell types and different platforms and then once we&amp;#39;ve chosen our top say you know three to five candles there&amp;#39;s still more work to be done so there&amp;#39;s the the second part is to look at the dosing of the virus again to verify the efficiency of transfecting that cell type also a virus may be great in you know infecting the cell but it may not be ideal for manufacturing purpose and that&amp;#39;s where we give it to our collaborators in Sydney and they&amp;#39;ve got a lot of experience in in this area we also in the dish can um see how well or poorly these cells interact with antibodies within the within the immune system because obviously we don&amp;#39;t want an immune reaction so we can help avoid that by screening for that in the dish and one of the main parts of the same as well is to specifically look at the liver because the liver is an organ that mops up a lot of things that you ingest in particular viruses as well as nanoparticles so we collaborate with another group again from University of Melbourne who has Works in liver cancer and there&amp;#39;s a lot of expertise in making liver organoids and from patient cells so once we&amp;#39;ve derived our top candidates we will screen these aavs in these liver organoids to see the ones that do not actually infect the liver so it&amp;#39;s a negative screen and then finally once we get through that part obviously it&amp;#39;s all about protection and so that&amp;#39;s we will choose our top candidates introduce for taxon into the candidate top um aavs and then perform similar studies in our stem cell models and going much deeper obviously looking at mitochondrial outcomes and also functional outcomes and we have a quite a bit of expertise in that area um to look at that and just to wind it all up the things that we really are facing now as we&amp;#39;re entering in this work in particularly gene therapy is and again many of you may already appreciate that it&amp;#39;s not just about delivering for a taxa but a key thing is how much for a taxon because I say it&amp;#39;s the Goldilocks amount you don&amp;#39;t want too little obviously but you also don&amp;#39;t want too much so what is the right amount and how do you regulate that so we&amp;#39;re having ideas we&amp;#39;re collaborating with um Dr Marek naparella who&amp;#39;s worked on the um protective promoter that helps regulate protection levels and see if we can incorporate that in obviously as I&amp;#39;ve highlighted translating these studies in the dish to human is always a challenge but we&amp;#39;ve got um already in place with that collaborators different Prime models to sort of address that and then a big thing is the delivery approach so you have to think do you just you know inject it directly into the regions of the brain or do you or the cardiac issue or is it through you know intramuscular or IV again they&amp;#39;re things that we need to consider and one of the main things that obviously the Pharaoh Community is very much aware is read out so we can measure readouts in the dish it changes in mitochondria but again when it comes to clinical trials it is key to even pick up subtle differences and over time to see what we see in the dish how does that translate into humans and it&amp;#39;s and even like subtle changes in it could be as simple as picking up a cup you know something like that so that&amp;#39;s sort of like the overview of our work like I said it&amp;#39;s smaller about the approach and different things to think about um and where I&amp;#39;m coming from is more about the using um the model approach so hopefully Fast Track these therapies as quickly as possible to the to the clinic and all of this work couldn&amp;#39;t be done without the excellent teamwork across everywhere with everyone and of course funding from um Farah and also the Australian government with the mrff stem cell Mission so thank you for your attention oh sorry my shall stop the screen you can Drury who recognize data should we uh go on with the second okay okay and the questions will be at the end so our next speaker series with us so uh Dr rodical Nies as his associate she&amp;#39;s a research director at issue at imagine uh Institute in France and she will talk to us on the role of the iron in the mitochondrial protein protection and how the cellular iron homeostasis is maintained or is distorted in this conditions thank you first first of all I would like to to thank you and specially to thank God that kiss for this very kind invitation to this first conference so uh I&amp;#39;m working in imaging Institute in in Paris which is in nature hospital my group is working on microgram disorders and we have a very special interest to feeling cataxia and I will present you relatively recent results that will be the the starting point for clinical trial so it&amp;#39;s a I must say that the function of fataxine is very difficult to understand and more specifically the consequences of the fat accent defects are very wide and complicated and I will try to show you a small part of these consequences and I will try also to make it very simple because it&amp;#39;s relatively difficult to explain soon as you know fataxine is a mitochondrial proteins these proteins here is shown here is located in the mitochondrial Matrix and it is mainly mainly involved in the biogenesis of iron sulfur clusters is ions are for clusters will then be associated with different proteins some of these proteins stay in the mitochondria and some ions are Focus stairs exceed from the mitochondria and will be associated with other proteins so it means that a defect of attaxine will result in a defect of several proteins inside the mitochondria and outside the mitochondria you know that patients with phenic Ataxia accumulate iron in the brain and in the heart and we were interested in the reason of this iron accumulation and before to show you what happens in Frederick Ataxia I will explain you very briefly the major what are the major actors involved in Iron homeostasis in the cell first of all Iron enter into the cells mainly by the fatigue by the transaring receptor the iron which is the green spot here are linked to transferrin that transfer the iron and this transferine binds to the transaction receptor that allows the iron to enter into the cell the icon can also enter into the cells via different Transporters that are called non-conferring Bond ion and TBI and then after entering the cells the ion is stored in a in a protein which is called ferritin and this is very important because iron is very toxic but so it has to be protected the cells has to be protected from the ion and at the same times the the a lot of reaction and function in the cells need iron so there is very important to have a very good equilibrium that maintain the appropriate amount of iron into the cells that make the entry that regulate the entry the storage and the exit of the ion and finally the iron exceed from the from the cells using the Ferro protein which is another protein so the regulation that of the iron content is very well known since very long time and briefly it it allows that in low iron conditions there is increased transferring receptor protein here that allows iron uptake and decreased ferritin to limit the iron storage to make it available and a decrease feral protein that Limits The Iron exit on the contrary in high iron conditions the transmission receptor is decreased limiting the iron attack but the ferritin is increased to a lows iron storage and the ferroportin also is increased to allow the iron exit and this will make the amount of iron correctly regulated in the sets so as there is iron accumulation in brain and heart of patients with chronic addiction we decided to measure the iron content in fibroblasts of patients which is a relatively easy cells to obtain and to grow so as you can see here we measure the iron content of fibroblasts from three controls and five patients and we did the experiments in fibroblast with no iron we will always high iron concentration in the gross medium and as you can see here the three Contour cells increase little bit the iron content when grown in high iron content but in the philic Ataxia patients fibroblast there is a very important amount of iron that suggests that these cells are totally unable to limit the iron uptake and we then wanted to understand this mechanism and we first focus on the translation receptor first of all we observe that the Translating receptor accumulates in fibroblasts of clinical texture patients you can see here a picture of the cell in which we have as blue the nucleus and in green the transferring receptor and you can see that there is a very higher signal for transferring receptors in patient cells compared to control sets we then we then find try to understand the the reason of this accumulation of transfer in the receptor and to make a very long story short what we learn is that transferring receptor has several other proteins can undergo modification and one of this modification is the addition of palmite which is a fatty acid and this modification is called Palmetto relation so the transition receptor here is shown after addition of this permitted which is the permutilation not only transferring receptor but also the non-transferring bond iron transporter the ntbi transporter also undergo palmitoidation and this Palmetto relation is very important to modify the traffic of the protein in the cells and this is important for these Transporters because they comes from the cell membrane and they have to go inside the cells and then to go back to the membrane so Palmetto relation is very important for this type of protein so it modified the traffic and of course also their localization what we observed is that in friedrichitaxia fibroblast there is a decreased parametration of transferring receptor and also on the ntbi transporter and because of that we this results in accumulation of transference receptor at the same membrane which induced iron uptake because the transference receptor is stacked at the same membrane and continue to import iron and of course of iron overload so this is one of the reason of the abnormal and increased amount of iron in in cells of freak Ataxia patients there is also other reasons but it&amp;#39;s it will be too long and I would like now to focus on on this part of the result because we have now a molecule that could modify this abnormal this decreased by methylation and this molecule is called artisanate it&amp;#39;s an Amity artemisin in the derivative which is known for very long time as the anti-malarial so it has been used for very long time in a lot of of countries and very interesting for us in the case of cataxia this molecule can cross the blood brain barrier and it has been shown that artisanate induced permutation of transference and we then result in Iron overload this has been shown in cancer cells and we use it in fibroblasts of nation with phenic Ataxia and once we observed is that when we incubate when we grow the cells of control and patients with artisanet here you can see the the black box that correspond to the amount of iron in patient cells grown with antigenet meaning that the artisanate reduce has a very strong effect and reduce the ion content in patient sets it&amp;#39;s still a little bit more than in control cells but it has very importantly decreased So based on this results we have decided to set up a clinical trial that we call the Artemis because of the name of artisanetum and uh we we will very soon start this this clinical trial we have it has been delayed for months and monsters because of administrative problems and this is a phase one two clinical trial meaning that it is a study aiming to determine the tolerance and the efficacy of this molecule by this clinical trial we aim to identify the effective dose of artisanate able to reduce iron and we will measure the ion in blood cells in in the patients and the second point is to identify the maximal tolerated dose of active units so it will consist in those escalation study with one tablet of 25 millimeter milligram per day and that will probably progressively increase until we found an effect a decrease of the ion in bbmc soon I this is very impromising and and I hope that we will have success with this clinical trial but I have also to tell you that as I say this before there is a lot of consequences of attacking deficiency and artists unit will act on the permutualization only this is already very important because it will probably modify the ion uptake from a transparent receptor also from the NTB Transporters but also on other functions some of them being involved in the physiopathology of cataxia however there is a lot of consequences of attacks in defect that are respiratory chain defect the the energy production deficiency of different enzymes inside the mitochondria outside the mitochondria especially the hymns and disease the some DNA some some enzymes and protein involve in DNA replication and repair and I don&amp;#39;t say that artisanate will cure completely different cataxia but it will help to to limit the iron uptake that could be detrimental for for the patients and I hope that we&amp;#39;ll have a relatively soon in the six following months uh good news from this clinical trial and before finishing I would like to thank the people who were involved in this work especially foreign was a very brilliant PhD student and Arnold Monique who will perform the clinical trial and I thank you for your attention thank you very much Dr erotic um the questions will be at the end the next speaker in the program is Dr Sophie Stephanie but she will join us after the end of the first session due to the time difference she will join us virtually from San Diego and our final speaker for recession now is Dr Mendes George associate professor of pathology and cell biology and Columbia University Dr Mendes good morning everyone and I hope you hear me well um thanks very much first of all to Mr karachias for the kind invitation to share with you in the next 12 to 15 minutes something that we have learned from a different disease not produce attacks yet but spinal muscular atrophy and why spinal muscular atrophy I hope that you will see in a moment the common interest common mechanisms between the two diseases so a little bit um some of the natural history for uh spinal muscular entropy or SMA patients there are mainly five types as you will see here I hope that you will see my pointer um from type zero to type four the large majority of the patients are the SMA Type one more than 50 percent of them um here in this axis is the age this is mostly a juvenile type of the disease affecting mostly babies in the most severe types which is the type zero and the type one this is a fatal disease and patience suffering from SMA of this kind and of these types succumbed to the disease within a year or two after birth SMA Type 2 is the more moderate um type of the disease and sma-3 and even SMA Type 4 these are the milder forms of the disease with mutually nearly normal lifespan but with severe motor disabilities so a little bit about the disease one of the common things together with fridge Factoria is that this is all about a single protein dsmn protein SMS standing for survival of motor neuron in humans there are two genes as shown here responsible for the production of The SMN protein the Gene smn1 and smn2 you do need both genes because deletional mutations of both genes uh results in embryonic lethality um so the disease is causing due to the deletion or the mutation of the smn1g the smn2 gene is a similar type of Gene but unfortunately produces much less full length or proper protein compared to the smn1 so the disease is due to the severe reduction of the full length protein produced by the smn2 gene now how do we study the disease so one of the important things in preclinical Trials to First understand the molecular cellular neuronal circuit mechanisms as well as design potential Therapeutics we need to use an animal model and in SMA we have used the mouse model however the mouse doesn&amp;#39;t have two genes as the humans do the Mouse has a single endogenous SM and Gene that produces SMA and of course similar to humans if you deleted The SMN and don&amp;#39;t do the gene you&amp;#39;re having embryonic retirement so how people decided to do to recapitulate and have an animal model of the disease they have knocked down the endogenous cement and they have taken two copies of the human smn2 and humanize this into the mouse genome by having the two copies the results of this again is the deficiency of The SMN protein now this cartoon shows a typical type 1 phenotype of the clinical symptoms prior to the identification of the genetic cause of the disease it used to be called The Flop infant syndrome because the baby didn&amp;#39;t have any reflexes uh similar to this type one is the so-called Delta 7 Mouse model and you can see here an affected Mouse on its side is alive but it has very little posture and very little reflex compared to the normal Litter Mate um this mice survived approximately two weeks after birth whereas type ones are similar they succumb to the disease a year or so after birth what are the Hallmarks of the disease first of all the death of spinal mutton neurons in selective spinal segments muscle atrophy and impairment of spinal reflexes and postural defects again these are similar characteristics to what we&amp;#39;re seeing in Friedrich ataxia as um Mirella has eluded previously um we would have liked to see uh the point um that really is key to the pathophysiology of the disease just summarize many years of work from my lab here at Columbia and as well as from others all over the world this is a transverse section of the spinal cord in blue is a spinal motor neuron sending its action through the periphery making um synapses with skeletal muscle in order to activate it but the muscle in itself knowing where our muscles are in time and in space this information is provided by this green cell which is a sensory neuron known as the propresentative neuron which goes and makes direct synaptic contacts with motor neurons so over many years of research now what we have found and the main findings of the disease is first of all that you having loss of this particularly synapses motor neurons effectively dysfunction selective motor neuron death and denervation all these leading to muscle paralysis and if the muscles are affected are reaching the lungs then you have a respiratory distress and ultimately death of the patient as well as animal models so these things particularly now with the proprioceptive neurons raising the possibility that there might be common mechanisms between SMA and Fredericks Ataxia and particularly I would like to point out the following scenario what we have shown is that here is a spinal multi neuron that&amp;#39;s the Soma which resides within the spinal cord this is the action in the peripheral nerve and here is the muscle how do motor neurons work well the motor neon has been activated by pre-motor neurons showing here these different green synapses which are opposed to a certain type of potassium Channel which is the KV 2.1 or also known as the delayed rectifier when your these synapses are activated they depolarize or activate the motor neuron the motor neuron actually and finally subsequently fire suction potentials which these Action potentials transmitted to the muscle in order to produce a fuse contraction and muscle movement ultimately joint movement in the context of the disease and certainly spinal muscular atrophy what is really happening is that you&amp;#39;re having fewer premotal synapses particularly from proprioceptive neurons which are glutamateergic and therefore they&amp;#39;re having less ability to activate the motor neurons subsequently to the reduction and dysfunction of those synapses you&amp;#39;re having fewer delayed potassium rectifier channels leading to a reduction in the firing ability and frequency of motor neurons and instead of the normal muscle movements you&amp;#39;re having Twitches effectively um resulting in an ability to move so because of the essence and the critical role proprioceptive sensory synapses play on the postsynaptic motor neuron function then this raise the possibility that perhaps what is happening in SMA might be relevant to fridges Ataxia as well so a little bit about the current therapies since the gene was developed back in 1995 from Judith milky&amp;#39;s lab in France uh there has been an enormous effort uh at the basic uh maybe the whole research level as well as the clinical level and back in 2016 the FDA approved the very first therapy this is called spindraza and is based on the antisense polygonucleotide approach this is administered intractically and is supposed to be a drug that sorts out the splicing defect in The SMN uh 2G so this can be applied to all SMA Type patients and of course it does not depend upon the number of copies of the smn2 which is really the moderator of the disease there is no limitation and of course this has to be applied for a lifetime and I will tell you in a moment uh how the second uh FDA approved is the gene therapy as Mirella and Dr yanaki has alluded this is based on a viral approach using the Arden Associated viruses or AVS this administered in traffic intravenously and of course this applies to all SMA types and this is a one of treatments you&amp;#39;re having one shot and that is it the third and most uh recently approved is a small molecular approach we have which has been developed by PTC in collaboration with Ross and the SMA Foundation here in New York this is uh basically a pill you take one pill once a day for the rest of your life it could be applied to all SMA patients older than two months old for a lifetime now um a little bit about the cost and the limitations and the differences of the three Therapies spinraza or here the antisense oligonucleotides cause for the first time 750 000 during the first year and 350 000 dollars per year thereafter for life and this being administered intrinsically which means that the patient has to be admitted into the hospital and inject it into the cerebral spinal fluids what are the limitations well first of all The SMN increase depends up how many smn2 coping numbers each patient exists uh it has to be administered within the CNS meaning that perhaps in the periphery that might not be so um accessible you need to have it every three to four months for the entire um life and of course there is pretty high cost considering again is the gene therapy and currently as most of you know is the most expensive therapy for any disease in the world one shot 2.1 million however there are limitations with that first of all it cannot be applied to all SMA patients which have having a much higher antibody than 15 milligram per ml it&amp;#39;s restricted to the age so it cannot be given to any patients because of issues with the blood brain barrier much more important and this is the major difference between the other two therapies with the viral mediated therapy you have really no control of how much you over expressing as I met the cause of the disease the main issues with a protein so it continues since the the viral will transfect virtually every single neuron that it can be applied to The SMN is going to potentially be over expressing over time and in collaboration with Dr pelicioni another colleague of mine here at Columbia we have recently published and we have cautioned the community that when they&amp;#39;re using an aav particularly with uncontrollable overexpression of that protein it might have severe toxicity as we could have seen it in the mouse model whether we&amp;#39;ll apply in humans remains to be seen and we hope that we are wrong but of course this has to be taken into serious considerations particularly for neurologists when they are considering offering advice to prospective patients and other limitations that the re-injections is not possible because as soon as you inject the aav you will start the patient is going to start building antibodies and of course there is always a problem of liver toxicity and potential side effects the small molecule approach currently being marketed by Rush as abrisdi it&amp;#39;s much cheaper compared to the other approach but still quite expensive depending upon the weight and the frequency in the country so this is uh in the U.S approximately a hundred thousand dollars to three hundred dollars a year once a day appeal um there are also limitations with this approach there is um um currently you&amp;#39;re not allowed at least from the FDA point of view to be administered in neonates um it also May Target other transcripts and that suggests that you might have potential off-target effects and of course the cost which is also needs to be taken into account still is considered to be very high so just to summarize what I&amp;#39;m hoping frigid Axia Community is going to learn from what we have found in spinal muscular atrophy research and Therapeutics is that this was extremely fast considering from the moment that we have developed we have discovered the cause of the disease in spinal muscular atrophy back in 1995 and 2016 just over 20 years this has been a tremendous success in identifying the mechanisms and also bringing therapy into the patients however this could not have been done without the production and intense research efforts based on animal models cellular models not only mice but also other animal models that is was key but the mouse model particularly is terribly important as a pre-clinical model in order to go for an FDA approval and then of course non-human primates will be used for toxicity but without proof of concept and proof of principle that we can rescue the mouse from the disease that would not have been possible and this came together with basic uh and clinical personnel so when The SMN level is reduced to 20 the SMA is also considered to be a multi-organ disorder so it does not really only affects the central nervous system although the central nervous system is the major issue you also have other issues with heart liver lungs and so forth and so on so the level of The SMN protein is key to the extent that other organs are affected however the neural circuits between the motor neurons and the sensory neurons are key to understanding motor disorders and motor control there is also a clear and limited therapeutic window because it has been very well established right now that The SMN is very much needed during embryonic development and early postnatal periods SMN is not so much needed in adults so as soon as and it&amp;#39;s a imperative to diagnose the situation pretty fast in order to intervene as fast as possible and it&amp;#39;s current the current uh thinking uh in therapeutic is that the earlier you intervene the better the outcome above all and I want to finish with a positive hopeful message that although SMA it&amp;#39;s not cured there are three currently three powerful therapists that help first alleviating and helping from uh death of a patient something that it would have been impossible 20 years ago and right now we might not be fixing everything but we&amp;#39;re setting getting closer and closer and on that note I would like to thank you and of course should time be I will be more than happy to discuss any questions foreign [Music] so my question is that we were discussed about the possible treatments and the technologies that are advancing how close are commercialization let&amp;#39;s say to be available to patients for all this kind of stuff okay I think the question is from the faith patient all these Advanced Technologies how close could be to commercialization and I don&amp;#39;t know who would like to uh [Music] online now uh I would uh take this question to the next panel where actually we are discussing about the pipeline update so I would suggest to uh to take it as a note and move it forward to the next panel okay uh another question yes Dr Francis so first of all I would like to thank all the speakers for the wonderful presentations and talks and especially those that came from a broad uh either through Zoom or in person that&amp;#39;s uh we&amp;#39;re greatly honored um I have a question for um uh Dr Agnes I think I really loved your presentation congratulations for the very inspiring work that you&amp;#39;ve been doing have you um do you have any insights maybe on that parliamentarilation defect that you see on the transferring molecules whether that is a consequence for example of a metabolic switch or perhaps a defect in gene regulation maybe some uh parameterulation permitted transferases are not expressed as high I think actually we were able to to understand why there is effective permanent solution It&amp;#39;s relatively simple when you have found the solution but it was very difficult to demonstrate it actually the fat accent defect results in the iron sulfur Crystal containing proteins one of them is lipoic acid centers that make the lipoic acid that is involved in the pyruva dehatogenic activity and when there is no lipoic acids and things and no lipoic acid there is decreased pdh activity decrease acetylchoa synthesis and decreased parmito COA which need the capacity for for some disease so this is there is a direct relationship between fat action defects and permutilation it&amp;#39;s wonderful and is the trend that you&amp;#39;re targeting the defect also affecting that cycle that actually we don&amp;#39;t know how the artist unit acts what we precisely but that what we know is that it increased the parameterization of transferring receptor also on other ion transporter and probably also proteins that we didn&amp;#39;t have look at for the moment thank you could I address the question to Mirella also if you&amp;#39;re in line yes yes thank you she&amp;#39;s online hi Laura I&amp;#39;m not sure if you&amp;#39;re you can hear me this is ghosts uh from uh Thessaloniki Aristotle University thank you also very much for the wonderful presentation and for sharing uh such inspiring and exciting data with us here today uh my question um is concerning the development of these novel vectors that you&amp;#39;re trying to Target I guess different tissues with this so how do you envision this in the future do you think that it&amp;#39;s going to end up as a combination therapy using multiple vectors or are you trying to find a single Vector that targets the uh disease tissues while at the same time protects or does not enter liver for example or other tissues thank you okay thank you um for the question and the compliment some we don&amp;#39;t know we we&amp;#39;re throwing everything at it um it I imagine exactly like with the other speakers I think treatments for most diseases is a multi-prong approach and I think it will require you know various approaches for different tissues that you&amp;#39;re targeting and even if it&amp;#39;s a gene delivery it won&amp;#39;t be just Gene delivery I&amp;#39;m sure that you&amp;#39;ll have to add you know other therapies in combination with that I I would be surprised if it&amp;#39;s the one aav that can you know the magic aav that can um infect all the relevant tissues and not liver um so I guess it&amp;#39;s just this is the you know like um I guess the next session and the clinicians would be better to answer this but it would be depend on what is the most um prominent tissue that needs to be targeted for this individual is it the cardiac you know is it regions of the brain and how we approach that and um and again with aavs I mean it was brought up with um the um George&amp;#39;s talk about SMA um toxicities is one big thing and with gene therapy you just have one shot that&amp;#39;s the the high risk with gene therapy um in particularly when it&amp;#39;s you know in entering into cells and that&amp;#39;s why it has to be much more carefully thought out um in that way so I didn&amp;#39;t directly answer your question but I guess the bottom line is no we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re just seeing what aav targets the cardiac and maybe probably another auv that targets preferentially you know the cerebellar and so forth and we&amp;#39;ll just wait and see thank you okay we thank you I actually have um um if you didn&amp;#39;t show us what the promoter of this aab.com um is um [Music] yes so one for the screen at the moment it&amp;#39;s just a standard we&amp;#39;re just using a green fluorescent gfp for the screen so it&amp;#39;s just um a CMV and we in our work we use a lot of the human elongation Factor promotes so it&amp;#39;s just a generic promoter once we choose the candidate aavs we are going to address the promoter and the approach we would like to take is to look at the frataxan endogenous promoter so we&amp;#39;ve had conversations with our collaborator and colleague in U.S Dr Merrick napparella who&amp;#39;s published work in looking at different regions of the for tax and promoter to see what is the minimal promoter region to give rise to for tax and expression and um and I&amp;#39;ve just put in a great earlier this year to look at that with to the Australian government um to screen the three or four different promoters because a lot of it will be about you know obviously regulating protection levels and you don&amp;#39;t want it too high you may be just a minimal promoter would be sufficient to avoid toxicity due to fretaxin obviously there&amp;#39;s also maybe toxicity due to the aav itself but at least the protection so we&amp;#39;ve had these conversations with um the Sheck you ideally you want to a highly efficient aav and then play with the promoter you know so you want minimal you know transfection minimal dose to to so because it&amp;#39;s so efficient that&amp;#39;s the approach we&amp;#39;re taking thank you thank you thank you enough delivered exclusions the main message I wanted to give is that again it comes down to flexibility because again like we heard in the SMA you know talker maybe you know it&amp;#39;s about delivering for tax and protein or for attacks and mRNA or a compound like that small molecule but that compound you can&amp;#39;t just give the small molecule you know be degraded so it needs to encapsulated inappropriate delivery system to enter into the appropriate tissue and nanoparticles just gives you such um you know the vast materials the engineering you&amp;#39;ve got a lot lot more flexibility to work with so aavs you know work well in certain ways but they are limited even with the DNA you know at the moment you can only deliver DNA and a certain size whereas nanoparticles you&amp;#39;ve got a lot more open but with that obviously it takes a lot more work to screen so once you find and this works you&amp;#39;ve got to find the appropriate delivery system to deliver that so definitely nanoparticles needs to be on the table as a delivery system for fa in parallel with with everything else that&amp;#39;s you know from you know our perspective thank you okay so I think uh that it is a time to to close for a for uh an hour let me let me thank the whole panel that was a really forward looking and thank you uh Dr janaki thank you Dr Mirena from Australia thank you uh and yes thank you all it was really inspiring for our patients to see that the research is ongoing and we are looking forward for the next session that starts in an hour with an update on the pipeline so without further Ado Lance is served so please feel free thank you so much session right now which actually involves what we are more or less expecting the pipeline update on friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia and where we are heading amid the science is great we are very fortunate to have all these scientists on board with us but uh we need also to understand the pipeline and where this uh it stands at the moment foreign foreign we are okay and without further Ado let me introduce Miriam right Dr durai she is the director of global relations and initiatives at the friedrich&amp;#39;s taxiary sales Alliance which is the U.S Patient Advocate organization leading globally the world effort for fighting fa and finding a a a an effective treatment and ultimately a cure a medium the floor is jobs and you will introduce to the Rex of the to the rest of the session thank you so good afternoon everyone [Music] well I will reiterate what all those are have done thanking the association uh facilities but also all the other members of his team who are not on this place of the stage today but who did a very great job and I can tell you how complicated it is nowadays to organize a meeting partially in person it has been really challenging and don&amp;#39;t forget to challenge align all the different time zones of the intervene so thanks to the association foreign introducing the pipeline which gen Farmer Market League will do I would like to start the pipeline on fa clinical research okay shall we wait um okay because my message is mostly meant to you here as fa community and yeah I will wait this is why no yeah no problem yeah thank you so I would like to say thank you to the fa Community thank you for all of you present here Affairs parents caregivers researchers thank you to the fa Community for your support to fa research you are supporting the research whether by helping fundraising and we heard this morning how hefa has supported the genetic Lab at agent hospital to keep the adequate equipment needed for the diagnosis of freedoms Ataxia whether by raising awareness and don&amp;#39;t forget May is the month of Friedrich Ataxia awareness so thank you for raising awareness like this event thank you mainly for participating to research studies and I&amp;#39;m saying clinical studies because I know unfortunately not many clinical trials are happening for fa in this regions and I can tell you there is a global effort to change the situation and we are work looking forward sorry to seeing link trials happening here but thank you for participating to the clinical studies and I would like to insist on how important is the Natural History studies on fa like the effect Center here in Athens this is providing a structure and a very valuable registry to better understand Friedrich Ataxia to build and be ready for better clinical trials thank you also for those who are registered at the fritaxia patient global registry soon it will be available in many languages including Greek and data collecting from their health also to build better clinical trials so again thank you for being an active member to the fa research we have achieved together and that&amp;#39;s your efforts some milestones and some important Milestones to the journey on the development of treatment for fa the timing is now very exciting we have a lot of things getting ready being developed we will have today an outline and overview of the fa pipeline that will be introduced by pharah and then we will hear another perspective an industry partner perspective of a specific therapeutic approach and at the end we will have the clinician perspective on treatments under development but also how all these will be integrated into clinical practice so without having extra delay I would like to introduce my colleague Jen farmer Jen is the Chief Executive Officer of Ferra that&amp;#39;s the free drug research free drug attacks a research Alliance in the U.S Jen has many many long years in FA she&amp;#39;s very close to the fa Community Jen has a major as a genetic consultant so she knows very well the disease and I&amp;#39;ve been into fa Fields since 21 years and Jen was already there so you can really trust what you will be telling me today Jen the floor is yours thank you thank you so much Miriam for the introduction and um would just like to join you in thanking all of the organizers of this conference for putting together you know a really um a really spectacular agenda I&amp;#39;ve been able to listen in for the past few hours to a lot of the research talks that you&amp;#39;ve heard and really appreciate being able being able to join the conference today so thank you all so much um let&amp;#39;s see hopefully you can see my slides there we go so um before I get started on the treatment pipeline I thought it might be helpful to some of you for me to tell you a little bit more about the friedrichs taxi a research Alliance and what we do um because we we really hope that we&amp;#39;ll be able to work more closely with ahafa and and your community both on the research as well as um you know basic research as well as the clinical research that Miriam was talking about the Natural History studies and bringing more clinical trials to Greece in the future and so um the Fredericks atexia research Alliance was founded in 1998 by patient families affected by fa as well as researchers and the focus of the alliance is really to advance the research to find treatments in a cure we believe that the way to do that is by raising funds and bringing people together who can both do the research as well as support the research and so a lot of what our organization does is is very research focused um and we we try and do this in in several different ways and these are the um strategic pillars that you see here um so we assemble conferences like this one to bring people together to share information um to make sure that there&amp;#39;s an opportunity for you know education as well as knowledge sharing we don&amp;#39;t want research to be in a silo and we know that it&amp;#39;s important for researchers to also engage with the patient community and the clinical community and and that&amp;#39;s what these kinds of conferences are so important for doing we also um you know spend a lot of time with all of our partners trying to build collaborations we know that you know one of I think when you saw Dr Detroit earlier today talk about her research um it was really impressive the number of researchers both in Australia and outside of Australia that she&amp;#39;s collaborating with um to you know to do her research and those kinds of collaborations We Believe are really important we also know it&amp;#39;s important that we build collaborations with regulatory agencies like the European medicine Association um and you know collaborations between our organizations and you know that&amp;#39;s one of the important roles that Miriam um is fulfilling it for pharah throughout the throughout Europe and so you know we really believe in Partnership and collaboration the other aspects of what pharah does is we directly fund fa research and we fund FAA research around the world we do that through research grants to identify specific you know to to to answer specific questions to understand fa better whether that&amp;#39;s the cells in the dish or studies in people like Natural History studies we also believe that it&amp;#39;s important to create resources for the community so that we can speed up the research process you know I think one thing that we hear from patient families all the time is that the research goes so slowly and so one thing that&amp;#39;s really important to our organization is identifying ways to make the research go faster and one way to do that is to create resources that are available to the whole research community so that we reduce the time it takes to do that research so a lot of the cell models or cell lines that um that are needed to do research we&amp;#39;ve you know put in place repositories where where cells can be shared um amongst researchers animal models um are in places where you know all researchers can access them we&amp;#39;ve also put in place resources like the patient registry that helps everyone kind of understand where individuals with far in the world and allows us to recruit clinical trials more quickly so these patient Registries are incredibly important because they they identify where you know where people with far globally but then allow us to communicate directly with with the community as well as recruit for clinical trials and as Miriam was saying the Natural History studies are incredibly important we&amp;#39;re not able to do clinical trials if we don&amp;#39;t understand the disease in terms of the clinical symptoms how they progress and have ways to quantify or measure that progression over time you know we need tools called outcome measures and biomarkers that can be used in clinical trials to to measure how the disease changes over time time and your participation in these kinds of studies is critical for us to be able to do those trials and so Farah has invested a lot over the last 20 years in Natural History studies biomarker studies to help facilitate getting getting clinical trials going and improving our ability to do those trials reliably and and efficiently so that&amp;#39;s just a little bit about pharah and what we do I&amp;#39;ll switch gears now and just talk about the treatment pipeline before I I jump right into the treatment pipeline I just want to say a few things about how we think about developing therapies for fa um when we think about developing therapies for fa there are multiple different ways to approach treatment and we believe that this is incredibly important we can Target the uh for toxin Gene we can think about targeting the fratoxin protein the mitochondria where for toxin serves its function and we can also think about symptoms that affect individuals with fa and can we treat the individual symptoms that are occurring so when when we try and think about identifying these treatments I like to think of this as sort of a Cascade but a lot of the research that we&amp;#39;ve been doing for the past 20 years is to identify not only treatment approaches but what we call targets so very specific genetic or molecular targets that um you know we can make drugs from that will ultimately you know reverse some abnormal biology or something you know an or abnormal cell process and ultimately lead to Improvement in symptoms and so the kinds of questions that we ask um will inform identifying these these targets and so if we start up here with the fa Gene and the the mutation that&amp;#39;s occurring in FA which is the the triplet repeat expansion we ask questions like you know how does the expansion occur and how does the the length of that GAA repeat expansion um impact the phenotype or the symptoms and the progression of the disease and so it are there treatment approaches that can Target this GAA expansion itself and will that be meaningful to treating the disease we know that the GAA repeat expansion silences um the transcription of the Gene and you know reduces the amount of fratoxin protein that gets made so a lot of research has gone into trying to understand how the repeat expansion silences the Gene and can there are there genetic or um small molecule targets that we can identify that will reverse this silencing then you know kind of going to the next level down if we think about the fratoxin the function of fratoxin in the cell is that something can be that can be substituted by another protein or another drug for tax and functions in the mitochondria and so a lot of work has also gone into understanding what photaxin does in the mitochondria and the consequences of for toxin being lost and so you know the oxidative stress or mitochondrial dysfunction are those things that can be intervened upon can we borrow therapies you know that are being developed even in other diseases that can reduce oxidative stress or improve mitochondrial function then um trying to understand how all of these consequences you know play out in the cell or in the um organ tissues and so you know how do these abnormal processes lead to cell death why are some types of cells more vulnerable than others and then how these changes play out over time in terms of you know changes that might happen very early in development as well as the progressive changes that take place over time and then um finally you know really trying to understand how this all translates to the symptoms that people have with fa and which of those symptoms are most important for for developing Therapies and so this just should hopefully help you understand how we think about trying to develop treatments for fa and sort of the the basis for this treatment pipeline and you know with all the work that&amp;#39;s been done over the last 20 years the good news is that we&amp;#39;ve learned a lot and there are now lots of different ways in which we&amp;#39;ve identified where we might be able to intervene in the abnormal you know processes that are going on from the mutation all the way down to you know the tissue dysfunction or the the organ tissue impact in the disease so for example when we think about the repeat expansion there&amp;#39;s work now going on to try and cut out the repeat expansion or or edit the mutation we understand um a little bit more about the silencing of the Gene and specific drugs um there&amp;#39;s a class of them now entering clinical trials called synthetic transcription elongation factors or syntax and these syntops um directly interact with the fa Gene and reverse the silencing to allow more for toxin protein to be made they&amp;#39;re also now therapies um entering the clinic that are both trying to replace the abnormal fa Gene as well as the abnormal protein there are many um drugs now that have been identified that can improve mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative stress and you&amp;#39;ll hear a little bit more about those today as well as you know looking at trying to protect the cell from those uh consequences and symptomatic therapies that you also heard about today with things like trying to um regulate iron or even exercise as a therapy to improve symptoms of fa and so when we take all of this and try and put it into one picture um and try and put it into a picture that tells you where where in the process are different treatments for fa we we this is what we call the treatment Pipeline and so across the top um is sort of the stage of development and starting on the left this is when things are very early um so in what we call Discovery phase and so that&amp;#39;s being tested in the lab in cells typically uh in the dish or sometimes in animal models when um when particular treatment approaches kind of move from the discovery phase and we say yes we think this is a potential treatment it moves into what&amp;#39;s called pre-clinical development and pre-clinical development is where you do a lot of testing in terms of dose and safety of the therapy to understand how you can test how you will test the therapy in in humans and people um there are regulatory steps that occur along the way that are necessary where um new drugs get approved um I apologize that I&amp;#39;m using um U.S language in this pipeline slide um but um you know both in the U.S and in the EU new drugs have to be reviewed before regulatory authorities the FDA and the U.S or the EMA in Europe before they can enter human clinical trials and so these are these are important steps that occur in the process of developing drugs and then human clinical studies occur and they occur in different phases we typically start with safety studies and then move on to what we call efficacy studies to understand how the drug is working and improving you know and if the drug is improving a specific symptom in the disease and then um if we see that the drug is both safe and having a positive benefit it again goes through a regulatory review process before it can be ultimately or available to to patients diagnosed with the disease so that you know doctors can write a prescription and give you a medicine and so this you know here we&amp;#39;re just kind of trying to show you where in the process different treatments are so each of these bars um is you know where the arrow ends is meant to tell you where in development the treatment is then going down uh the left hand side are those treatment approaches that we just talked about so going from and now we&amp;#39;re going in reverse order so I apologize for that but you know here starting at the gene therapies through um the mitochondrial based Therapies so the mitochondrial therapies are the ones that are the furthest along in development um and the first bar here is a drug called omevaloxone that is being developed by a company called Riata Pharmaceuticals and this drug has gone through multiple clinical trials and there was a positive result from the most recent trial and so Riata has submitted to the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S for approval of omap as a treatment for fa and so this drug is sort of the furthest along in the process um you&amp;#39;re going to hear from Dr Matt Klein from PTC Therapeutics about is also in current clinical trials and it&amp;#39;s at the stage where it&amp;#39;s being tested for for efficacy to see um you know how the drug improves the neurologic symptoms NFA there are several other drugs that are currently in clinical trials that are targeting reducing oxidative stress or improving mitochondrial function these are all very small studies typically about 10 to 20 people and kind of looking for a signal to see if if the drug is is having the effect that they think it should have and then if if these drugs um have a positive signal in these small early stage studies they would then move forward to much larger you know multinational studies to really understand if the the full the full picture of the treatment effect um but these are um you know several different drugs that that all focus on mitochondrial function and trying to protect the mitochondria when when fratoxin is deficient you heard earlier today about a drug trial that will soon start in France um that is looking at iron regulation there are several drugs that are currently in developed that are looking at Pathways that are abnormally regulated because for toxin is deficient and so one of those that recently completed a clinical trial in Europe is laryglitazone and that drug is being developed by minarax they did a small phase two study and saw some positive signal and so hopefully we will see laryglitazone go into um a bigger multinational study you know either later this year or early next year there are several drugs that are in development right now that are focused on the for taxin protein and one of them is called CTI 1601 and with CTI 1601 the photaxone protein itself is being delivered and there&amp;#39;s a special carrier molecule that is attached to the protein that allows the protein when it&amp;#39;s injected it&amp;#39;s given through what&amp;#39;s called a subcutaneous injection so kind of like insulin is delivered for diabetes the drug is injected into into the skin but it it then disseminates through throughout the body and the carrier molecule allows for toxin to get into the cell and into the mitochondria and this is being developed by larimar Therapeutics they finished a first inhuman Study last year and currently evaluating longer term safety with the drug before they continue to go into the next clinical trial there are several different treatment approaches that are trying to increase the for tax and gene expression so you know reverse that silencing that I talked about earlier and the the synthetic transcription elongation Factor drugs that I mentioned are also called Gene tax and they are being developed by Design Therapeutics and these drugs have just entered the first clinical trial and so people are getting just you know a single dose of this drug to test its safety and to figure out what dose might work to increase for toxin so this um just started about a month ago uh there&amp;#39;s a a clinical trial ongoing in Australia right now to look at um a high dose of a supplement called Resveratrol um that they&amp;#39;ve been um investigating now for several years that can increase for toxin levels in the cell and should have results of this study later in the year and then there&amp;#39;s a lot of activity in the gene therapy space both replacing the gene as well as trying to edit the Gene and cut out those triplet repeats and so um most of this research is still ongoing in the lab so testing in the animal models to understand dose and safety and distribution but you can see just by the number of companies listed here the amount of activity that is ongoing and trying to develop gene therapy as you heard from several of the speakers earlier today gene therapy is challenging because we want to get the gene to many different cell types in the body and right now the viral vectors and the nanoparticles that are currently available don&amp;#39;t allow for the gene to be delivered to every single cell in the body and so a lot of these different programs have had to pick and choose kind of different approaches both um what cells they&amp;#39;re going to Target or organ tissues they&amp;#39;re going to Target as well as how these therapies are going to be delivered one of the programs being Advanced by lectio Therapeutics announced earlier this year that they&amp;#39;ve gotten approval from the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S to begin their first clinical trial and lectio&amp;#39;s gene therapy approach is to replace the fratoxin gene using a viral Vector called avrh10 and they&amp;#39;re specifically focused on trying to deliver the gene to the heart in FA to protect from the cardiac disease or heart failure and they will they anticipate starting this first clinical trial later this year so um that kind of gives you an overview of the different treatment approaches that are currently in clinical trials or soon to come to clinical trials um Farah keeps this treatment pipeline updated on our website and so you can always visit the website for each of these things you can kind of click on any one of the bars and there&amp;#39;s a paragraph of information that tells you some background about the drug and where the drug is in its current stage of development and just to end um you know to tie together a lot of what you&amp;#39;ve heard today um you know we all know that um there is a high unmet need in the fa Community there are no approved therapies today and so um any treatment approach whether it is to treat symptoms or to you know stop change the disease progression um are going to be meaningful we believe that for fa we&amp;#39;re going to need multiple Therapeutics to get to a treatment and a cure and the exciting thing is that you know we currently have a lot of Therapies in development in clinical trials um and there&amp;#39;s a lot to be hopeful about for the future and one of those you know therapies is currently under review so we could have a first approved therapy you know by the end of the year um there&amp;#39;s a lot of interest from the pharmaceutical industry and I think this is really important for you all to to know and to understand that we&amp;#39;re not doing this alone there are a lot of Partners in this a lot of people helping develop to develop therapies for fa and um you know what what&amp;#39;s critical to making this all go is our Global engagement and partnership um and and that partnership across all of our stakeholders and so um I&amp;#39;ll stop there and thank you for the opportunity to participate today and happy to take questions I think later in the session thank you very much and just let&amp;#39;s see well the slides come up uh let me Begin by doing a thank you to visalius uh and the honor of being able to come and present at the first Hellenic Friedrich Ataxia society meeting I&amp;#39;ve been involved in developing therapies for free check Ataxia for over a decade and it has been cleared to me since the first day I started that getting drugs for patients with pre-truck Ataxia is a team effort that requires a close collaboration between scientists patients families foundations patient associations companies regulatory authorities as Jen pointed out in the previous talk there are so many people that have to work together to get this forward and I am grateful to have been a part of this community in our efforts it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m still waiting for slides I will start talking and the slides will come uh so as I am currently with PTC Therapeutics uh we are a company based in uh Something&amp;#39;s Happened foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign extent foreign okay start again thank you again for having me here it is a pleasure to be here uh let me Begin by talking now about PTC we are a global biotechnology company that&amp;#39;s focused on developing therapies for patients with rare diseases we were founded in 1998 it was a very simple mission use Innovative science to develop drugs for patients who need Therapies that was our goal when we started in 1998 and that continues to be our goal today even with our growth and success over the past 20 years while we are headquartered in the United States we have offices in 20 countries around the world and have activities in over 50 countries and have over 1200 employees but as we have continued to grow we have continued to focus on this mission of developing therapies for patients that need it today we have a very broad portfolio targeting a number of different rare diseases we have approved therapies for diseases including duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy which we heard a little bit about earlier today and have programs in a number of different diseases using a number of different approaches today I&amp;#39;ll be talking about our programs in Friedrich Ataxia and I&amp;#39;m very proud to say that we have two different programs one using a something taken by mouth what we call a small molecule and the other a gene therapy approach which we have heard a lot about today I&amp;#39;ll Focus first on our small molecule program which is with a drug called the tiquinone which is currently in development for Friedrich Ataxia as well as other mitochondrial disease disorders the tichuanone acts at a Target in the cell that is called 15 lipoxygenase who are easier to remember 15lo by targeting 15lo our drug victimone seeks to regulate the inflammation and cell stress which is known to be very important in Friedrich Ataxia and a number of other diseases it targets a specific pathway that&amp;#39;s called ferroptosis which is a big word to basically explain inflammation cell injury and cell death which leads to the symptoms of Friedrich ataxia it&amp;#39;s given by mouth either as a liquid or as a pill and as I mentioned it&amp;#39;s right now in clinical trials for Food Drug Ataxia as well as seizures associated with mitochondrial disease to date over 500 patients around the world have been treated children as young as one month of age adults is up to 68 years old have been treated with a drug and we have learned a great deal about how the drug works the pathway that we&amp;#39;re targeting with particular this 15 Lo pathway has recently been shown to be very very important in a number of brain diseases including common diseases like Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease and Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease but also importantly in rare diseases including Friedrich ataxia the way the drug works I&amp;#39;ll go through now first let me explain what goes on in the cell in diseases like Friedrich Ataxia when there&amp;#39;s high levels of stress when there&amp;#39;s high levels of stress that enzyme 15lo gets turned on when that enzyme gets turned on it increases cell inflammation and cell stress and decreases cell survival and leads to cell death what particular known does is it turns 15lo off and by turning 15lo off it can decrease inflammation it can decrease cell stress improve sell uh cell health and cell viability so basically it&amp;#39;s acting at an enzyme that&amp;#39;s turned on by the disease and by trying to turn it turn the volume down or turning it off it can decrease the inflammation and stress in the cell so the rationale or the reason why we&amp;#39;re developing the ticket on for Friedrich Ataxia has a very strong scientific Foundation it also has a clinical Foundation which I&amp;#39;ll talk about shortly but importantly this pathway has been shown to be very very important in a number of different models of Friedrich ataxia in the laboratory and also by looking at blood samples from patients with future cataxia as we heard earlier this morning from Professor roti iron accumulation is very important in future protection there&amp;#39;s a lot of iron that leads to stress and cell injury and cell death and there&amp;#39;s evidence of the pathway regulated by 15lo being elevated in patients of foodiocataxia so what does that mean it means that we we know we&amp;#39;re targeting an enzyme 15lo that you can see in patients is active in the disease there&amp;#39;s also evidence in models in the laboratory whether those be cells in the petri dish or different animal models of disease that again this pathway of inflammation and cell stress that&amp;#39;s regulated by the 15 LL enzyme is active in Friedrich ataxia we also know that in these same models in the lab particularly the cell models in the lab that when we apply the particular in the drug we see that we turn the volume down a 15 ll see inflammation go down see cell stress go down and see cells survive so when you put all of these different pieces of evidence together it tells us that we&amp;#39;re working on an enzyme that is important that could be very important in the disease and it really supports the idea that turning this enzyme&amp;#39;s activity down can be important to cells and potentially important in slowing the progression of Friedrich ataxia we have also had clinical experience with the tiquinone which supports its further development for patients with Friedrich Ataxia patients with Friedrich Ataxia have been treated in some of our earliest clinical studies which were compassionate use studies where there were reports of improvements in patient symptoms and we have also done a previous clinical trial in patients with Friedrich Ataxia which also gave us encouraging results to continue to develop the drug I&amp;#39;ll also mention that this clinical experience also not only teaches us about the potential for a drug to be helpful in the disease but it also teaches us how to do clinical trials in a disease I think as we&amp;#39;ve talked a little bit about today and Jen farmer emphasizing her talk drug development and Friedrich Ataxia is very changing one of the challenges we have is we don&amp;#39;t yet have an approved therapy so it is hard when you don&amp;#39;t have an approved therapy to know the path to go down to get another approved therapy and so we have all many companies and many researchers have spent a lot of time trying to understand how do we design these clinical trials that we need to take to Ema and to FDA to get drugs approved and there&amp;#39;s a lot we can learn by talking but is the only way to really learn is by doing and by conducting clinical studies and then making learnings and then being sure we apply those learnings to Future clinical trials so as we move forward with the ticket on the future of ataxia we are now in our phase three trial that we call move fa and this trial is building on the scientific rationale I talked about the clinical experience we have with the drug and other studies and also allows us to apply a lot of the lessons we have learned that we have learned as well as other companies have learned in doing clinical trials in Friedrich Ataxia with the hopes that we give the child the highest chance of success this trial is currently ongoing it is being conducted around the world with sites in Europe in Australia New Zealand United States and Brazil and it&amp;#39;s basically what&amp;#39;s known as a placebo-controlled trial which means patients come in the trial and they will get either the drug particular known or Placebo for a period of 72 weeks and that sounds like a long time and it is a long time but again this was one of our learnings that having a longer trial is really important in being able to show that a drug Works in a disease like Friedrich Ataxia which takes many many years to progress our job in a clinical trial is in to take a small part of the lifetime of a person and be able to show a drug works and you can imagine if a drug if a disease is moving slowly that the longer you can see and test the drug the better your chance of seeing it it can slow a disease and so that was one of our important learnings that we have in this trial after this Placebo period all patients will receive the tiquinone for at least 24 more weeks so that means that for patients who enroll in the trial they will have the opportunity to receive the drug even if they go through a period of receiving the placebo first in this trial we enrolled with patients who are seven years of age and greater actually the majority of patients in this trial are between the ages of 7 and 18 years old this is something that we believe is important because if you have a drug that is going to try to slow disease progression it would make sense to try to start it as early as possible before the disease has progressed this was something we were able to do given the experience of the taquinone and treating children with mitochondrial disease where we were able to demonstrate that we could give the drug to children in clinical trials the primary endpoint of the study is changes in the disease rating scale the modified friedrichs Ataxia rating scale and we&amp;#39;re also looking at activities of daily living as sort of the secondary a key secondary endpoint or another critical thing we&amp;#39;re going to measure in the disease in the trial to demonstrate that the drug is having an important effect on patients with regifitaxia I mentioned that this study is fully enrolled and we expect to have the results of this trial in the springtime or what we say the second quarter of 2023. I&amp;#39;ll now shift gears to talk about our other program in future cataxia which is our gene therapy program and PTC has a platform of gene therapy programs that includes Friedrich Ataxia and other diseases we&amp;#39;ve taken an approach in our gene therapy programs to do something that we call targeted delivery you can give a gene therapy in many different ways many of the therapies being studied today are given intravenously that is it&amp;#39;s given like an as an injection and the gene therapy then has to travel to many parts of the body where it might work the approach we&amp;#39;re taking at PTC is something we call targeted delivery to the brain and what that means is that we administer the gene therapy directly to a part of the brain where we think it will be most effective We Believe by doing that there&amp;#39;s many advantages first by delivering the gene therapy to the exact location where you think it will have the most important effect you&amp;#39;re certain that it&amp;#39;s getting there it&amp;#39;s not like you&amp;#39;re administering it to another part of the body and are hoping that enough of it reaches where it really needs to go this also allows us to give lower doses of the geotherapy again because we know we&amp;#39;re getting it to directly the spot in this case in the brain where it needs to go our our first program using targeted gene therapy delivery is for a rare disease known as aadc deficiency aadc deficiency is a disease where children are born with a pout and ability to produce normal levels of a chemical in the brain called dopamine dopamine in the brain is very important for motor activity movement things like being able to raise your head sit up for a child to crawl eventually for a child to stand and to walk and children born with aadc deficiency often don&amp;#39;t have the ability to do these tasks and so what we&amp;#39;re doing with our gene therapy is giving a gene using a virus much of what was talked about earlier today and it&amp;#39;s given through a very special brain surgery procedure that is done now for other neurological diseases but in this case we&amp;#39;re using it to deliver the gene therapy to a specific part of the brain where dopamine is really needed and what we&amp;#39;ve been able to demonstrate is that by doing that delivering a gene that is functioning to part of the brain that needs it we see increased levels of dopamine and then Improvement in motor function this program is is Advanced now in the regulatory process in Europe we hope to have a approval for this gene therapy in 2022 and we are taking the learnings from this program and are now moving into our gene therapy program for fuja cataxia the Friedrich Ataxia gene therapy program is not yet in the clinic we&amp;#39;re still doing important testing before we go into the clinic but this program also utilizes the idea of a targeted approach in the case of Friedrich Ataxia we&amp;#39;re delivering the gene therapy to the cerebellum specifically the dedicate nucleus of the cerebellum that&amp;#39;s a part of the brain we know that&amp;#39;s really really important in Friedrich Ataxia now while we understand that Friedrich Ataxia is a whole brain disease those are the parts of the brains that are affected and we also know it&amp;#39;s a whole body disease many organs in the body are affected we are taking an approach though of delivering the gene to one part of the brain we know that is particularly important to a lot of the symptoms understanding of course that as Jen farmer mentioned Friedrich Ataxia will be a disease where hopefully one day we&amp;#39;ll have many therapies and then it&amp;#39;s going to take many therapies to treat the disease because it&amp;#39;s so complicated while we have a drug in particular known that gets all parts of the body including the brain our approach is to say okay let&amp;#39;s take a gene therapy then and focus on one specific area of the brain and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing in our program as I mentioned we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;re still not yet in the clinic but we&amp;#39;ve completed many important proof of concept animal studies showing that we can deliver the gene therapy we can show that when we deliver the gene therapy the new Gene can make for toxin levels it can make thick accident levels that can vary by the amount of the gene that we give and we&amp;#39;re right now in the process of completing the remaining studies that will allow us to get into clinical studies in patients and as Jennifer mentioned as well these are studies that are typically done in in laboratory animals and what they help us understand is the exact dose that we should be giving to patients and it also makes sure that the gene therapy is safe to be used in patient so we look forward to continuing to advance that program and get it into the clinic as soon as possible I&amp;#39;ll mention that we&amp;#39;ve all we&amp;#39;ve been able to complete the manufacturing process for material that could be used in patients that&amp;#39;s also another very important step in use gene therapy and we hope that once we&amp;#39;ve completed our not pre-clinical studies that we can then move ahead with clinical studies and we&amp;#39;re already talking about trying to do those clinical studies in different sites around the world so in summary PT Therapeutics is proudly partnering and working in the future cataxia Community we&amp;#39;re dedicated to delivering therapies to to patients affected by Friedrich Ataxia and we&amp;#39;re excited to be able to have two different programs one targeting the whole body with the tickmanone the other with the Gene&amp;#39;s therapy that&amp;#39;s targeting one particular area of the brain known to be very important to the disease or our move fa trial of particular known as fully enrolled we&amp;#39;re looking forward to being able to share those results from that trial in 2023 and we look forward to continuing to progress our gene therapy program forward with the hope of being in the clinic in the very near future so with that I&amp;#39;ll thank you all again uh for your attention and the honor of being able to be here thank you Mom that was excellent so let&amp;#39;s move ahead what&amp;#39;s the pleasure to introduce the next speaker Professor Madison he is currently professor at the Department of Neurology and neurosurgery at Napier University in Canada prior to that Massimo has started his journey in medicine in Italy and then he moved to the US and then to Montreal Canada and then he moved to Brussels for over 20 years where I had the pleasure to work with him on fa and last year he moved back to Montreal to continue working on fa because he didn&amp;#39;t want to stop before finding the treatment so my symbol is for you God is he said in Greek the speaker of this Symposium and I really wanted to congratulate uh for setting up these Association that is putting you know supporting patient from Greece and making them really part of the global fa community what I&amp;#39;m going to do today is let me share my screen which I hope you can see now um is to uh make a number of considerations about developing the development of treatments for fa and particularly pointing Outsourcing challenges um it&amp;#39;s not going to be as a let&amp;#39;s say pessimistic dark on the contrary and I think my my first slide really uh shows you how I&amp;#39;m not pessimistic but but really I would like to point to the accent of a number of challenges that are still there and that are being progressively uh takeled by researchers throughout the world and we hope that we can get really Beyond these obstacles to Define effective disease modifying treatments for fa I&amp;#39;m saying I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not a pessimistic on the contrary and just to give you an idea to put that things in context and showing at the slide that shows when I started my research and I failed back in the 1980s uh we really didn&amp;#39;t know much about this disease we knew that it was the probably the most common inherited attacks at least in Europe in people of European descent we knew that it was on the summer recessive but we had no idea of the genetic mutation we had no diagnostic test we had clinical diagnostic criteria that then we realized later on that we&amp;#39;re missing a good part part of the patients and of course we had some supportive therapy but essentially we didn&amp;#39;t know anything about the mechanism of the disease we didn&amp;#39;t know anything about the possible therapy periodic targets within their of course so we didn&amp;#39;t have any treatment and not only available but not even inside and then things have changed radically I would say uh since that time and of course the main Advance was the discovery of the genetic mutation underlying FAA which is as you all know the uh the expansion of the GAA tripler repeat inside the gene according for the protein for toxin uh there are some individuals who have other types of mutation affected the fretaxi gene about so far all of them are what we call compound heterozygous with DGA European expansion which therefore is found in each and every fa patient in the world what does this mutation do and I borrowed the slides from my graduate student now becoming a PhD on easy it causes and number of changes in the structure of DNA and in the uh and in the protein that bind this DNA in the cell nucleus that lead to what we call epigenetic silence that is this Gene is not working anymore uh is not making enough of the messenger RNA and it&amp;#39;s not making enough of the protein it encodes for that is protaxin so basically leads to reduce the level of attacks in uh after attacks in transcript and and protein which are the cause of the disease free track Ataxia is a disease of reflexive deficiency this deficiency is not absolute there is there is a residual level of protection that is made and this is very important and we we realize we can see that some cells in the body can do pretty well with that residual level of protection others do not so that is what we call a specific vulnerability to this partial for attraction deficiency that defines the pathological and clinical features of the disease and how much for attacks and deficiency is important for uh for developing the disease and its entities important can be clearly seen by the fact that you have some individuals as it is a young man in the in the video here within his early 20s he&amp;#39;s on a wheelchair and as you can see severely ataxic and has very low levels of protection and we have other individuals I like the lady here that you can see with Miriam who is in her 70s and as you can see is much less effect the difference is basically in the level of protection that this patients have in their system now this leads us to the first uh you know obvious in in a way approach to try and treat the fa if the disease is a disease of retaxia deficiency let&amp;#39;s see whether we can correct the spectacular deficiency if we can bring the levels of ratio to the to those of um normal individuals or at least to those of heterozygous carriers this is a recessive disease the parents are heterozygous for the positive mutation and they have maybe 50 60 percent of the level of protection of their affected children and they are fine so let&amp;#39;s see whether we can find ways of boosting the expression of fretaxing to that level and this slide shows you some some possible approaches of course the gene editing you heard about it the ACT directly on the geography expansion and get rid of it it&amp;#39;s still at an early stage of pre-clinical development there are a number of of challenges in order to take this to clinical fruition but there are a number of uh of groups that are working on it the second possibility is to the use of epigenetic modulators that is of uh different types of molecules that can act on that what epigenetic silencing that I mentioned before that is that those changes in DNA structure in the in the proteins that bind the DNA a different toxic Gene that to make it silent and by trying to change this kind of structure so to add at this level one can try and boost the expression of different packs in gene that is make it express make it uh put it in the situation of of making iron marinade and therefore protein as if the expansion was not there this function is still there that is made let&amp;#39;s say harmless by this kind of epigenetic modulus there have been approaches in the past that we use molecules all the Eastern acetylase inhibitors Unfortunately they haven&amp;#39;t got two real uh to the clinical phase because of issues about the biodistribution and toxicity and but there is now uh phase one study uh that just started by the company design Therapeutics that it uses an epigenetic modulator essentially a specific molecule that would boost the transcription of the fratoxin Gene and therefore the expression of reduction just started we will see what&amp;#39;s going to happen and then of course that there are a number of other ways of acting of protection deficiency Gene replacement therapy which is the classical Gene Theory be introducing by some kind of a vector a copy of the DNA of a DNA fragment that encodes for frataxin which is an extra copy compared to those in the in the chromosomes and they use it to make the fatax in it that is missing in this cells of probability patients there are other other molecules that can induce protaxin transcription regardless of the presence of the expansion uh there is the protein replacement therapy what you heard from from James Farmer earlier about the um the current Studies by the company larimar that uses for attacks infused to another shorter peptide that allows it to be distributed in cells throughout the body and to get into mitochondria this is ongoing other end users of reaction synthesis there is molecules that are boosted the ability of the fratoxin messenger RNA to be translated into proteins any final Inhibitors of redactive degradation that are also being studied by some groups um all of this clearly as the goal of restoring normal for attacks in the level but let&amp;#39;s ask a couple of questions where do we need to restore for a texting level and when do you need to restore protection levels to have a maximum efficacy and we needed to have a critical look at the what we call the neuropathology of radioactive I will only speak about the nervous system today I am a neurologist but of course there are other other parts of the body that are affected the life of the heart like the better cells in the pancreas that had needed to be considered but just the focus into the nervous system we realize that if we want to restore normal products in levels we needed to do it in the cells that are primarily affected by by fa first and foremost and we have to do it in a time frame that allows these cells to survive because we feel we cannot treat a dead cell of course so let&amp;#39;s see briefly what are the main Targets in the in the nervous system for uh for for taxing replacement therapy so the first Target is what we call the the proprioceptive neurons in the dorsal program these are neurons that are found another inside the central nervous system but it kind of uh small uh kind of swellings of of the nerve Roots uh near the spinal cord uh this contains cells that are neuron there are nerve cells that send their uh their axons the the fibers you know the thin nerve fibers that come from in our cells two uh structures essentially in in muscle and in other uh and intendance that to feel the position and movements about and then the other part of their ads and not their nerve fiber goes into the central nervous system and transmits this information to the brain and to the cerebellum that is necessary for a good movement coordination and balance so basically these cells are key to provide the information about body part emotion and position that is essential for coordination and these are the first cells that suffer and eventually disappear in in in Freedom cataxia and actually the the atrophy of their Central Branch what we call which goes in the posterior column of the spinal cord that you can see here on the right is what gave the name of the original essay by Professor Friedrich which he was called the generated atrophia de espinal strength which means only the generative atrophy of the posterior Columns of the spinal cord and this really shows and this is found very early and one issue with this pathology which is based basic pathology of the fa is the fact that it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to progress very much when we see the patients is already there and we have a neurophysiological data that we collected with a kind of sophisticated technique which is called the magnetoencephalography showing that there is a defect basically the transmission of the brain of this information on body motion and position and this defect actually depends on how severe the attacks in deficiency is to begin with so basically to the length of the ga or indeed expansion that doesn&amp;#39;t really change with time and meaning that when a patient becomes asymptomatic it&amp;#39;s probably already established and we actually have developed uh you know uh now Dr dionizzi uh has developed in in our lab in vitro model in which she differentiated cells this kind of cells to this proprioceptive neurons from uh induced pluripotent stem cells that you have already heard about today and she noticed that these cells of course are flotoxin deficiency deficient the green and orange and red lines showed the expression of radaxin throughout the differentiation and development of these cells and you can see that these are lower than the level so the other two are lines that are the controls but she also noticed that that these cells actually Express less of the markers of the representative neurons like a barbarian one that I have evidence now and the runx 3 which is a transcription factor that is important for the development of predeceptive neurons this just means that there is something wrong in this cells already at the time when the nervous system develops so well before symptoms happen and she also noticed that there&amp;#39;s something wrong in the way that this this nerve fibers grow out of the cells that they are more tortuous they don&amp;#39;t get as far and this is that some quantitative analysis of this and even the electric properties of this cell so these are neurons these are excitable cells that produce what we call like action potential electric signals well their ability to generate this electric signal system was impaired in at least a subset of the cells showing that there is a clear developmental component we have to keep that in mind because targeting this type of cells when when individuals are symptomatics they may already be too late and so we cannot expect a correct important correction of the phenotype by a treatment that are only Targets this kind of cells do we need to Target them I think so because anyway there are certainly some evidence that the developmental stories now to the whole story and these are you know these are uh you know pathology samples from Dr uh in Albany New York who has studied what happens over time to uh to this proprioceptive neurons and they keep being lost so they develop abnormally but they are also lost so they are a Target but this target has to be seen in the context of something that made a bit contribute to the disease to the disease progression but most defect has already been clearly established even before symptoms appear so this is clearly not not a sufficient Target what we needed to Target that we need to Target the cerebellum the cerebellum and particularly the Deep structure in the cerebellum called the detected nucleus that you can see in the upper image on the left the kind of ribbon of gray matter uh it&amp;#39;s a the main output pathway out of the cerebellum the cerebellum is a part of the brain and it does certain types of computation that are necessary for coordination and balance and then it has to communicate the results of its computation if you wish it to the rest of the brain and it does it through the dentate nucleus now this output pathway is essentially lost if you look at the image below the one mark the FH you wouldn&amp;#39;t even see the ribbon of uh uh you know of gray matter in the depth of the cerebellum it&amp;#39;s gone the cells are gone now this is again an early process but it&amp;#39;s not a a complete process when patients become symptomatic in fact we think that the patients become symptomatic when this process starts when the uh dentate nucleus has already dysfunctioning dysfunctional cells and probably has lost already a number of cells and uh the cerebellum cannot communicate with the rest of the of the brain and symptoms of ataxia become very evident at that time that&amp;#39;s when when people become symptomatic now that&amp;#39;s a valuable Target because if we intervene early enough we can probably stop this the malfunctioning and the generation of these cells and save whatever is left and make it functional again so this is a valuable Target this is the target of the gene therapy that has been developed by the company if you see the speaker just before me but you have to keep in mind that there is no time to lose uh this is just a small summary of a study done by a magnetic pressure and imaging that shows how with time this structure keeps being atrophied because being becomes becomes lost so if you enter intervene too late there is basically not much to do again here I think that you understand already from the previous example of distortion of candy in this example that intervening early is a major issue if we want to preserve maximum functional capacity in patients with a failure probably with any kind of neurodegenerative disease so this structure is being lost over time and the data that we have from neuropathology showed that even a few years after seem to announce that is already significantly a traffic and then there are other structures that become a traffic with time particularly what we call the central motor pathway of the pyramidal tracts these are basically the nerve fibers that go from the from the cortex of the brain where the motor cortex is where we decide so the the part of the of the brain and that gives the uh the Stars to the voluntary movement when we want to make a movement it&amp;#39;s our cortex that are activates against the order to the neurons in the spinal cord the control of the muscle and it does it through a pathway which is called the pyramidal tract and this pathway also degenerates particularly the longest fibers so that go to the neurons that control the legs this goes to this weakness this causes muscle spasms so this cause a number of symptoms so that are mostly present in advanced fa and in fact we have neurophysiological evidence that the conduction through this pyramidal tract is in paired what we call the central motor conduction time for instance here from the brain to the muscles in the in the hand it gets you know 15 17 milliseconds from a normal other age of nine a little more than nine milliseconds so you can do this conduction slowed the potential is is lower muscles because weak this this happens later on so we have the third phase in the third wave if you wish you know the drgs and then the cerebellum and then we have this wave of the generation of the pyramidal tracks if we Act only on the previous waves and even if we are fully successful and we don&amp;#39;t deal with this third wave we will nevertheless expect to have some pathology and but they maybe have Friedrich attacks and it becomes more what we look to what we call a hereditary paraplegia a condition in which legs we can we can stiff but without match Ataxia is still is still a functionality clearly causing causing functional impairment but it means they be less dead than NFA so it may be just a partial treatment to treat for instance the cerebellum badly but this part of the pathology progress and this clearly happens with time and because we know that the longer the disease the longer the center of conduction time so the more impaired this conduction in this pathway so basically if we can make a step back we can say that what we want to do with the taxi restoring therapy ideally is to restore physiological level in all cells whose function and survival are compromised by products and deficients but we have challenges as first of all is the limited or unbalance of the value distribution of gene therapy vectors or other therapeutic agents they have to reach these targets at least in the nervous system the target I just mentioned and then they have to direct the protection expression to a correct level not to not too little because otherwise you know the the treatment fails to do what it&amp;#39;s supposed to do but also not to match we don&amp;#39;t want to to have to end any it is this expression has to be balanced we don&amp;#39;t want it to do much in some cells and too little in other cells and we needed to be sustained over time without too many changes up or down because it can become excessive or insufficient over time at least in some cell types so we needed to first of all to know what the current approach has been developed in approaches can do in terms of reaching their targets in terms of how much protection they use and how long and how this behaves over time uh we know that current gene therapy vectors and other therapeutic agents ahead limitation in reaching or relevant to reputed targets within and out of the CNS and therefore we can uh and and that&amp;#39;s why we think that waiting for the Magic Bullet that can do all of this it may be worth starting to use to Target only a subset of vulnerable cells can we cure a faith piecemeal maybe but of course we have to understand that the treatments that are now being used to uh to upregulate for attacks in are probably not be able to are not able to tattoo Target the whole thing there is a trial that will soon start of gene therapy directed for that to what extent in What patients we need to know what can we expect by treating just at the drgs or the the dainty nucleus as I said if you try to treat just the drgs probably we&amp;#39;re not going to get much of of of a benefit because these are already compromised at the developmental stage treating only the dentist nucleus if you do it fast enough we can probably stop the progression of attacks here maybe gets done some improvement in the a taxi component of the disease that they may not probably prevent the later development or weakness and muscle stiffness what we call the uh so turn the disease maybe in some sort of a  parapharasis what can be how much we can expect if on neuroplasticity from bacterial diffusion we target the region the vector May refuse to other brain region and have a more widespread effect that we needed early we need a free clinical studies in animal models to figure that out and of course there is the issue of that administering the second the third treatment to Target additional cells and tissues and referring particularly to gene therapy and the limitation it has from the Yoon point of view is excessive threat action expression a problem how does it change over time I raised this question we know that from animal and cell cultural data there may be a two three-fold higher expression in the normal is not problematic but there are data that the tenfold or more High expression is toxic at least for some cell types this may be related to various mechanisms to match protection I can actually clog the important mechanism into mitochondria the processing mechanism that makes the fatimature photaxine and this may affect the other this may affect the other um other proteins as well that needed to be proud to enter mitochondria and be processed those uh there may be protein aggregation and accumulation we see that it respected cultural cells that over Express for attacks inhabit in the wrong part of the cells and maybe to match and inform Aggregates and of course the iron sulfur synthesis may be impaired if there is too much or one component compared to the others and finally there are some there are some evidence there is some evidence that if you increase too much protection expression you get you get the feedback inhibition of the Dodge strata that may be also involved at the rhinocer for synthesis factor and this may be a mechanism actually of impaired functionality when you have too much protection we have to consider the immune response that can of course first of all and even before you can treat the leads to the exclusion of patients with pre-existing antibodies to the virus from which a viral Vector is derived uh there may be ways around this ways to immune or suppress these patients or better to to derive vectors that do not cross-react with naturally occurring viruses so that a non-viral based but this is all working progress so for the same reason with the current actors today essentially one shot only treatment you cannot repeat and if you have treated one part of the body and then you need to treat the second part of the body that may be problematic there may be lots of efficacy over time if there is any new response is mounted against the cells that have that have been infected by the virus and there may be acute toxicity issues systemic we know that high doses of certain viral vectors like a b can cause a systemic reaction with a systemic inflammatory reaction and dysfunction of important organs like reliever and you can have focal uh also uh you know toxicity related to immune response and this may actually Target the dorsal root gang at the same cells that we try to save in in FA and there is a whole again current research to about this we know already from experience in gene therapy that the preventive and therapeutic immunomodulatory treatments are needed and some some groups are developing approaches to uh that should in principle allow repeat dosing and therefore facilitate also the peace means that this meal approach to treatment I mentioned before it&amp;#39;s about other approaches so you have heard about the queen and you have heard about the continent of the earth about many other approaches uh that are being now in the pipe that are now in the pipeline from gen farmer basically this are targeting the downstream consequence of protection deficiency this is related what fratoxin does if you&amp;#39;re taxing is involved in Iron sulfur cluster biogenesis and if this is impaired you have alteration of its energy metabolism mitochondrial respiratory chain and also energy metabolism is not the mitochondria you have uh you have oxidative stress decreased energy production Etc and of course these may all be targets of attacks and deficiency and I will just and I will just say that there are a number of treatments of course and you have heard about that they are targeting this Downstream consequence of fretaxing deficiency these are important approaches first of all because they&amp;#39;re probably going to be going to be available before some of the for attacks in restoring treatments are really developed in F and secondly because they may be complementary being used together with those to assure that the best possible restoration of function is achieved in in the in the shortest possible time range I just want to mention one final thing uh concerning these approaches to correct fretaxing deficiency you have already heard that that inflammation may be very error and we actually did look at changes in the proteins that are present in the several cerebral spinal fluid that the fluid that bats the brain and the spinal cord and we looked at what if there are proteins that are present at different abundance in FeFe patients versus controls and we found the number but very interesting here we found both upregulated and down regulated the proteins that are to do with the immune system and with inflammation uh showing that inflammation is clearly a component of the neurodegenerative process or the FAE and therefore that we needed to include you know molecules or approaches without inflammatory properties if we really want to have a full spectrum of weapons against the consequences of reduction deficiency how do we assess therapeutic efficacy that will require a long talk by by itself we needed to have clinical outcome measures and we needed to weather what we call biomarkers this is this is a long process that is basically based on the ongoing Natural History studies and complementary studies and no time to get into this but I&amp;#39;m saying this is absolutely essential to proper design of clinical trials and to get to fruition of this therapeutic developments in terms of in clinical trials appropriate outcome measure and particularly understand what is the clinically significant Improvement if we give a treatment we want to see a change in the life of patients we now don&amp;#39;t want to see the change in a biological parameter or in a rating scale that then is in the eye of your server more than in the Life For The observed so that&amp;#39;s uh with this kind of with this kind of uh of consideration I will stop here I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;m even spoken a little too long and I&amp;#39;m ready to take questions together with the other speakers thank you thank you Massimo thank you panelists I hope the participants thanks to all the panelists have a better understanding how the work is being done towards the complicated multiple therapeutic approaches for future dyslexia I would like to ask if we have questions from the zoom chat do we have online questions before taking questions from from the room or we don&amp;#39;t have questions okay foreign [Music] [Music] biology of of the of the disease why does it specifically affect this type of neurons and it doesn&amp;#39;t affect that some other type of neuron or another cell type equally since it&amp;#39;s a gene that is ubiquitously expressed so the protein is so why does it selectively degenerate these particular tissues do we have a good understanding so far thank you uh should I answer okay the short answer is no we don&amp;#39;t have a good understanding uh we are trying to work on it because exactly this is this is a crucial part of the story why certain cells let&amp;#39;s say with 20 percent of attacks in which is probably what you know what&amp;#39;s in an average level in in FA patients why a lot of cells are fine with that and others are not it even sells of the same category neurons cells of the brain some cells of the brain are fine with low fat accent and some cells of the brain on the nervous system are not we&amp;#39;re trying to figure it out and that&amp;#39;s why we are working on on cell with cellular and animal models and we try to dissect really the what&amp;#39;s wrong and we what we also need is to compare different cell types and look what&amp;#39;s uh what are the differences why for instance cortical neurons neurons of the brain cortex are essentially much more resistance uh with possible exceptions of those that are that control uh movement you know from the motor cortex they have long accidents the long accidents is not the whole story because because uh uh other cells there is still a difference even between cells that are also that have long accents uh why we they may be related to specific factors that are important for the development and survival of certain cell types and there are somehow affected either directly by an impairment in Iron Source or cluster synthesis or indirectly by mitochondrial dysfunction or some other Downstream mechanism now we to be honest we don&amp;#39;t know we needed to do this work I think can I ask one question to Matthew also so monthly thanks also for the wonderful token for sharing your your um tremendous work that you&amp;#39;ve been doing with the company my question is regarding that small molecule drug that you&amp;#39;re developing and it&amp;#39;s targeting unsaturated fatty acid oxidation if I understood well do you have any input on whether the effect of the drug might be different on neuronal Cells versus heart cells for example heart muscle primarily relies on fatty acids for energy and the opposite acting if I&amp;#39;m not wrong might happen under stress so I&amp;#39;m a neuron an enrolled component so can you target I mean the drug specifically or is it going everywhere and it might have uh different types of effects thank you yeah very good question that the target of the drug is an enzyme and a pathway that&amp;#39;s present in all cells and has been shown to be a response Pathway to oxaver stress in all cells which is you know rather than a specific approach we&amp;#39;re taking a more General approach to a pathway that could be important in every part of the body that&amp;#39;s affected by effect um but yeah um so I would like to ask you what kind of vector do you use for the clinical trial is an aav and what&amp;#39;s serotite it&amp;#39;s an AV we haven&amp;#39;t yet shared what the serotype is we&amp;#39;ll do that once we&amp;#39;re getting closer to go into the clinic oh okay and one more question actually to both of you um given the complexity of the regulation of to regulation and the multiple tissues affected um how you foresee that or how close would be I mean the therapy to work yeah I I think that&amp;#39;s a very good question um I I think we are all um I always like to tell the story when I was in medical school many years ago uh when the human genome was cloned and everyone believed now that we understand genes and diseases we can fix every disease um but obviously it&amp;#39;s taken us a long time and I think there is understandably a lot of excitement for gene therapy and the potential for gene therapy for diseases including free drug cataxia which results from a single Gene so the idea is if you can replace the genes that aren&amp;#39;t working perfectly with the gene that&amp;#39;s working well can we fix the disease and I think that promise remains however I think as we&amp;#39;ve talked about in the research has shown as well uh getting from this idea or something that sounds biologically very simple and turning that into a therapy is a long road I think we have a lot of complete Minds working on this together which I think will help uh I think it&amp;#39;s uh I think there&amp;#39;s promise I think we are there&amp;#39;s now one gene therapy in the clinic uh that Jen farmer shared for for the heart I think that&amp;#39;s a great sign uh I think we will learn and continue to get better and better at this and I I think it might be that the first Gene therapies don&amp;#39;t aren&amp;#39;t sure but can actually help the disease and I think that as we move forward we can think about and gene therapy advances right so that you can do repeat dosing or give one vector to the brain one vector to the heart one those types of things that I think we would all like to be able to achieve with gene therapy I&amp;#39;m not sure we&amp;#39;re there yet but you can definitely see that as we say the stones on the path to get there thank you foreign [Music] what needs to be done so we can see more Greek patients enrolled to church cases and I mean not a generic question who needs to do so okay find something government who needs to do and what if you can answer that question thank you thank you for this question um do you have anything to add about that because you have experience in global physical trials we have another question in the same line asking what the community could do to accelerate approvals but also accelerate access to trials globally since your company was in touch with differentiability agencies and have foreign clinical trials globally can you give us an answer so I will say that when you do clinical trials there&amp;#39;s many balances to try to include as many patients as possible but also um to make sure that you can efficiently get all the patients into the trial that you need I will say that this meeting today is from my point of view a tremendous success uh in in uh bringing the community in the future for taxi community in Greece together with the global Community uh I think it raises awareness and showing that there is structure and the ability to participate in trials and I think you have a wonderful leader who I think is a great Advocate lastly in advocating for reading trials to Greece I will also say that the friedrich&amp;#39;s taxi research Alliance I won&amp;#39;t speak for Jen she can speak but I think it&amp;#39;s been a tremendous job in building a Global Network of trial sites to health companies like us when we try to do clinical trials to already have uh leaders pointed out structure pointed out to allow for doing clinical trials which are a lot more complicated than just doing clinical medicine there&amp;#39;s a lot that goes into it that&amp;#39;s needed in the future protects or research Alliance has done a tremendous a terrific job in setting up sites around the world if I may add a comment I think it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s really important is the existence of networks of clinical sites that work together for the Natural History work together to develop and test biomarkers and work together in order to Define how to best design a clinical trial there is a network like this in Europe and Greece is part of this network is called effects of the European Freedom Consortium forever translational studies if initially funded by the European commission but now leading our independent life and there is another Consortium in the in North America but also extending to Australia there is essentially supported by far right these two are planning to be integrated and work together in the future and this is essential because this will really offer the infrastructure to do trials that will not leave exclude anybody anywhere in the world from a clinical trial because you have and the companies that are doing clinical trials are going to be uh the uh let&amp;#39;s say the partner of the structure they are going to be invited to to to have a connection of the with these networks in terms in terms not only of of you know implementing the trials but also designing the trials in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t uh that doesn&amp;#39;t to exclude anybody and in a way that is most effective to to get to the the you know to to have the results that we want to know if something works to do if something is safe and effective so Greece is part of the map Greece is that is involved with the effects Consortium and the effect of Consortium and the other country which is called the CCRN are going to be more integrated in the near future and offer really the possibility to everyone to be part of this foreign I would add a more complexity to the questions that got from the audience as well about pediatric clinical clinical trials on fa if any one of you could add a couple of words on it on the feasibility and complexity of it so that will help the audience to understand why not much is happening in the Pediatric population thank you well it&amp;#39;s not that not much is happening with a pediatric population is the fact that the Pediatric population is specific regulatory needs I mean the regulatory agencies that have to authorize the trial and they eventually have to accept and the the Therapeutics that come out from this this trial uh they enlightened them they have uh they have specific requirement for children this is perfectly Justified uh children are not small analysis is usually sad they may be particularly vulnerable to certain treatments they needed to be assessed in different ways some of the outcome measures that we use in adults are not really that effective so we needed to design the trial specifically for children and we needed to make sure that something that looks safe in principle and adults is also safe for developing individuals like it so there are a number of issues on the other hand if we think that we have a treatment that may be beneficial for children and children that can really benefit from it and I insisted on the fact that the earlier we treat the better it is we can have a sort of an accelerated way of having the authorization of running trials in children but again since the patient population in a fa includes individual with so many different ages it is probably what you know the the path of least the resistance to start testing and treatment in adults getting faster uh approval to do that and then extend it to children and with additional pre-clinical studies and uh that that are required by by agency but children are not at all forgotten and in the end they will be the primary target of any type of treatment uh that that is supposed to stop or even to prevent to the appearance of certain symptoms yeah and I I guess I&amp;#39;d just add and say that there actually are clinical trials right now ongoing in kids the move fa studies in children uh some of the other clinical trials that are ongoing include include children so um you know we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll continue to kind of see a mix of clinical trials some of them starting in adults and then moving to kids um but it it depends on the treatment that&amp;#39;s being tested and what potential therapeutic impact we think it&amp;#39;ll have in terms of you know what the risk benefits might be to sort of figure out where you know what what the best population is to test to test the drug to start um so there are going to be different approaches for different drugs and I think that&amp;#39;s the other thing that&amp;#39;s important to keep in mind yes I mean the PTC trial is about age seven and the minority started at age 12 so we were including children at least Adolescence in a number of trials that have already been thank you ghost this is very helpful mostly for the parents present today I think we have one last question from the audience and then we should move to the last speaker of the previous session who would like to join them foreign no one needs to be excluded for from the trials and once they are also here in Greece we can also all patients can May participate and my question is are there any prerequisites or any restrictions let&amp;#39;s say how um or more specifically how can patients and carers help from their side is that are there any steps to do to be done and to prepare the way to start let&amp;#39;s say clinical trial what should we do as carers and the stations maybe I you know I can I can I can give an answer and then I I think I have to apologize because they my phone has been ringing many times from random Hospital service today so I need to go but uh let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s put it this way you uh the best thing that you can do to help with clinical trials is first of all to uh be in a in a patient uh registry or database to to make manifest to do the research uh community that you are there and you are willing that you may be willing to participate there are a number of ways there are the patient Registries this is the federal Registries there are the fact of being included in the Natural History studies that the effects or or the CCRN study which is called faicans the resist there are specific studies for children as well so there is a a freedo Academia app that is being developed and that you can just uh that you can just download on your phone and put your you know your information in it and that may help you to uh to be in touch with what&amp;#39;s going on in the research world and even volunteer for for clinical studies so I think the main thing is to be in touch with the community to and to be uh in some kind of registry and don&amp;#39;t forget the app I think it&amp;#39;s a good opportunity now here to make some advertisement of the fa app it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going to be a very important to and it&amp;#39;s available for apple and is available for uh Google uh you know uh Android based assistance thank you yeah and there the app is also um translated into multiple languages and you know just to add to um what Massimo suggested I would I would also say the the other thing about you know being ready to participate in clinical trials is is what you&amp;#39;re doing today in terms of being educated and kind of really understanding what these treatments are um and how they&amp;#39;re being developed and you know what&amp;#39;s um what some of the risks and benefits are going to be and really thinking about what it might mean to be involved in a clinical trial and uh you know being involved in a clinical trial is a big commitment it involves um you know going to a research center often multiple times um over a short period of time sometimes it can be you know five to eight visits in six months um and so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a big commitment personally for an individual and a family to make to to participate um and sometimes it could involve you know additional medical procedures it can involve um obviously taking an experimental medication and so really being educated and informed uh on the therapies that are in development and also you know what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s required of a clinical trial is incredibly important and and something that I think all families should take very seriously I needed to go thank you all foreign thank you Professor padolfo uh Dr Matt client thank you and uh Dr Miriam Rai because your commitment to this event is impressive thank you for the for that it is very important and this is I say it as a first step in a close cooperation which actually means that we um we can uh be a reliable and uh honest partner and this is something very uh this is something that we started four years ago we&amp;#39;ll build it daily and we can improve it and we are dedicated to invest resources in terms of clinical centers clinical sites and of course educating with uh participating in seminars our beloved doctors in this effort so thank you all for being here with us today and I think I think that this was a great panel thank you thank you great she&amp;#39;s online yes I&amp;#39;m sorry break in 15 minutes it&amp;#39;s my pleasure to introduce Dr Stephanie Sharkey who was supposed to present at the clinical research for Innovative treatments session she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s based in California San Diego Stephanie has earned her PhD in Paris and then she got specialized in stem cells and gene therapy at the scripts Institute in San Diego and after all she became associate professor at University of California San Diego a department of Pediatrics the division of genetics and she will speak today about her project and Fa development thank you thank you very much thank you everybody and thank you to the organizer for inviting me to this conference I&amp;#39;m sorry you know because of a time change I you know I had to um Talk a speaker later but uh so I will speak about the project that is still in particular stage for free cataxia and it&amp;#39;s the use of gene therapy but in this case we are calling ex Vivo gene therapy because we are using the hematocratic stem cells so I just show that not to talk about freak attacks here because you know I mean everybody knows but it&amp;#39;s just to point out that the issue with freak Ataxia as it was a very well said it&amp;#39;s like you have to to um uh fix the issue in many uh um in many organs in foreign you have to Target the brain the doctor and the spinal cord the heart and the muscle so to do so the approach we are using in my lab is like using hematopoietic stem cells which are the stem cells that reside in our bone marrow and that are the capacity of being able to migrate to all the tissues and be able to integrate there for a long time so um we use this approach of autologous a metabolic stem cell but we use from the patient and we demodify in a dish and after the patient goes through a chemotherapy to remove their own stem cells and then we Infuse back the the hematocratic stem cells where they will reside there for the rest of the life of a patient and this is not science fiction you know we this is in in a clinical trial for many disease already and in our own lab we really went from free clinical to clinical for another disease called cystenosis which is a multi-organ degenerative disease also and so as Dr Clem say it&amp;#39;s really important to know this uh how to do to go from bench to bedside and we have the capacity of doing that here so we went first in the mouse model of three cataxia and we used the the stem cells uh from a normal mice that were really green so we can track the cells after transplantation and we uh did a new radiation so it&amp;#39;s equivalent to the chemotherapy to remove those stem cells of other mice and we did an infusion and what we&amp;#39;ve seen was very impressive is that the the mice that I&amp;#39;ve received the free cataxia Master to have received the treatment of a metabolic stem cells at a normal locomotor activity that was equivalent to the white type mice that you can see here I hope you see my my cursor um the non-treated mice or the mice receiving cells from the disease mice were not you see that they are defective activity defective gate massage strengths and coordination whereas at the mice treated were equivalent to the white type price and we were um we checked the Dosa rule gonglia where the the neurons die and you see that the two controls are the two disease mice uh they there is a death of the neurons whereas the mice that receive a Wi-Fi payment operating stem cells we could preserve the the neurons we also showed that the fertixine expression was increasing the tissues in in the brain in the spinal cord uh and by the mitochondrial function was uh improved and so that was very you know uh we can tell me you know hematocratic stem cells will make blood cells so how can this works so we know now that the hematocratic stem cells the beauty of them is that they don&amp;#39;t have barrier they can go anywhere in the body um especially when there is like damage uh and so they uh can go here in the brain and you see all the green cells here the uh it&amp;#39;s very impressive a number of cells that we could see in the brain uh in the Dosa ganglia and spinal cord so again we do one bone marrow transplant and the cells do the job they go wherever they need to go and so what we showed is that we said become macro player cells is a sort of macrophages that we reside in the in the brain and what they do here they are in in Red so the material cells that contain the fat accent that we tagged with a A gfp fluorophore can now be seen in the neurons and we this is what we think is that the hematopoietic stem cells can become microbial in the brain spinal cord uh drg and we can transfer the products into the neurons to prevent the other but again the good thing about research is that they can also go to the heart and the muscle so we don&amp;#39;t need to do any of our anything else they do they they know where they have to go and if there is damage they go there and so you can see again so in the heart all the impressive number of hematopoxic stem cells in their heart and muscles and again we show that we have expression of the of a protaxine increases personal products in heart and muscle and improved of mitochondriac function so now we want to go to clinic and we want to then Gene correct the cells however uh the because the gene in the case of systems we add the Gene and we and it&amp;#39;s overexpressed but we know that in the case of fretaxing the overexpression can be uh toxic so we wanted to avoid that so what we are doing instead is a gene editing approach using crispr cas9 and we cut the elongation and so the good thing about that is that most of a patients with with free cataxia have this uh expansion mutation so the same approach can be used for all the patients it&amp;#39;s in in Antron so we can remove it it should it it&amp;#39;s not affecting the Gene and um and again because it&amp;#39;s we just cut the gene itself then uh it&amp;#39;s uh expressed in the same uh in the same manner so it&amp;#39;s a regular regulated manner so we showed first in the patient cells that was the line uh that if we do that and this is the optimized version uh so if for example for this patient one or patient two you can see that we if we do this uh Gene editing approach we end up with a over a not over expression but a increased expression of fat vaccine in recess from an mRNA level but also from a protein level foreign [Music] from the patient because now we also want to make sure that there is nothing from the hematopoietic stem cell from the patient that would present us to do that so we use uh volunteers I mean kindly participated to visa to this um study and uh out of five patients we um did this approach of removing the the ga repeat and we obtain a gene editing efficiency going from 12 percent to up to almost 56 percent and in this cells we showed that the vertexin expression was increased and the mitochondriac function was also improved so now we went back to the mice because now the next step is to show in a mouse model that we can have a disease uh improvement with this approach and all this step is what the FDA requires so we can this is called pharmacology so we have to show that this works in a mouse model so the good thing about the mouse model we are using is that if there is no fat mirin product scene but it has a human products in transgene so we express a fraction that contain 800 GA repeat so this is a perfect for our method because we are using exactly the same reagent then we will use in patient and so we showed that in their stem cells we can have we can cut the ga expression and when we transplant this says back in the mice we show that we have received a gene editing a search that ungrafted in the hematopoietic tissues that&amp;#39;s good but also in the tissues like spinal cord heart brain and skeletal muscle which are impacted by the disease but what we were impressed with is that the virginity efficiency you know in this tissue was limited you know but when do we look at the protein level the expression of the protein Francine comparing the non-edited mice that as control with a mesh receiving the stem cell that have been deleted we see a a really significant increase of the fratoxin protein expression in all the tissue that have been infected affected by by the disease and we also showed that there is a improved of methylchondriac function like this is a marker for mitochondria biogenesis which also is improved in the spinal cord and heart of a mice receiving the stem cell that have been related and a silver cardiac hypertrophy marker that was increasing the known in the disease mice are improved in the non in the mice receiving stem cells that have been edited and so um we are still the last thing we we&amp;#39;ve done is that we try to see if we could improve locomotor activity so in this new mouse model uh the the neurological defect is very minimal so but we found that the gate shows some um uh some kind of some parameter of the gate uh different in the in the disease mice and you can see for example the number of steps because we are smaller uh increase in the mice that are diseased and they also work with uh irregular irregular irregular everything and the pressure is also different but when we look and again it&amp;#39;s a small amount of mice so we hope to improve on this um uh is that we in the mice receiving those stems that have been edited have an improvement so we show like this is uh um uh improvement with research that have been deleted it so this is a I think a great step forward to be able to convince the idea so we could we move forward for a clinical later on and so this is what we want to do is text the stem cells from the patient uh Gene edited them in a dish put them back and we hope that they will be able to integrate into the disease tissue and be able to provide uh the the lp protein in all this tissue and I just want to uh to finish to thank all the lab members who works in um in the uh in this project all the patients who participated to this study uh all the community and all the funding the NIH Farah who has been a supporter of this project since the beginning and also for Australia thank you so much in fact any questions did you hear me the questions I cannot hear sorry I don&amp;#39;t hear anything from the University of Thessaloniki and I would like to ask if uh you or anybody else has tried in a similar experiment uh Mr kaimers themselves that may have a similar effect with heaven so that&amp;#39;s a very good question so in the project of you know this we&amp;#39;ve done we tried in parallel the hematopoietic stem cells the mesentina stem cells and the whole bone marrow cells and actually the amazing chemical stem cells have only a short-term effect beneficial effect and now we know that these cells actually integrate very short term into the the tissue they don&amp;#39;t stay at the in contrast to the metopatic stem cells so women document stem cells are really good for treating acute disease but they will not stay for a long time so it&amp;#39;s not good for the a chronic uh Gene disorder like precapaxia thank you we don&amp;#39;t have one more questions coming the microphone&amp;#39;s coming um thank you very nice data um I have a question um that at least my knowledge allergenic stem cell transplantation has not been used for fa&amp;#39;s treatment so um I I wonder how um your approach would provide cure in all affected issues I mean we know that bone marrow stem cells can differentiate in microglia and of course restore the the brain damage but I wonder how this can benefit the the heart that&amp;#39;s a good question so in the heart and muscles we have shown and we have shown that also for cystinosis and overs I&amp;#39;ve shown that is that they become macrophages resident macrophages so it&amp;#39;s the same time it&amp;#39;s the same family of a macrogly assets and um and when they they reside in the uh a tissue and they can transfer the the protein to the disease cells the same way even if this happened to the in the in the brain thank you Stephanie thanks a lot for joining today thank you thank you very much panelists who are still here I think we do have a short break before moving to the 30 minutes okay we do have a half an

what was it [Music] and the diagnosis took place three years later [Music] the rest I will carry on later on good evening I am free I am 15 years after my twin sister I was diagnosed as well from a virus that I suffered we searched and we found out that it was friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia but we didn&amp;#39;t know exactly what was wrong with us until today that we have learned we have found that and I am very happy that I am here with all of you that you are helping I would like to thank you very much can we move to you so Kyle would you like to carry on please when I was 19 years old uh I

you think we should discuss first give us you know if there isn&amp;#39;t for us well I want to hear what everyone is proud of you know there are we&amp;#39;re all proud of things in our lives no matter what no matter what we&amp;#39;re dealing with whether it&amp;#39;s friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia or a lot of other challenges in life and I&amp;#39;d love to hear what everyone is proud of sure so um I am proud that I have got to know all these people that are here today I would like to thank you once again I did not really expect [Music] this to happen today that are from since I was eight years old and I am now 15. I did not expect so quickly to get to know so many people that they have the same disease and I have met really fabulous people excellent people wonderful people thank you very much once again I am proud for many things for all these years that I am a patient with friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia first of all I am Pride because I am still fighting it is very important for us patients to fight but also for our parents we are trying and we are trying to make them understand that we fight hard that we are we uh we are going to go to the end all together and I am Pride that we made this Association that is to say 20 years after I have been diagnosed two years ago only it was that we made an association because in Greece and we found out in Greece that we have many many people we all United and we became a family it is extremely important to talk in library Facebook on the phone who is a males each and every one of us was alone but now we are all together I think it is extremely important and I am very proud that I participate in all these things I am very proud that we are a big family that we fight and we carry on fighting for all these things yeah this college let&amp;#39;s hear your your view Kyle this disease has taught me how to love myself more how to accept myself as the way I am with my Perfections at my imperfection if he has told me how it would be quite patient and remind me that slowly is the fastest way to get where I want to be foreign good evening once again I am proud because I didn&amp;#39;t know how much strength I had inside me and my family has helped me quite a lot in English and I didn&amp;#39;t believe that in the beginning I didn&amp;#39;t believe that we will manage that we will find a drug and I am proud that I am together with you here today and I am experiencing what I am experiencing really alexandross what are you proud what are you proud about good evening once again I am very proud that I got to know all these people that we speak together on a daily basis I am very proud of my parents my relatives my friends that they have supported me all these years and I am proud of myself that that I have never given up and I am still fighting but Pride as you know he&amp;#39;s a daily issue and you have to fight for it every day every night 24 hours a day thank you oh yeah later you can have questions sure but let&amp;#39;s have a question later okay uh so I think it&amp;#39;s my room to say for what I&amp;#39;m proud of so uh Implement problems I am proud of my family I am very proud of what has happened today all the effort that is taking place we have an umbrella and a storm which is called difficult access to people with uh um rare diseases but uh what Alexanders something said never give up never give up so what are you prideful I you know you guys really hit me right in the heart today just now um I&amp;#39;m you know in my head I was like all right I&amp;#39;m proud of all these things I&amp;#39;ve done um but I am so proud that I haven&amp;#39;t given up too I I feel like I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve heard that from people to just now in this session and I&amp;#39;m proud of that as well and just sometimes just getting to the next day is the challenge right and then we come upon a beautiful day and we get to meet friends and we we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re proud of what we do and it&amp;#39;s because we got through that really tough day that we get to experience the beautiful things in life and I guess and you know hearing all you say that that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m proud of as well is uh getting through the tough days to be able to get to the beautiful days nice nice thank you thank you for your for this very nice and wise words so what&amp;#39;s next is the first question so we&amp;#39;re all here together to get to a treatment and a cure for fa for us and for many of our friends and it takes all of us to contribute to be able to get there all of us pushing in the same direction and so I want to know how everyone contributes to the fa Community there&amp;#39;s so many different ways to contribute and you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not one thing it&amp;#39;s not two things there&amp;#39;s so many different ways I don&amp;#39;t want to hear how everyone contributes to the fa community sure let me translate here is foreign [Music] for the problems I am trying to make them understand [Music] do you believe that this way the community will get aware and what is happening yes Jessica well I tried to spread awareness about fa all over the world to the social media especially on my Instagram which is a pH dedicated to fa I share their daily routines how I dance how I work everything uh I also could delete meetings on Skype with the Benin and Kosovo group uh there are a lot of people from Albania Kosovo North Macedonia Montenegro we speak this the same language and we every month we do our meetings there on Skype and uh thank you thank you thank you Jessica so let&amp;#39;s move [Music] I am helping the community I believe all of you have seen a photograph of mine in Facebook the last three years three or four years I have taken photographs with banners I Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia do something about it therefore I have an active participation in the social media is a part of the society and it is very easy for us we&amp;#39;re in the Facebook or any page to see something to inform people to make people aware of what Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia is now from then on I have participated as a vice president it does amazing with my personal story I have given interviews to journalists in magazines periodicals on the internet and also a very significant part is education I have attended this course I have given speeches to students University students for my personal story I think this is extremely important for because they we let people know what are the rare diseases what is Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia and how is it to live and experience such a disease from then on I have participated with Kyle and Hara riding organizations and since I have been involved with amateurs for I am a champion in riding I I am I yes I spend a lot of time in some other Sport and it&amp;#39;s something that gave me more courage and it is something that I highly recommend to all the other patients to get strength and make a step forward and through sport I can and I am given the opportunity to talk about Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia that&amp;#39;s all uh every young person that I made I talk about my instability because it is obvious to everybody and that and that&amp;#39;s how I go forward I have no hesitation to talk about it I like talking about it to every human being I meet because this way we give strength and courage to other people to express themselves and take out of their heart something that it is rare as I have something rare to speak openly about it and let people know what this reality is and how to help them and as I was helped I made a step forward I am in this position now that I have always been dreaming of I would I was I always wanted I have always wanted to have a drug discovered in order to be treated in order to have a therapeutic approach Alexandra foreign speakers said I was speaking to people French acquaintances in at a younger age I went to schools the primary schools gymnasiums and I referred I mentioned the issues of my uh disease and therefore the people were informed about it they knew about me because I I was never isolated at home I was always going out into Villages small towns in near my city of course I faced some problems of accessibility however this never never stopped me I never gave up and I still visit to primary schools because the main problem is the young children that they do not understand what this is all about and young children must be educated because they are going to grow up into the society that&amp;#39;s it my own experience three years ago after the diagnosis I met Mr karadias and with three months we talked about friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia we made it was like a great campaign by Kyle and Chris Anthony was involved as well and we had the global recognization of ataxia we want to mobilize people and find a drug in order to achieve this people must know what you are talking about therefore to to try to mobilize and inform people is great because I am saying that because uh we feel sometimes that we are different that we are rare therefore what I am trying to contribute I I work in marketing is how to bring into yes the circle of ataxia people that want to help and but I meet a lot of people who want to help and I think this is a very positive approach Kyle how do you go how do you contribute not so share please the thing with us yeah I you know first of all I want to say that you know I think if some people see a doctor that hasn&amp;#39;t seen fa before they hear that there&amp;#39;s nothing you can do and we feel a little helpless but when we when we hear from all the people in this pin just in this panel today we can really understand that there is so much we can do and there&amp;#39;s so many ways we can help the community and get closer to a treatment um for me you know I follow what I love to do I just I love to be on my trike and I love to be cycling as much as possible and to be able to turn that into a way to unite the community and raise funds and push uh research for a treatment in a cure to forward is just so fulfilling and amazing to me um and to do that in the context of so many other people globally pushing in the same direction it&amp;#39;s just so incredibly encouraging to to be a part of this community thank you thank you thank you I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re pushing there once up for the community so much I think you have planned a bunch of questions but let&amp;#39;s do one more and then let&amp;#39;s try to get some questions from our guys that are on the room okay so hit us for the third time and then let&amp;#39;s go first time okay I think that one of the things that drives us is hope I think that&amp;#39;s a big part of life hope for the future and so what I want to know for everybody from everybody is what is your hope for the future I I hope that we are going to get this drug of course be active and help us that&amp;#39;s it nothing more nothing less yes it is a hope that we have a very beautiful girl punch My Hope for the future is the good quality of life that can unite us and the good quality of life of our families which includes of course good quality of life in includes a series of factors and the drug a series a series of things that we need so that we can all have good quality of life better access to a treatment access to drugs access to everything and of course to remain all of us unite and get and gather together that&amp;#39;s extremely important it&amp;#39;s kind of up to you um I truly believe in a treatment or a cure for all of us it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time I know that the time will come and when the time will come I will look above the sky and say this is for you to all the friends that we lost because of British ataxia the future with this drug I believe that it will come up and that&amp;#39;s where all my hopes are Alex I would like to say that of course it is self-evident that the drug or some kind of pharmaceutical help but the main thing is the way of life the quality of life because I see I live in a village in a very small town and the quality of life is not good at all I am away from a big city Athens thessalonica or some other big city life is of isolation and exclusion from everything the city of Arta where I live there is no access anywhere for me of course I do not have such a problem because someone will help someone will do something for me but this is not only for me we are talking about the rest of the people because it&amp;#39;s me today in the wheelchair so tomorrow there will be something someone else and the way this way of life must change radically in all cities towns villages small big medium size that no difference thank you very much apart from the long-term hope which is a drug 2023 to patients with clinical studies in Greece with one hope in another hope uh to have a drug and not to have access that is either what I dread and I am really looking forward to the next panel to listen to these things speaker of the microphone finally I have a hope that finally as it was said earlier on something organized that is to be given the opportunity in an organized way with the help of vasilis and the association to organize something in order to have one change what one chance more One Chance is one chance Kyle I My Hope for the future is very similar to everybody else&amp;#39;s I I hope and I&amp;#39;m confident that we will get to a treatment for fa because we&amp;#39;ll never give up that&amp;#39;s one thing I heard from everyone today and that&amp;#39;s what makes me confident that we will get there eventually and our quality of life is very improved I think by coming together and just sharing with each other our challenges and realizing that we&amp;#39;re not alone and so my hope for the future is that that continues and we continue to to uh uh enable a better quality of life for each other thank you thank you so Vasily let&amp;#39;s try to get some more stories from patience we had a great panel thank you all thank you Karen thank you Alex it&amp;#39;s a wonderful it was very touching it was fantastic so uh I think that this let&amp;#39;s say so George please make a question Okay so hello Kelly my friend in Facebook uh foreign out of a hundred percent doing your exercises how much does it help you I cannot confirm that how the gym that you are doing is helping you to Everyday Life with attraction how how what&amp;#39;s helping me I&amp;#39;m sorry how gymnastics ah I exercise yeah um I you know I think that exercise for me I think we can all feel it that if we don&amp;#39;t do it for a little while you can feel how it affects their body and I think that it is a matter of just keeping moving right and the more we do that I think a rising tide lifts all boats and so when we exercise I think it improves everything it improves the way we feel physically and the way we feel about ourselves just doing something for yourself I think uh improves self-confidence and while there&amp;#39;s so many physical um physical things about exercise that benefit the body there&amp;#39;s so much benefit to the mind and just the way you see yourself as well then you think up to you so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s uh salute and uh it was a great great session we will keep on fighting and working all together for this inspirational uh kids and patients you are in a family and Kyle thank you for being a role model for everyone else and you are an inspiration because you give uh you you get along you you you be in front and you and you give this let&amp;#39;s say opportunity to everyone to understand that as the girls told we if we will not speak for ourselves we cannot wait for others to speak for oh no on our behalf so thank you again thank you thank you very much foreign for the Greek community so uh for the translation need to be again okay I would like to say good evening to the last panel of the day Mr Colette who is the president of the National Committee of clinical research professor of Cardiology and Mr Philip dimitrios president of the National Organization of medicines and the professor at the capodistriana University of Athens also I would like to welcome the friend and the specialists in rare diseases of EMA pediatric committee specialists in clinical studies pediatricians member of 95 of herodis is the father of hermese thank you very much for being with us we would like to thank Mr Colette you have the floor thank you very much can you hear me well thank you very much for the invitation I am sorry that finally I couldn&amp;#39;t be there with you I have some thoughts the last session foreign president thank you very much for being with us I know you are abroad I know that you took some time to be with us it is important because all of us all the patients all the community that are together with us believes that we are in a very interesting times where a treatment may be close we don&amp;#39;t know the Horizon but it may be close therefore the role of the national medicine Association is very important thank you very much you have the floor good evening thank you very much for inviting me if there was no case that I would be absent I am a doctor as you know I am devoted to patients it is a great pleasure to be in the first conference for Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia but I am in France I I don&amp;#39;t want to delay you I have a very brief presentation which aims at telling us where we stand regarding the new treatment what do we expect and how we can bring these treatments much closer to us as soon as possible we should know that we have managed to bring faster than any other country in Europe treatment that patients need characteristic examples many others now Frederick&amp;#39;s attacks here because I know the conference is bilingual I have made my slides in English so Frederick&amp;#39;s a taxi I think all the distinguished the guests because you had an excellent agenda and specialized because it is rare is with these symptoms but what is important is that we are in a period of time that we get away from the standardized treatments and we have more targeted research and is targeting into these three categories what is of direct interest for the patients is the development of the gene therapy in order to have the fratoxin replacement as we know is decisive for the development of the disease we are in the time where we have a turning point the research in medical science diseases together with a pharmaceutical industry we will try to find treatments from research that is promoted from the universities and then to resets so if we see the map of research on the global level in the last 10 years we shall see that we have a lot of achievements for diseases that in the past were were thought to be not cured but things have changed radically and we are not talking about the Improvement of quality of life but for the survival of patients with good quality of life I consider that your disease is one of the coming forthcoming ones yeah we must have we must be a little bit patient why because the development of a drug is a process that it&amp;#39;s difficult from the Thousand molecules that we have in order to have in to have them on the stage of clinical research will be a few very few and very few of them will come to the end user now because we are talking about a disease that it is a rare one of excellent interest therefore in our mind we should have that we are all going to be together and our organization is ready to give you any kind of advice and as we did with all the patients we can do it together we can have a meeting put everything around on the table and see how we can have faster access to whatever is being produced I mean National level therefore as soon as we get away from this difficult part the development assessment of the molecules we get to the part of the clinical clinical research that Mr Colette which is going to talk about from this phase I think we can work together in cooperation with your doctors because we have specific centers that deal with Friedrich Ataxia so that we can get in touch with the companies and try to claim not only more studies but more patients from the target then what is of great importance we come to this party commercially available drugs we are at the initial stage the studies we have the studies but if we cannot have a very strict criteria to space it we will try to have two other options to the patients and this is early accessible patients that are excluded from the clinical studies we can talk with the companies so that we can create programs customized or group accessed what will we achieve we will achieve the earlier possible to offer treatment that potentially will be effective to our patients because if you see the pharmaceutical Market from the research clinical research to the introduction of the drug the American Licensing and the compensation which is the process of HDA and the negotiation committee there is a time limit that may be up to three years I do not consider that since we are talking about a small number of patients with heavy symptoms I don&amp;#39;t think we should wait all together we have to cooperate and find the easiest easier Solutions the easiest Solutions are clinical studies with which we can get in touch with the companies with the centers so that we can have a big number of studies or a big number of patients in one study so that means that all the patients must be informed and those that fulfill the criteria to be included in the study the national Medical Association and the ethical code work very fast on the other hand the patients that do not fulfill the criteria will go to the other pillar which is to claim a program of Early Access either individual or group one so that at the as to have the drug as soon as possible because I consider that we are closed in the development of a gene therapies and there is the third solution for those that do not fulfill their previous two uh criteria are the doctors themselves and if there is the need the necessity for the drug after it has gone through the clinical um the clinical research they can who can try to bring it through our request to help me so that it can come through the effect which is the subsidiary offers our organization you are not you are not alone foreign pandemic is the way in order to have a better level of life you are not alone all the Academia the research bodies the national bodies are with you the state is with you in order to offer you whatever it is best I I consider that we are going to have good news for you very soon perhaps we should have a meeting in order to organize the next steps thank you very much indeed hope for the best thank you president indeed this is extremely important all this uh framework that you gave us and your contribution and of course we are going to meet in order to plan together the next steps I think that today&amp;#39;s event shows that the Academia the scientists our doctors the companies that support this effort and they experiment and the patients and the regulatory authorities can be together I think all these things are very important thank you very much we have a very good experience you were always there and we hope that you will keep working with us so that we can have immediate access thank you Mr Colette I think is ready good evening hello again sorry about what happened what went wrong before so I was saying that uh I wanted to share with you some thoughts I don&amp;#39;t know whether you can see my slides now yes we can foreign ladies and gentlemen I think that it&amp;#39;s time with uh it&amp;#39;s time we think we thought it&amp;#39;s time we had some radical changes and in the way that we think in the field of research in the previous Century we had a lot of progress in this field and as a result we observed a huge reduction of mortality from natural causes as in Mr Philippe said This research was intensified furthermore I would say from the 90s onwards at a great degree however if we observe here I don&amp;#39;t know whether you can see the arrow you will see that in the last 20 years there has been um stability in mortality and life expectancy at Birth I have the data from the United Nations as from 1950s today to I have chosen three countries United States Switzerland and Greece and this is the curve of life expectancy it is similar in the three countries let&amp;#39;s take Greece for example and do you see that after the big progress or in the previous Century the last 20 years we see that this development has lost its potential it&amp;#39;s dynamic and also we have a huge increase in the number of clinical research impressive one we see in the last 20 years in 2000 up today you see the increase in the number of clinical results in clinical studies however till today humanity is fighting with the suspects so that is to say cancer cardiovascular diseases and of course rare diseases that we are talking about today as a number are over 7 000 rare diseases and in total they are not that rare because they are on average seven percent of diseases in Europe here in the graph we see the private funds that have been given for the research and we see that the cancer of course has got the biggest number and then we have the other um and the other diseases and the rare diseases are not present in this graph in order to tackle this problem since 1983 in the United States we had a definition of the rare disease then we had the Japan with a definition and then the rest of the countries the European Union last which defined what a rare disease is and institutionalized what is Orphan treatment and do you see here the prerequisites and addresses to the pharmaceutical industry aiming at attracting the funds for Orphan drugs for rare diseases these companies that choose to have these results they have some privileges consulting services from EMA and local agencies so they are relieved from some taxes and other Privileges and of course the most important one is the exclusive distribution of the drug for 10 years but now this is a private sector now let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s see the funds from the public sector let&amp;#39;s take the country United States into the funds from 1994 till today from NIH and we see after the big increase from the 90s that we said up to the beginning of our Century we see a reduction a decrease of the funds in total here we can see 2018 the public funds in the United States for medical research the number is huge it&amp;#39;s 14 billion dollars however it&amp;#39;s much less of the money for military equipment but even this money the 43 live are not being are not given easily the researchers in the United States are obliged to write proposals on a constant basis in order to carry on the research and to estimate that 50 of the researchers time is writing proposals things are worse however there is something consoling very small but of the percentage of the fund for research derives from non-profit organizations or Institute this is the black one the black color was the one and the axials of the association for friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia it gives us a hope that this course of action can be can carry on in Greece I&amp;#39;m not going to Tire you let&amp;#39;s go back to the initial question why although we have this research the expectancy the life expectancy is not increasing significantly also we have a scientific Personnel very well trained and educated this is data from UNESCO which shows the number of postgraduate postdocs internationally that are trained in a specific Center you see we have a huge leap in the number and the main one is we see the number of Publications in medicine here you can see this is impressive up to 1990 we had a little increase in from 1990 we have an exponential increase into the number of medical Publications in recent years only they are more than all the period of time since the second world war until the beginning of this Century why why is this happening this Paradox is happening the reasons are very many however I believe that one reason that I want to highlight is the clinical researches promotion I believe that political researches are the king of uh results very often those who are taking place without adequate pre-clinical data without sufficient adequate support to the clinical studies are the king and the biggest part of the research ninety percent of the funds are given for clinical studies and only 10 for pre-clinical studies and how is it possible of these Paradox we are in society of knowledge and why are we lagging behind because there is a big difference between knowledge and comprehension understanding comprehensible understanding means the plethora of knowledge that we possess to connect it with to to connect the puzzle and the shape up a hypothesis who it&amp;#39;s a hypothesis or a supposition will be studied in pre-clinical periods of time and on clinical clinical research and there must be we should not have a gap we should have a Channel of communication of pre-clinical research all the support with the hypothesis to be trialled there is a clinical research is not a cyclical research as a yes or a no or a P value the questions that arise from the clinical research is to get back to the basic research to the pre-clinical research and be studied uh from scratch and does Mr Philippe said I think this field is the field in which we have the pharmaceutical industry and the universities commit it is the sector that they have to cooperate these two bodies aiming at a progress and the common good and I think it&amp;#39;s they both can gain they can get the bad things of the academic Society who is perhaps the research is not uh useless and science has a surprises and of course the universities they can contribute and they can take a lot from the pharmaceutical companies their organization the targeting and so they can get out of the crisis that we have in universities not only Greece I believe but globally and something last I believe that the history has taught us that progress in the field of medical science and research and technology in general must go hand in hand with the development of values and if there is if these two things do not go hand in hand then we have a crisis in culture in the crisis in value let&amp;#39;s go back in 1961 where two American scientists discovered the vaccine for polo the vaccine had was very cheap and as a result millions of children saved and let&amp;#39;s compare it with today&amp;#39;s situation with the vaccines for coffee the president ladies and gentlemen I think the message of the conference is that together we are going to win says it all all the stakeholders public private sector the state the auditing the universities the Academia must unite for the common good for the progress into the medical biological research thank you very much good morning and I believe indeed that the exemplary changes will be put into practice thank you very much thank you Mr colettis I am sure that we approved today that together we will manage because many times we say things that they sound nice but when you invest on this when you make steps of cooperation then you become a valuable collaborator through continuous Improvement of the effort and through actions we can have a really hopeful result because we have both of you here today I would like to raise a question because we have many participants from our area this is not like Belgium that the clinical trials are integrated at hospital yourself so we can have a hot spot area regions that will be beneficial or neighboring countries in the community how far away is this idea to be implemented where is this issue how who can be a more International Center we have requests from India to participate to have patients participate in clinical trials this can be achieved it is feasible without we raise the all the legal and the Practical issues I think that this is not very far away that&amp;#39;s the years the introduction of the patient is not the problem we don&amp;#39;t care whether the patient comes up or not Macedonia or Grace Etc the problem is that we have not followed the the course of the other countries only in recent years we have exerted future for in order to create the conditions here to calculated Etc so we see the following although we have many clinical trials in numbers that the number of patients that participate is very small why because we&amp;#39;re not fully organized that so what I would see as a first phase is to have the legislative framework of our clinical trials at hospitals we have some interventions there the second thing is to train the staff because don&amp;#39;t forget clinical trials are completely different we&amp;#39;re talking about a high quality provision of services certified so the centers must be certified the specific training and control is required at the same time the training of the staff and the third point is that the patients should be informed because it&amp;#39;s not only you that try to find the solution many patients in the pastor did not the same clinical trials are positively they thought that they were beginning one of the good things the positive things that the covet pandemic gave us is that a familiarizes with the idea of the clinical trial itself so we need a gradual approach infrastructure Personnel stuff and patients many things have been done and we will continue to do many things we need your cooperation don&amp;#39;t forget that so um what would you say and we put the draw from these meetings today is to coordinate a meeting of all in all parties and the companies that are active in clinical trials because we need specialized centers in order to have the clinical trials of the registration for the other diseases we needed the two months only if we cooperated the things we move forward you have informed your people for the therapeutic choices and all the data for the patients themselves because it is disease the role of the carers is of crucial importance thank you very much Mr colettis Mr filippou for your contribution operation offer of course we are going to cooperate do our very best so that our patients will see that the state is standing by them thank you very much good night I think that this was a very happy day you have a picture from the Pediatric Committee of EMA I think that it covers the big part of the spectrum starting from the symptomatic treatment up to clinical trials basic research and also we listen to the stories of our patients and the regulatory framework what is the conclusion the message that you can draw I think that it is a unique uh confidence unique meeting because you are unique our children are Unica and this means that we keep trying because I&amp;#39;m 10 years ahead of you two messages from our community which one children have different names and different faces what I can tell you is that from the communities of DNA high technology 80 is more than 70 percent everything that is new in the development all over the world is a foreign I can give you a message that&amp;#39;s 40 years later the last 10 years we started with seven clinical trials and nowadays we have 70. clinical trials in the USA Europe all over the world there is cooperation between our associations the second thing is that the last attemption there were very small groups for population but what increased their life expectancy expectancy by seven years regulators you as patients and we as parents you the carers you have to play your own part and our job is to fight for tomorrow these are my final words I was very proud to be with you thank you for the invitation to the same family I think that with this optimistic message we are going to end today&amp;#39;s conference thank you very much all of you that attended the confidence although it is quite late we would like to thank the pharmaceutical companies that supported us the Physicians of the researchers and our family is stronger every day better every day thank you very much I would like to thank all the brave people but said here Mr Karate yes everybody that participated in the success of today&amp;#39;s conference and of course I will ask you not to say this for my success I work for institute the pastor Institute I am here for you an Excellency Center the center of excellence therefore a neuro degenerative disease they serve me personally I have worked for many years but various hospitals and I have experienced study a day of stigma personalization of the hope and despair but I&amp;#39;m here today because Ataxia visited my family 40 years ago diagnosed at the age of 13 and now aged 53 and uh although we talk about life expectancy is quite small for this diseases and this was opportunity to meet Mr characters and all of you internet technology writing for you right these are the things that this person does I have experienced I repeat again ataxia because of this member of my family and I know the feelings of the family said that have to face the idea of the chronic disease and the unknowns two things of emotions in the same day [Music] self despair hope and despair if the drug that we&amp;#39;re expecting two days is not here and many times this is a threat for the family possession the first drug that you have is a family love support all the members and the second thing is the quality of life and access that we live in a city that does not have a specific Parts a pedestrian for pedestrians so we have what you think of all the parameters for our lives the persons that face their mobility issues have a must be able to go around in the city also we are vulnerable to people that are self-hop I have experienced this as well and this is my conclusion never stop trusting science and never become a victims of people that are not scientists and then try to sell treatments ask for the help of your Physicians and be sure that very soon you are going to have the drug that you&amp;#39;re expecting foreign I am committed that everything that you may need I am here to help you to stand by you I don&amp;#39;t move very easily but today it was very much moved by yourself",

    "transcript": "around Insurance specialty pharmacies patient assistance programs insurance insurance insurance and um there&amp;#39;s been one amazing human who has answered all of my questions um sometimes I ask her six to 10 questions in a day I&amp;#39;ve asked her the same question probably six times um and she&amp;#39;s incredibly patient with me and so I asked her if she would be willing to come and share with you the knowledge that she has um about getting an approved medicine to an individual when there&amp;#39;s a specialty pharmacy um and it&amp;#39;s a rare disease medication and So Lisa flurry uh is here to you know give you an overview and this her presentation is not going to be specific to Sky Claris she&amp;#39;s going to talk more broadly about how this process works when there&amp;#39;s a new medication in a rare disease community and you&amp;#39;re not just having your doctor write a prescription and pick it up at your local CVS and all of the the different players in the system um and Lisa is also open for questions once she&amp;#39;s done kind of giving us an overview so with that Lisa FL hello everybody and good afternoon thank you very much for uh inviting me Jen to speak and I&amp;#39;ve really enjoyed the conversations we&amp;#39;ve had so far um as Jen said I&amp;#39;m here today to talk about specialty drug access and um I&amp;#39;m responsible for patient services at um Riata and as of two weeks ago I&amp;#39;m now part of the Biogen family which is very very exciting um personally I can share that um we really would love to see this product be available to patients in other countries and we know that Biogen has the uh the resources and the footprint to do that faster than um the the small But Mighty and Scrappy Riata team could have done and in my position I&amp;#39;m really excited about the potential to enhance the services that we&amp;#39;re able to offer our patients given the the precedent of um Biogen services for their rare diseases so um they&amp;#39;ve opened us opened up their arms and welcomed us into their family and um really looking forward to what we can do together in the next um you know next several weeks and months so what I want to focus on today is access to Specialty drugs this is new for a lot of people in this room you waited a long time for a treatment you waited a long time for FDA approval you sat through a lot of delays to get to approval then for product availability but now our product is here and yes it&amp;#39;s the first but it won&amp;#39;t be the only specialty drug and we hope and based on what I heard today from the other manufacturers and the great work that Farah is doing there hopefully will be many more treatments available in the future um but as Jen alluded to Specialty drugs don&amp;#39;t follow the same path of the antibiotic you get when your kid gets strepped for the ninth time like happens in my household um you don&amp;#39;t just go to your CVS to get Scott Claris um so I want to really focus on the um just that what this process looks like so what I want to leave you with at the end of my discussion today is an overview of specialty drugs the role of specialty pharmacies and what the process looks like to get your insurance to approve the product and have it end up on your doorstep so we&amp;#39;ll also talk about the other steps including outof pocket costs as well as just the overall timeline so let&amp;#39;s go ahead and get started um so what is a specialty medication so in short it&amp;#39;s a product that generally treats a rare or complex condition are they going are they going okay there um so these are products that treat uh rare complex conditions sometimes there&amp;#39;s special handling um or some additional monitoring for these products and again speaking in general terms when I&amp;#39;m talking about specialty drugs I&amp;#39;m referring to the subset of those that are self-administered so they&amp;#39;re oral products you take at home down the road Road you know you may see injectables or something that are you don&amp;#39;t have to go to the doctor to get um these products are used by relatively few patients so if you think about how many retail pharmacies there are it just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense for these products to be stored on shelves but more importantly they need to be handled a little bit more carefully and so you will see that there are specialty pharmacists that provide a little bit of a higher level of service and in large part that&amp;#39;s due to their accreditation as a specialty pharmacy so you might find that um your drug counseling is a little more intensive um they may offer you additional services to help you understand the disease State and the the product and help address any barriers that may come up whether they be um Financial or otherwise so these specially pharmacies um of course biologics may be familiar uh there&amp;#39;s also a CREDO opum Alliance Rx and Drug manufacturers may elect to have an exclusive Specialty Pharmacy Arrangement where there&amp;#39;s just one Pharmacy that distributes product or there may be a limited network of a handful of pharmacies but the idea is to really offer patients consistency uh so that all patients are offered the same services and I&amp;#39;ll also put out there that um these specialty drugs aren&amp;#39;t found elsewhere in the internet for example so you may see certain products listed on good RX or blink RX or any of these other sites that report to get you better prices and oftentimes there are actually fraudulent sites that claim to sell the product if the manufacturer has said publicly on their website that they are distributed only through a certain Pharmacy that&amp;#39;s probably the best case and unfortunately we just have to accept there are still bad actors out there trying to um to get your money somehow so I would just caution you and I also thank Jen for bringing one of those instances to my attention where I got to work with our legal to send a really nasty letter to a website and we got that taken care of so that felt felt like an achievement um okay so I was listening to a lot of the presentations today and a common theme tends to be this you know it varies it depends so I&amp;#39;m going to continue to provide you with that uncertainty in this portion of the presentation because there&amp;#39;s so much variability when it comes to Insurance there are hundreds of health care plans out there and together there are thousands of policies that can be put in place and put in front of you as as an individual with insurance so in general terms there are some common themes that we want to keep in mind um I&amp;#39;ll talk about prescription benefits because that&amp;#39;s typically where uh espcially Pharmacy products end up um so formularies are the list of drugs that an insurance company will cover and they make certain commitments to evaluate new drugs after approval and add them to their formulary and generally we see that private insurance and Medicaid plans will do this within around 6 to 12 months and we see Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Market Marketplace plans do this a little bit faster uh so you may be asking yourself why why would it take them so long to add a product to formulary and uh that is because insurance plans have different committees that will review all the available data about a product and then make a determination about how to cover that drug and they&amp;#39;re going to look beyond the FDA approved label they&amp;#39;re going to look at everything out there including the the clinical trial design and then they&amp;#39;ll use that information and any other Publications to determine how they want to cover this product for their patients that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that no patients are getting access in that intern process it just means that they&amp;#39;re having to get uh what&amp;#39;s called a medical exception and it&amp;#39;s a manual review that can take a little while so people in this room may have experienced that where even after the drug was available there was still a delay in getting Insurance approval because they&amp;#39;re waiting for their insurance to make a decision um so we&amp;#39;re starting to see in our experience um now that we&amp;#39;re six months from launch that more and more plans have added the product to formulary but there are some that still haven&amp;#39;t so say it with me now it varies so we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll revisit that shortly um okay so prior authorizations are really common you probably have dealt with this for some sort of product or service whether it be physical therapy or another product um that you&amp;#39;ve tried to acquire and a prior authorization is typically required for specialty drugs at the bare minimum because your insurer wants to know that you meet the requirements as specified by the FDA different insurance companies will set their own policies according to what their aforementioned uh committee has decided as appropriate and so that may require some additional information for your doctor or sometimes for you to submit to your insurance company just a hypothetical example of a product that I may or may not be close with is that um sometimes the payer may ask for genetic testing results they may want some lab work and they may even want to see the clinical notes from a recent visit just to understand what treatments have been tried so far and so you can imagine it&amp;#39;s a lot of work for your doctor they don&amp;#39;t have somebody just sitting there gladly passing information back and forth to an insurance company and so to the extent possible and there are many restrictions around this but pharmacies are able to assist in trying to streamline that communication to the doctor&amp;#39;s office to um just make it a little bit easier for them to understand what needs to be submitted okay so let&amp;#39;s operate in a world where your insurance company has given you approval and that&amp;#39;s great uh now we&amp;#39;re worrying about the out- of pocket expenses so when it comes to cost sharing for specialty drugs um there&amp;#39;s a couple different avenues that payers can take sometimes they will just set a flat co- payment just a flat dollar amount regardless of what the drug costs there&amp;#39;s another type of cost sharing called co- insurance and um that&amp;#39;s just a percentage of the total drug cost and we see in private insurance plans it&amp;#39;s really about 50/50 just depending on the benefit design because wait for it it varies it depends so what you&amp;#39;ll see in Medicaid plans um they typically have a very low cost sharing amount um but Medicare is its whole other thing that um we&amp;#39;re going to talk about here on another slide um but I just want to pause for a second and just acknowledge that Medicare generally is thought of as the program for Americans older than 65 but it is also available to individuals who receive Social Security disability income and after two years those individuals then become eligible for Medicare so it&amp;#39;s not uncommon for people under 65 who are on specialty drugs to be covered by Medicare so I talked a few minutes ago about this formulary where the insurance companies determine what products they&amp;#39;re going to cover and then they use a tearing structure to align the drugs to the out-of-pocket costs so very typical and again wait for it it varies um you could have anywhere between two to five tiers on a plan depending on the specific design but I&amp;#39;m going to use this example of a four tier structure where tier one are your generics tier two often are the preferred Brands um tier three may be a non-preferred brand that didn&amp;#39;t get the right contract with the insurance company to get on tier two and then there might be a dedicated specialty tier for products such as um specialty drugs so this formulary is generally updated every year so this is the time of year when um you are often asked to start looking at open enrollment with your insurance company if you&amp;#39;re at a using employer coverage there&amp;#39;s generally not much to choose from but you will want to pay attention to your cost sharing for that specialty tier and if you have access to the formulary you would want to look to see if the drugs you take are covered on the other hand if you get your drugs through Medicare Part D or from the Affordable Care Act Obamacare exchange plans you may have more to choose from and so you can take a a broader look and to make sure you have some comprehension about what you might be looking at when the plan year changes over come January okay so I warned you about Medicare so um here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s the deal on Medicare um I think it&amp;#39;s really important before I go into this complexity that um up until 2003 there were was no drug benefit whatsoever under Medicare so p patients who had Medicare just went without or they paid cash if they didn&amp;#39;t have any other source of insurance um and then in the Medicare modernization Act of 2003 which went into effect in 2006 um our Congressional leaders met for many many hours and days and produced this mess this this monstrosity of a of a cost sharing structure and this was the result of um political compromise and it doesn&amp;#39;t make a lot of sense but um let me just talk a little bit about the design of it so these numbers have been updated every year so what you see here is the standard benefit for Part D um in 2023 so patients who have Medicare right now may have this structure but of course there&amp;#39;s hundreds of plans so it varies thank you okay so the deductible phase is just over $500 and that&amp;#39;s where the patient is responsible for 100% of that cost before the plan kicks in and then at the $56 is where the initial coverage period starts and the patient has a 25% Co Insurance until we get to what&amp;#39;s labeled here as the coverage Gap but does anybody remember it being called the dut hole do you remember that yes so um a few years ago there was legislation that modified the doughnut hole because that was literally once you reached a set dollar amount medic was like just kidding you don&amp;#39;t have insurance anymore um so there was legislation passed where manufacturers now pay towards that closing that doughnut hole and so the number in 2023 is $7,400 so once you hit that dollar amount you&amp;#39;re out of the doughnut hole and you&amp;#39;re into what&amp;#39;s called catastrophic coverage and the benefit design specifies that uh patients have a 5% Co insurance which seems small small but back when this was designed there were not nearly as many specialty drugs on the market as there are today which is wonderful that more rare diseases are getting treatments where they didn&amp;#39;t exist before but this doesn&amp;#39;t really work in today&amp;#39;s environment because 5% of a lot is a lot and it&amp;#39;s still Out Of Reach for many patients but in reality um if you look at the Medicare population as a whole only a small percentage of patients even reach the doughnut hole let alone go into catastrophic coverage but patients with specialty drugs they don&amp;#39;t just hit catastrophic coverage they tend to get there really fast and stay there for the rest of the year so that is a problem and something that has been discussed in Congress for many many years um so I&amp;#39;ll talk in a minute about what&amp;#39;s around the corner okay so what is happening here is that the inflation reduction act that was passed a little over a year ago included some Provisions about Medicare that really have a positive effect on patient access and so there&amp;#39;s a lot going on on this slide but I&amp;#39;m just going to S sum it up by saying that in 2024 that 5% catastrophic coverage is going away and once patients get through the doughnut hole they will owe nothing for the rest of the year um again this resets every January but it is a positive U development for patients who get their drugs from Medicare um the other thing that is happening is that in 2025 the doughnut hole is going away as well and the cap is being implemented at $2,000 a month or a year and that $2,000 a year has to be spread out equally throughout the entire year so what that means is that in 2024 you might be hit upfront in the year with a really high deductible and initial coverage period and 25% the dnut hole but then you&amp;#39;re done that&amp;#39;s going to be about $3,200 but in 2025 that cap is 2,000 and they have to spread it out throughout the year um there&amp;#39;s a lot to be defined about how this is going to actually work because um Congress was really quick to write that legislation and then it got in the hands of Medicare Implement and they were like hm I don&amp;#39;t know how to do this so we&amp;#39;ll find out more soon um we will let you know as soon as we know because this is all very new but regardless um this is a really really positive development considering how things are right now okay let&amp;#39;s see here um okay I&amp;#39;m going to talk a little bit now about affordability options that may be available uh pretty common for manufacturers of specialty drugs to offer co-pay cards to help offset the patient cost sharing um patients who have private insurance maybe offer these co-pay cards but there are government regulations that prohibit manufacturers from helping patients who have any government insurance so a manufacturer could not give a co-pay card to a patient with Medicare or with Medicaid for that matter um so Medicaid patients have pretty low copain ments um but for Medicare this cost sharing structure is is problematic for a lot of patients and the Medicare program does offer something they call um extra help or the low-income subsidy and um patients who are eligible based on income and assets automatically get this extra help uh if they have Medicaid and Medicare and then their insurance benefits for prescription coverage will go through their me Medicare Part D but the cost sharing is really low um but Medicaid Eligibility varies by state there&amp;#39;s our magic word again it varies so if you have the income eligibility for the low-income subsidy which is 150% of the federal poverty level and you meet the asset threshold um you could apply for the low-income subsid and get reduced cost sharing for all of your drugs um that information is available on the Social Security Administration website if you are not eligible and would like to find out if you might be able to receive that assistance um but there&amp;#39;s some patients that don&amp;#39;t qualify for extra help and they still cannot afford their out-of- pocket costs so Manu or some patients don&amp;#39;t have prescription coverage or any coverage at all and so some manufacturers do offer patient Assistance programs for those patients that are either uninsured or you know functional uninsured is the term that might be appropriate for those with insurance but it&amp;#39;s still unaffordable so you would want to check with the manufacturer of that program to see what options may be available um so this is just a quick summary um because I just wanted to share some additional good news again that patients with Medicare who get their prescription drugs through part D are going to see some positive changes over the next couple years starting um up in January with the cap on out-of-pocket spending an elimination of catastrophic coverage and then further um availability of that low-income subsidy it used to only be 135% of patient or patients who are at 135% of the federal poverty level could get access to the low-income subsidy but now it&amp;#39;s at 150% so a few more patients may be able to get that those full benefits from the low-income subsidy and then of course of course in 2025 that&amp;#39;s the bigger C change where the the payment plan will go into effect and the products should be more affordable and accessible for patients who get their drugs through Medicare um okay so let&amp;#39;s talk about timelines now um so what does it process look like between when your physician writes the prescription and when it ends up on your doorstep so as a first step the the prescription once your physician determines you&amp;#39;re an appropriate candidate for a drug will need to be sent to wherever the manufacturer designates it could be especially Pharmacy or some manufacturers have their own in-house support programs or administered through a vendor and typically it&amp;#39;s not just a prescription sent in there&amp;#39;s a form that has a lot of other information that the insurance company will need and so the pharmacy says let&amp;#39;s go ahead and collect that up front to minimize the back and forth and often times there&amp;#39;s consent as well for the physician and for the patient to opt into the program and get the services so that form gets sent into the pharmacy and then the pharmacy does the work of contacting the insurance company to find out is the drug covered what&amp;#39;s required and um they will work back and forth with The Physician Office to get that information documented um th this is where there&amp;#39;s a lot of potential for delays the insurance company may ask for something The Physician doesn&amp;#39;t have like for example if there&amp;#39;s genetic testing that the physician doesn&amp;#39;t have on file but the patient has and there&amp;#39;s a whole you know Chase going on to find that um sometimes the insurance company will deny it because they made the decision that they don&amp;#39;t think a certain subset of patient should be eligible for the drug but the physician working with the patient um can appeal that denial and continue to try to fight for coverage um which you know that unfortunately happens more often than it should I think there&amp;#39;s multiple levels of appeals that are possible to get the insurance company to pay uh for a product um and the success rates of course will vary but it&amp;#39;s something we don&amp;#39;t give up on easily if there&amp;#39;s a denial um I will also say that a lot of uh all manufacturers do work to meet with insurance companies ahead of time to educate them about a disease State and then once the drug is approved they go and educate about the drug and try to help um I don&amp;#39;t want to say I&amp;#39;m not saying influence I&amp;#39;m saying to help make sure that the companies have as much information available to them as possible to ensure that the coverage determinations are appropriate um but again there&amp;#39;s no guarantee that plans are going to put in place policies that um will align with the the FDA approved label so that&amp;#39;s why all of this insurance back and forth is um is necessary so once the approval is granted the co-payment or co- Insurance collection time happens and that&amp;#39;s where co-pay cards may be applied if the patient is eligible or screening for drug Assistance programs may be possible depending on the situation and then the pharmacy will do um an onboarding call where they will provide some education and counseling and information and then work to arrange the the shipping destination so if you would want to make sure that a patient is home to receive a package or to um have it shipped to a place of work or somewhere else where it can be securely received and it comes via FedEx or UPS typically um in our situation it&amp;#39;s either whichever one is best suited for your particular geography um and then they will call you a couple weeks ahead of time for your next refill to ensure that um you&amp;#39;re ready to receive another shipment but this is the this is the what we call the happy path where this could all happen inside of a week in a perfect situation uh but in reality sometimes it takes longer and there&amp;#39;s obstacles but um I can tell you that at Riata now Biogen we are committed to making sure that appropriate patients have access to therapy and working within our compliance guidelines will um provide assistance whenever possible so that&amp;#39;s all I have for you today but I&amp;#39;m happy to clarify any questions or answer anything you may have so um at Riata when we were setting up the um the trade and distribution Network we did select biologics as the exclusive Specialty Pharmacy um that is in place for now and will continue to be the source of um of access for sky clairis for the time being and any changes will be communicated um I work with patients a lot with specialty chemotherapy meds and sometimes there&amp;#39;s um an issue with who is prescribing so like would it have to be prescribed only by the neurologist like we&amp;#39;ll have I do neurooncology so sometimes if we order a specialty um like seizure Med that&amp;#39;s new the oncologist can&amp;#39;t order it that we have to send them to a neur ologist to order it like do you know how that&amp;#39;s going to work with this medication yes thank you it&amp;#39;s a good question um and unfortunately I&amp;#39;m going back to my tagline it varies but um it really does there are um the published policies from the payers that I&amp;#39;ve seen most of them use language about must be prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist and um we know a lot of a lot of patients don&amp;#39;t have easy access to the doctor to Dr Lynch or to any of the other Specialists and so they may see a primary care physician um but it really just depends on the particular insurance plan if they will allow that or if they will require a specialist directly to submit the prescription but the pharmacy will identify that and then communicate with that prescriber to make other arrangements oh I wish I could give you a good answer for that one but um I I don&amp;#39;t know and I don&amp;#39;t know if anybody from medical wants to speak to that and fortunately I I&amp;#39;m not sure I in my role I can only speak about us access and Commercial availability um but I I do know that there has been a lot of um interest from from Canada and I I can I would suggest that you call and speak to medical information because I think they might be able to give you a better answer thank you oh Wendy do you want to come up do we have a mic yeah yeah we can do a duet it&amp;#39;ll be great I&amp;#39;m hoping my answer is worthy of walking all the way up from the back of the room to answer so if I heard the question the question was on xus and um maybe I&amp;#39;ll tie it back to the question from earlier as well on the Pediatric piece we know these are the two key aspects of questions that have been a theme throughout um being here on stage so there is some public public information um available going back to the Pediatric piece on clinical trials.gov on what we&amp;#39;re looking to do to move that study forward I talked about Milestones previously as far as steps we need to take to advance that a lot of this is around conversations with um the appropriate stakeholders as well so we hear you loud and clear as far as the unmet needs so for those two aspects um those will continue to be priorities for us moving forward as we think through um The Next Step so again not a very specific answer but I just want to reiterate that those are the areas that we hear from you that are top priority so we&amp;#39;ll continue to drive those conversations forward for you all getting mean blinkies here hey there so um I have a US question so there are um families that I know so this is me I&amp;#39;m asking for somebody I&amp;#39;m asking for a friend um I have lots of those um um but they they have Medicaid and that six to 12 month thing that you were putting up on the screen so is that every US state has the six to 12 month with Medicaid in particular or are there some that are fast-tracked and others not and how does that whole thing work well it varies yeah so I can tell you okay so go to New York then well I I can share with you that um we did have some states that came online very quickly after product became available meaning that they would let claims go through there were some that just got added October 1st and there&amp;#39;s still a handful of states that are holding out but we just keep throwing the claims at them hoping that they just give up find the answer to that you you get a you get a prescription and you send it into the pharmacy and let them fight it yes all right yeah the not you as a p you have the physician send in the start form just to clarify the physician should still send the start form in if yeah yeah yeah and you you keep appealing you you keep appealing yeah keep appealing yes and if you have challenges I would suggest contacting the the program the pharmacy if there&amp;#39;s some that are stuck because sometimes they&amp;#39;re stuck because other reasons it could be covered but that plan is denying it for a patient so there thanks to Lisa I&amp;#39;ve learned a few things and the Medicaid is again so every single state is going to potentially have their Medicaid approvals at different times and they might not all have the same uh requirements and that is a place where advocacy can play a big role and so Farah&amp;#39;s been working with the Riata Biogen team to understand when specific states are going to be reviewing Sky Claris and what what their managed care plans are looking at for requirements and so for example last month Michigan had their meeting and we were alerted that one of the pro two of the provisions were going to be problematic one is they were going to require mvars exam and they were going to require a review at six months with demonstrated Improvement to continue so Farah put together a letter to explain why that was inconsistent with the FDA label and the experience from the clinical trial and put forward alternative suggestions for them to monitor clinical benefit or clinical outcome and then we have patient families also testify yes at the p&amp;amp;t meeting they were discussing about 10 or 12 drugs at that meeting the only one that got discussed by the committee was ours and they decided that their recommendation was going to be to remove mfrs and extend it out to 12 months that would not have happened had our community not been at the meeting and explained their experience so Jake and Clair and Moren were there and explained like our local neurologist doesn&amp;#39;t do an MF fars we go to Philadelphia to participate in research they do an MFS but the local neurologist doesn&amp;#39;t do Nars you know things like that they didn&amp;#39;t have to be experts in the data they were experts in their own experience and Helen Madden are patient engagement manager found out literally like six days ago Arkansas Missouri and Arkansas Missouri and Nevada are all coming up next week so we have like less than a week&amp;#39;s notice to prepare um to participate in those State meetings and we&amp;#39;re reaching out to our fa families in those states to also participate and so this is a place where your voice is going to matter we&amp;#39;re going to try and reach out to you every time we know that there&amp;#39;s an opportunity for this um because it can make a real difference the other thing I&amp;#39;ll say is the appeals process is unfortunately a part of the process right it&amp;#39;s always easy for somebody to just say no and sometimes they&amp;#39;re saying no for the wrong reasons whether it be the mvar reason or age or a age meaning people over 40 That&amp;#39;s because that was in the clinical trial um or even some have said no because of pz cavis so Kellen has prepared an appeal letter a sample that you can share with your doctor that will help them write a letter that addresses some of those issues and why those issues are not in the FDA label and a little bit more education about fa and the data to take some of the burden off your physician and give them the information that they need to file the appeal so those are just some ways that you know as we&amp;#39;re learning as we go through this process that we&amp;#39;re trying to be able to help um we H you have to email us yeah biologics has it too oh biologics has it too we&amp;#39;re sharing it around it&amp;#39;s not secret letter thank you thank you for all you do",

called freedom sex here that death by my speech as like they already noticed yeah girl is stressed i saw a couple bugs crawling around and i&amp;#39;m really not ready to have pests on my houseplants but we don&amp;#39;t always get what we want do we which i guess is fitting for the subject of today&amp;#39;s video so i might have thrips but on the bright side the plant of the day is my african violet and you are seeing that correctly it is blooming yes i have shown this plant before but it did not have flowers coming out oh this is so exciting as a plant parent it&amp;#39;s my first plant that i&amp;#39;ve actually gotten to bloom yay so as i film this the most popular video on this youtube channel is related to disability perhaps that&amp;#39;s because the title is juicy or perhaps it&amp;#39;s because watching a fairly attractive and capable and driven young woman talk about her disability is interesting i don&amp;#39;t know i guess we&amp;#39;ll see how other videos on this topic do and we&amp;#39;ll find out and it&amp;#39;s not gonna go i only put those flattering qualifiers by myself because they are such an intense stigma around people with disabilities the broadest these ugly and sad and pitiful creatures miserable lonely and depressed pathetic poor unfortunate souls miss me with your pity but i will take some real social change more ramps and automatic open doors would be great that&amp;#39;s another topic there&amp;#39;s so many fun and shocking and vulnerable videos i want to make about my disability i want to show you how i do workouts with my trainer i want to tell you about pretending i was drunk all the time in college rather than just talking about my disability i don&amp;#39;t know why i thought that would be less embarrassing and the freaking psychological trauma of intense self-consciousness every time i went out in public for years i want to tell you why i&amp;#39;m motivated and why i choose joy in spite of the circumstances but this is supposed to be an introduction a reference point for people down the road when i have a lot of videos on this topic people can come back to this and say what even is this girl&amp;#39;s disability so what i have is called free drinks ataxia it&amp;#39;s a genetic neuromuscular progressive condition and let&amp;#39;s unpack that and before we get started i wonder out there that in college i was one of those soft and fluffy liberal arts majors my specialty was english science has always been my worst subject if i ever started to get arrogant and think i was really smart just up in the upper echelons of intelligence taking science labs in college humbled me so i&amp;#39;ve been trying to explain my disability but it&amp;#39;ll probably be lacking to say the least genetic a lot of this video is gonna rely on you remembering random stuff from biology in high school so let&amp;#39;s hope you have a good memory do you remember those little equations we did where with two parents who carry a disease they would be represented by a big r and a little r the big r is the dominant trait the little r is the recessive trait so when those two people have kids the three possibilities are one their kid has the two big cars meaning they don&amp;#39;t have the disease and they don&amp;#39;t carry it possibility too they end up with a big r and a little r which means they don&amp;#39;t have the disease but they carry it possibility three they have two little r&amp;#39;s which means they have the disease and of course they also carry it the reason we are here today is because i ended up with two little r&amp;#39;s my brother doesn&amp;#39;t have f a so either he got two big r&amp;#39;s or a big r and a little r we won&amp;#39;t know if we don&amp;#39;t have a genetic test and you know healthcare of the us so not gonna happen although only one in 50 000 people have ffa and of course i had to be one of those freaking 50 000 a whopping 1 in 200 people carry it people who carry this disease are always mating and having children but because the disease doesn&amp;#39;t manifest they don&amp;#39;t even know that they carry it in their family even when those two people have kids 75 chance their kid will not have the disease realistically we all probably carry a ton of recessive traits for different conditions and diseases and disabilities but we&amp;#39;ll just never know it neuromuscular so our neurons travel from our brain to our muscles to tell them what to do and my dear odds struggle with that you had one job so almost everything i do is affected walking of course anything that involves hand eye coordination eyesight hearing speech even swallowing which gives me a valid reason to hate shots at the time of making this video i use a wheelchair mostly but i do vlog a little bit in the gym with my trainer because i need a lot of help and it&amp;#39;s so exhausting and everything else i named i&amp;#39;m impaired on all those things but i could definitely but i could definitely but i could definitely be worse off the other predominant symptoms with fa are fatigue and heart problems no i don&amp;#39;t know why atheros have heart problems i told you i was bad at science but most of us do have cardiomyopathy to some extent the other big one is fatigue so let&amp;#39;s unravel this real quick when you have fa it means that in your dna code there is a certain gene that repeats a bunch and it&amp;#39;s not supposed to now bear in mind that dna is like the instruction manual for your body cells it tells them what to do and how to do it so if your dna is screwed you&amp;#39;re screwed now do you also remember from biology that good old saying that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell well my faulty dna code is sending out the wrong signals to the mitochondria of my body cells which means that they can&amp;#39;t make the energy that they&amp;#39;re supposed to imagine an elephant on a train the train is our mitochondria but the elephant is our gene repeats so here&amp;#39;s the explain like i&amp;#39;m five versions we have a perfectly good perfectly capable train and this big guy is screwing everything up uh how freaking rude progressive my disability gets worse with time let&amp;#39;s skip another half science lesson and just take that at face value okay for the last 10 to 15 years i&amp;#39;ve transitioned from walking but exhibiting symptoms to using a walker to using a wheelchair and lots of things big and small have gotten harder sadly and here i am acting all natural lots about it and making jokes throughout the video you learn to cope it&amp;#39;s like that bible verse laughter is the best medicine but a broken spirit dries the bones and honestly who needs dry bones on top of all the other drunk i just described so that&amp;#39;s my disability in a nutshell visit carefa.org to learn more or to donate because we be trying to cure this ish now that i&amp;#39;ve laid the groundwork and explained my disability to you guys i&amp;#39;m excited to get the chipping away at these ideas i have so please like share and comment on this video please subscribe to my channel thank you so much for dropping by and god bless you all [Music] [Music]",

If you joined us the   previous year you probably know that since 2020, \nFARA has been organizing this series of webinars   called the FARA Flash Talks during the month of \nMay. The month of May is FA Awareness Month, and   this year, May 20th is FA Awareness day, and we \nwould like to celebrate this month by bringing you   every Thursday in May some exciting new \nresearch in FA and we have asked Junior   investigators that are working on FA all over \nthe world to share their research with us.   We added a little bit of a challenge to them \nbecause we are asking them to present their   research in just five minutes and one slide and to \nexplain it in very simple terms, in very lay terms   so I encourage you to take this opportunity to \nask them questions and to learn about FA and   about them. We will take questions after each talk \nand you can type your questions in the Q&amp;amp;A box. At the end of the webinar, keep your browser open \nto vote for the best presentation like we did the   previous years. We&amp;#39;ll recognize the most voted \npresentations with an award. The webinars are   recorded and you can watch them later on YouTube \nso don&amp;#39;t worry if you cannot attend all of them.   We have two moderators with me today, Tricia \nand Mike, who will take over in a minute,   and we&amp;#39;ll introduce the speakers and take your \nquestions. Before we get started I&amp;#39;d also like   to mention that FARA is joining fara Australia \nin the Lend Us Some Muscle Global Challenge.   Lend Us Some Muscle is an initiative that \nencourages everyone to be active during   the month of May and help raise awareness for FA. \nYou can request free tattoos. We put the the web   address there on the slide, and Jamie will put \nit in the chat as well. And you can you know,   put a tattoo on your arm or wherever and share a \npicture of your tattooed muscle on social media. This is the agenda for today. And today \nwe&amp;#39;re gonna learn about the biology of FA,   some of the biology of FA and this session \ncovers some new hypotheses of mechanism that can   contribute to the dysfunction both of the cellular \nand the tissue level in FA. As you know we first   need to understand the disease to figure out \nways to treat it. We need to know everything that   goes wrong in FA, all the changes that having low \nfrataxin causes, to be able to develop treatments   and address all the symptoms of FA. So you will \nhear about some toxic protein produced in the   FA cells, about some changes in the metabolism \nor a special type of fat that makes up the cell   membrane, a presence of leaks in the barrier that \nprotects the brain, and how to use a new mouse   model to understand the heart pathology in FA. And \nwith that I will turn it over to our moderators   Tricia and Mike. I&amp;#39;m not sure... I don&amp;#39;t remember \nwho&amp;#39;s going first, but they&amp;#39;ll take it from here. Thank you, Liz. My name is Tricia. I am an \nFA patient. I live with my husband and three   children, and I&amp;#39;m a proud member \nof the current ambassador group.   Our first speaker for the day will be \nLisa Romano of the University of Florida,   and she will be telling us &amp;quot;Does the GAA repeat \nexpansion produce proteins that can damage cells?&amp;quot; Hey, thank you so much, Tricia, for the \nintroduction I&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and share   my screen. Okay. Alright, so hello everyone! My \nname is Liza Romano. I&amp;#39;m a post-doctorate in the   Ranum lab here in the Center for Neurogenetic \nat University of Florida, and today I am going   to talk about, of course, FA, but for from a \ncompletely different perspective. So, get ready.   So, I want to start by introducing some \nbackground that everybody knows well.   Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is caused by a repeat \nexpansion mutation in the frataxin gene.   In particular, in the internal one uh this GAA \nTTC expansion mutation is repeated several times   and cause fataxin loss so what uh some of you \nmay don&amp;#39;t know is that when you have a repeat   expansion this there is a in a gene there \nis a particular process that can happen this   process is called run translation so now I&amp;#39;m \ngonna try to explain you what this process is   so in our lab we discovered that when you \nhave a repeat expansion in a gene this   repeat expansion can produce uh two different \nrnas uh one in the sensor Direction and one in   the antescence direction and from these rnas \nuh several protein can be produced up to six   um three protein in the sense Direction and other \nthree protein in the antisense direction so when   you think about the repeat expansion itself in \nthe gene you need also to think about the RNA   that will be composed by the same type of repeat \nand that is really true also for the protein so   those proteins that we are gonna call the Run \nprotein from now on are composed by a repetition   of the same amino acid sequence all over again \nso when I start to my boss Docker here at uh I deeply and intensively study other repeat \nexpansion disorders such as C9 or 72 Sky 8   which is another Ataxia and mitonic District type \n2 and what I learned is that those run protein   have the tendency to aggregate in the cells \nand in human tissue they are A protein that are   extremely toxic for neuron in particular and run \ntranslation and RAM protein can be produced when   cells are under stress so those are the potential \nrun protein that can be produced from the GAA and   TTC repeat expansion in the fat oxygen we have \npolyglutamic acid polylizing polyarginine in the   sense Direction and polyphenylalanine polystyrene \nand Polynesian so my question when I started this   project was very very easy thus run translation \nhappen in a thing since fa is a repeat expansion   disorder and to answer that question I use \nuh two different antibody that can Target   polystyrene which is this type of Aggregates \nhere and polyleucin which are possibly the   two anti-sense around protein and fail so I use \nthis antibody to test some human autopsy tissue   and with the a great surprise we found that uh in \ncerebellum uh human tissue we can see accumulation   of polystyrene and the polyleucin in the dentite \nnuclei and in the also in the molecular layer   of the cerebellum and granular cell layer so \nthose Aggregates those red huge Aggregates are   present throughout the cerebellum and that&amp;#39;s \ntrue for polystyrene and also for polyleucin   so what is important is that um those protein \nare present is true in the fa patients but they   are not in FA carriers so that that throw us \nin a completely new world and we are trying   to understand if the mitochondrial defect that \nwe see that is caused by photaxine loss can be   a trigger for run translation to happen so in the \nnext couple of years or hopefully more I will be   um trying to untangle this around translation uh \nin FA I want to understand this the mitochondrial   defect can trigger and translation I want \nto deeply study those uh run protein in   particular therefore missing and to do that \nI&amp;#39;m planning to develop some new antibody to   study them Vector I want to see if those run \nprotein in FA are toxic especially for neuron   and cardiomyocytes but most importantly \nI want to see if the therapeutic approach   that we have in place for other repeat \nexpansion disorders such as C9 or 72 or approach that we can possibly use to treat fa so \nwith that I conclude my talk and I want to thank   of course Safara to give me the opportunity \nto carry on this fantastic project that I&amp;#39;m   very passionate about and also of course my mentor \nLaura Numa which is very very supportive of me and   is a fantastic project and of course I thank \nyou all and I&amp;#39;m happy to take any questions we have one question so if anybody else has \nquestions please throw it in the Q and A section   the one question for you is when you refer to \nstress what kind of stress are you talking about   okay so what we know especially from uh well \nI study uh really really uh intensively C9   uh I&amp;#39;m talking about uh ER stress uh which is \nuh one of the stress that can cause a protein   accumulation but also I well I have some \nevidence of mitochondrial stress that can be   involved in a random protein accumulation \nbecause by treating with H2O2 which is   um stress or I can see an increase of ram \nprotein in a C9 or 72 in that context but   generally potentially every type of stress can \nbe a trigger for Ram translation to happen really   so we are studying um deeply those things there is one word question do I \nhave timeless yeah yeah sure okay okay um the next question is \nhow long did this Study last sorry is uh can you repeat the \nquestion how long did the study last   uh this study I I did start working on on \nfa in Augusta so is a really new brand new   project uh that I&amp;#39;m planning to to work \non uh in the next few years and hopefully   um if I will continue in the \nacademic World maybe for longer   there are q a I don&amp;#39;t know if you see them \nTrisha but one is about studying uh polyphenol   phenomenon polyphy yeah you study polystyrene \nand polyleucin well yeah we study polycedine   and polyleucin because we produce the antibody for \nother uh ataxias and those other Ataxia accumulate   policy in a policy and this is why we have so many \ninformation about these two run protein that are   very toxic uh so I&amp;#39;m right now developing a new \nantibody to Target every single one of them and   to study them better and I have to say that the \npolyphenylalanina is the most well to produce the   antibody for it is very difficult so what I am \ndoing is to try to study that in an uh you know   over expression and in vitro kind of model right \nnow because I don&amp;#39;t have uh yet antibody available   but I predict and maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong that this is \ngoing to be a very nasty protein to to work with you see the the other two there&amp;#39;s another \none about how if longer repeats uh lead to   a lot larger amount of Iran translation \nuh well they&amp;#39;re longer the repeat the   longer uh the uh the amino acid sequence \nwill be so potentially you have a bigger   Aggregates for example uh but yeah we we see \nsome correlation with the repeat length but   I cannot really speculate that on on fa \nbecause it&amp;#39;s like a work in progress and   just started is definitely something that I \nwill look into and try to see if there is a   correlation between the repeat length and the \nyou know how toxic how bad those proteins are and there&amp;#39;s one last one yep have you \ndefinitely concluded that round proteins   have not accumulated in carrier tissue okay \nso uh that&amp;#39;s a very great question so right   now I&amp;#39;m uh I did the screen uh six fa \npatients and two uh career which are   um they don&amp;#39;t have any policy in and poly losing \nAggregates um I definitely have to to look into   all the other Ram protein really and we are trying \nto collect some more sample for the fa carrier in   order for me to add more into the um cohort \nthat I already analyzed but by now the career   that I analyze they are not accumulating any \nof the polynucine and polythene um run protein and I did conclude that by by IHC \nand uh using these two antibodies and there is another question Lisa for the GAA \nrepeats heavy study interruptions of the repeats   and the effect on the protein that&amp;#39;s a fantastic \nquestion and this is something that I will   definitely dig into it uh because you know we we \nknow from other diseases that Interruption can uh   you know modulate this type of protein so we would \nlike to to see if Interruption make things worse   um yeah it&amp;#39;s definitely something \nthat we&amp;#39;re gonna look into it but we   didn&amp;#39;t yet yeah it&amp;#39;s a project that just \nstarted last August so you need to wait I don&amp;#39;t see any other questions at \nthis time so thank you very much   for this presentation if anybody does have \nany further questions you can drop them in   the Q a and we will come back to them thank \nyou I&amp;#39;ll stop for sharing my skin thank you   at this time I would like to introduce Mike \nAnderson who will introduce the next presentation   hi all uh I&amp;#39;m a parent of two sons with fa and \na retired neuroscientist so for whatever that&amp;#39;s   worth um all right our next talk is by zanushka \nRam tutor from uh Brunei University in London   so very far away uh welcome and she&amp;#39;s going to \nspeak on the role of sphingolipids in FA so so for   those of you don&amp;#39;t know much about sphingo lipids \nthere in essence fat molecules of a certain type   thank you thank you very much Mark for \nthe for the introduction I&amp;#39;ll just share   my share my screen uh like Mike said I&amp;#39;m \nzenishka I&amp;#39;m a second year PhD student   at Brunel University London in the United \nKingdom and today I&amp;#39;m going to be talking   to you about the research that I&amp;#39;m working \non for my PhD project which is the role as   finger lipids or certain kind of fat in FA \nand if we can Target this for the disease   so I&amp;#39;ll start off by explaining a little \nbit what happens in fa so as you heard   um from the last speaker uh Frederick&amp;#39;s attacks \nhere is characterized by a ga repeat expansion in   the fxn Gene and what happens is when we have this \nmutation we have a reduction in the level of the   protein protection when we have reduced levels \nof the protein protection this has an impact   on the mitochondria if without this protection \nprotein the mitochondria cannot have the activity   that it needs to have and it also leads to iron \ntoxicity leading to increases in oxidative stress   and eventually cell death this leads to symptoms \nsuch as difficulties in Walking cardiomyopathy   and skeletal deformities sometimes patients can \nbecome wheelchair-bound and have a shortened   lifespan so it&amp;#39;s really important for us to look \nat all the different Avenues in FA and see how we   can treat it so what I&amp;#39;m doing is looking at the \nrole of swinger lipids or fats which have been   investigated in other neurodegenerative disorders \nsuch as Alzheimer&amp;#39;s and in Parkinson&amp;#39;s and seeing   if this can have an effect in fa so what are \nfinger lipids so sphingolipids are a kind of fat   that you can find in your cell membrane and these \nare involved in controlling the levels of cell   growth and the levels of cell death so what we \nhave is a Cascade of reactions which leads to the   formation of a fat called ceramide ceramide can \nthen be converted by these things called enzymes   into different fats which can control cell growth \nor cell death so ceramide and sphingosine are   fats which control cell death whilst sphingosine \none phosphate and ceramide one phosphate or s1p   and c1p for short are involved in promoting cell \ngrowth so what I&amp;#39;m doing for my project is looking   at targeting the different enzymes involved in \nforming these fats and seeing if they have any   improvements in fa so in the Ataxia research lab \nat Brunel University London we have two different   kinds of models the first are in vitro cell lines \nderived from patients of fa and the other is an fa   Mouse model we have ygha and yg8 extra large \nwhich have over 800 GAA repeats so the first   thing to look at was to see if there were in \nfact any differences in the levels of these   fats and what we found is that there&amp;#39;s a reduced \nlevel of s1p which is involved in promoting cell   growth and an increased level in ceramide which \nis involved in promoting cell death so then what   I did was have a look at which enzymes actually \ncontrol the levels of ceramide and s1p so that   I can then investigate these so sphk is involved \nin promoting s1p and lpp is involved in promoting   ceramide levels so the next step was to look \nand see are there any changes in this and so   what I did is I looked at the gene expression and \nprotein expression by shown gene expression here   but they showed the same Trend in that there is \na reduced level of sphk at an increased level of   lpp I also then confirmed what I found in the \ncell lines in the fa Mouse models and found an   increase in lpp protein expression and a decrease \nin sphk protein expression so following on from   this The Next Step was to Target this to see if \nwe can increase the activity of sphk and decrease   the activity of lpp and see what effect this had \nso by activating sphk and improving its activity   I&amp;#39;ve actually found that there are increases \nin FX and gene expression following this   furthermore after reducing the gene expression \nlevel lpp I found an increase in the sphk level   at the gene expression level as well as increases \nin effects and gene expression so now that I&amp;#39;ve   found a difference in the levels of these finger \nlipids and that in fact targeting these enzymes   had an effect on fxn it was important to look and \nsee are there any changes in the mitochondrial   dysfunction that we have in FA and so looking at \nthe mitochondrial reactive oxygen species as well   as the activity through mitochondrial membrane \npotential I found that by targeting these enzymes   we can reduce the levels of this reactive oxygen \nspecies in the mitochondria as well as improve   the mitochondrial membrane potential so I.E \ngiving some sort of indicator of mitochondrial   activity in FA cell lines as well so having \nseen these improvements I have prophesied that   these targets could potentially have an effect on \nother mitochondrial dysregulation found in FA and   potentially could have an effect on for tax and \nprotein expression and this is really important   for going forward because it outlines a different \nmechanism by which fa could be happening inside   the body I would like to take this moment to say \nthank you to Farah for giving me the opportunity   to give this talk as well as everybody in \nthe Ataxia research lab at Brunel for all of   their support and thank you to you as well for \nlistening and I&amp;#39;m happy to take any questions thank you for uh a very nice \npresentation uh way over my head uh   I guess one question I have is is are \nthese sphingolipids uh affected by um   reactive oxygen species that we know are a part \nof the the sequelae that fa patients go through   yes so it has been shown in not in fibroblasts or \nan fa in particular but in other cell types that   reactive oxygen species can trigger the levels of \nceramide and vice versa so it&amp;#39;s not quite clear   which of these happens first if reactive oxygen \nspecies it&amp;#39;s sugaring ceramide or ceramide is   triggering reactive oxygen species but we know \nthat there is some interaction between them are these sphingolipids sort of uniformly \npresent in brain and heart and you know   throughout after all every living cell has \na membrane so is there any differential   so the ones I&amp;#39;m looking at specifically they are \nvery much abundant in the mitochondria so you are   going to find them in those cell types in those \ntissues like you mentioned like the brain the   cerebellum the heart those um tissues which very \nmuch rely on the mitochondria you do find those   in there they can also be localized to other parts \nof the cells such as the endoplasmic reticulum and   the Golgi apparatus as well but it is more or \nless uniform in those sort of places where you   get the mitochondria so we have a question from \nthe audience uh you show a decreased expression   level of stingosine and an increase in ceramide \nhowever the decrease in the increase are within   the error bars therefore my question you is \ndo you feel that expression change is real   which is always a question and researcher or \nanything yeah so some of the disparities that   we find when we do our experiments can come down \nto the level of the ga repeat expansion so because   of the cell lines that we have some of the cell \nlines have maybe 300 GA repeats all the cell   lines have 700 to 800 GA repeats and it has been \nshown in literature that the greater the length   of the ga repeat the greater the impact this is on \ntranscription and the reduced levels of potassium   and further down Downstream effects of the of \nthe disease so a lot of these um um issues that   we have in terms of variability comes from that GA \nrepeat expansion but the general trend is the same do you have access to other other cell \ntypes from from the patient population   uh cheek cells or you know something Beyond \nfibroblasts so the reason that we use fibroblasts   are typically because they are easier to grow in \nin the lab they grow quite well and also a lot   of research done within when within fa uses \nfibroblast because they&amp;#39;ve been established   they you can buy them quite easily from The \ncorial Institute and obtain them so that&amp;#39;s   one of the reasons why we use the fibroblast \ncell lines currently we don&amp;#39;t have any other   cell types but this is one of the reasons why \nwe use the fa Mouse models and take tissues   from them to see if there are any changes in \nthose tissues and that are highly affected   in FA but it&amp;#39;s a good point and it would be \ngood to look at some other cell types as well I have um like a general question of do you \nthink this changes that you see can is are a   good way to measure how this disease progresses \nover time our do you see changes for example in   the mouse you know do they get worse yeah I \nthink it I think it&amp;#39;s a good way one of the   aims that I have when I reach the final year \nof my PhD so in around October November time   of this year is to have a look with these Mouse \nmodels and do things like rotoro tests hang wire   test grip strength test and see if there are \nany effects over time with the mouse models   as well as doing some dose studies as well with \nthese with these drugs and seeing if there is   any effect on the ability to walk the the grip \nstrength and afterwards taking those tissues and   again evaluating the gene expression and protein \nexpression and seeing if there&amp;#39;s any change there you&amp;#39;ve obviously given a lot of thought to \nthis aspect which is a fairly new aspect for   fa research do you have any ideas about \nhow this could be therapeutically useful um we I are any improvements in the ability of walking \nor in the strength of these mice if these drugs   could then be further put into clinical trials \nlet&amp;#39;s say after animal studies there could be   a therapeutic effect there particularly looking \nat the fact that there has been some improvements   in gene expression level if there is shown to \nbe an improvement at the protein expression   level as well this could potentially could have an \neffect in the mitochondria in reducing that iron   toxicity and that oxidative stress rather than \njust targeting the antioxidant effect which is   what some treatments in clinical trials are doing \nnow and how our motherlocked alone works as well are there any other questions from the audience \nso there is one in the Q a so the question is how   many individuals take part of the study but so \nmaybe you know um we can ask or is the the 500   fiber plus from one uh individual for multiple \nindividuals and do they you know do you see them   in all of them in all the different lines if they \nare you have multiple lines yeah so these are uh   different patients so each repeat that I do is \nwith a different patient cell line so I will have   at least three different uh healthy individual \ncell lines and at least three Fida um fa uh   individual cell lines as as well I can&amp;#39;t remember \nwhat the other part of the question was sorry   but that was that was it yeah if you have \nmultiple lines that your fibroblast line   comes from multiple delivers yeah \nyeah they&amp;#39;re multiple patients so   in the Ataxia research lab we have around \neight different ones about eight healthy   ones eight fa ones and we try to use \nas many as possible in in the studies our next person is Francis Smith out of the state   um University of New York at Buffalo and the total \nof her presentation is is your brain zipper down thank you Trisha for the \nintroduction let me get started here okay so thank you so much Trisha for the \nintroduction and for the opportunity to   speak today um my name is Francis Smith and \nI work in the Daniel J&amp;#39;s Osman lab and we are   at the University in Buffalo in New York and \nthis is us over here in the lab uh you might   not know us very well yet we are pretty new to \nthe faqc we&amp;#39;ve only started researching and at   Bay in the past couple of years but we have \nfound that it&amp;#39;s a very excellent Community to   be a part of we&amp;#39;re happy to be here everything \nthat I&amp;#39;m going to talk about today has been in   the development of my PhD degree here at Buffalo \nand I&amp;#39;m going to be asking you for the fa brain   is your brain zipper down and hopefully by the \nend of the talk you&amp;#39;ll know what I mean by that so instead of what we would normally think of \nin an fa talk talking about the brain I&amp;#39;m not   going to be talking about the whole brain but \ninstead I&amp;#39;m going to be talking about the blood   vessels which sit right on top of the brain \nand this is often also called The Blood brain   and if we zoom in it&amp;#39;ll molecularly what this \nlooks like the blood-brain barrier is exactly   what it sounds like it&amp;#39;s a layer of cells that \nphysically separate the blood from the brain   and it has a very important job so the blood \nbrain barrier has to provide nutrients that   travel through the blood such as oxygen and sugars \nso that the brain cells can get these nutrients   but it also has to make sure that there aren&amp;#39;t any \ntoxins or any germs coming from the blood into the   brain and the reason that the blood-brain barrier \nis so good at this is because of two architectures   cellular architectures I&amp;#39;m going to talk about \nso the first one we can think of like they are   the teeth of a zipper so these are proteins \nwhich sit at the edge of neighboring cells in   this blood vessel here and they make it so that \nthey the neighboring cells can be zipped up tight   the second structure that&amp;#39;s important to this \nis proteins that sit underneath the zipper   and they&amp;#39;re kind of like Lego bricks so a single \nLego brick doesn&amp;#39;t offer very much structure but   when the Lego bricks are attached up in a nice \nwall they can really give a strong structure   and so both of these two different cell \narchitectures the zipper teeth proteins   and the Lego block wall are important in making \nso that the blood-brain barrier can do its job   of making sure that the right molecules enter \nthe brain and no bad molecules under the brain   and so for a little bit of background information \nit&amp;#39;s been found in Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease patients   that bad zipping between these cells can cause \ndamage to the brain cells that sit underneath   these blood vessels and the reason that we need \nto protect these brain cells also called neurons   is because these cells are very very sensitive \nto any kind of damage and so the hypothesis for   my factual thesis has been that bad zipping might \nbe causing a toxic brain environment in FA as well   I&amp;#39;m going to talk about three results that I&amp;#39;ve \nfound so far the first is that in my essay models   of these uh blood-brain barrier cells we lose some \nof the zipper teeth between the individual cells   and if you&amp;#39;ve ever had a jacket with a broken \nzipper you know that then the zipper isn&amp;#39;t very   functional secondly I&amp;#39;ve found that my Lego brick \nwall is disrupted and not only is it disrupted   but there are some proteins that prevent \nthose Lego bricks from lining up very well   and finally I&amp;#39;ve found that these changes come \nalong with the ability for molecules small   molecules to move between these cells and remember \nwe don&amp;#39;t want that to happen because the cells   that we&amp;#39;re supposed to be protecting are the brain \nneurons and they&amp;#39;re very vulnerable distressed   so in total what I found is that we have \nchanges and those two architectural parts   of the cell that I talked about we have less \nthat repeat protein and we can&amp;#39;t form a nice   structured brick wall beneath us and so what \ndoes this mean for the future of essay research   there are some medicines that can help the \ncells make more zipper tea proteins and so   what I&amp;#39;ll be answering in the next part of \nmy research and further on in my career is   it these medicines by improving the zipper teeth \ncan help the environment of the fa patient brain   so finally I would like to thank the American \nHeart Association for supporting my projects   for the final two years of my PhD program for \npharah for the invitation to see today and   for all of the listeners so I thank you \nall and I&amp;#39;m happy to take any questions there is a question what are the zipper tooth \nproteins and the Lego block proteins called   the zipper teeth proteins there are two zipper \nteeth proteins um uh one of them is called   Claudine and the second one is called occluden and \nthey are actually stuck to the Lego proteins by a   third protein called zo1 or zo2 and the Lego \nblock proteins are called actin so um these   are part of what we call the cytoskeleton it&amp;#39;s \nexactly what it sounds like it is a structural   skeleton that sits in the cells to make sure that \nthe cell has the right kind of structures foreign any work to find what molecules might support \nthe barrier and keep it more structurally sound   that&amp;#39;s uh what I&amp;#39;m moving on into right \nnow when I&amp;#39;m looking at some of these   medicines to see if we can help support \nthe structure of the zipper teeth proteins   um there are some therapies to help support \nthe structure of the Lego brick proteins but   it gets a little bit complicated because uh \nkind of charging this pathway might end up   changing some other parts of the cell in terms \nof what we call the redox potential so if there   are any oxidative stressors it starts to get \na little bit complicated when we try to change   um The Lego brick wall problem but the zipper \nteeth problem um hopefully can be an 86. okay Liz would you like to interpret the next question \nsure I think it is asking if maybe the if there&amp;#39;s   a really this um this leak in the blood Mania \nwouldn&amp;#39;t that cause a bigger effect in FA   um it depends uh there are a couple different \nkinds of leaks um what we know of as a stroke   is a big leap in the blood vessel um but there are \nblood vessels of all different sizes in the brain   so we can see up in my picture as well there are \nsome really thick big blood vessels and they they   can be smaller um so the smaller blood vessels \nwould be for instance micro capillaries and if we   have a small leak in those micro capillaries it&amp;#39;s \nvery hard to detect um so it can be a spectrum I&amp;#39;m more curious about how how did you \nget to this idea why did you you know   um did you have any indication on any um that \nthat this was an issue in FA or how did you get   to the idea to study the blood barrier that&amp;#39;s a \ngood question it was a lot of friends speculation   um we actually are a blood-brained barrier \nlab we are not a free work to taxi a lab so   we didn&amp;#39;t have any access to Patient MRIs um or \nany kind of patient brain samples to look at you   know the possibility for any weeks but what&amp;#39;s \nalways been striking to me is the presence of   brain iron accumulation and disease um which \nthere&amp;#39;s a little bit of literature showing   that the brain iron accumulation happens \nthroughout the entirety of disease versus   the uh the times of disease where the brain \ncells are dying that&amp;#39;s really early so I was   kind of interested to know why this brain iron \naccumulation is happening continually and could   it be coming from if there are any leaks in the \nblood-brain barrier because of course iron is   very present in the blood so if we get any kind \nof micro bleeds like I talked about that might   be a reason that we&amp;#39;re seeing that brain energy \nsituation and that led to this whole hypothesis is there any evidence that that these defects \nare in one part of the brain and not another   reason these are endothelial cells \nby and large I assume yeah yeah   the other ramification of course is that \none of the difficulties with drug therapy   in the nervous system for fa patients is that \na lot of the drugs don&amp;#39;t pass the blood-brain   barrier so you know find finding this out and \nwhether it is differentially an issue could be uh   of great impact on drug access and so on \nyes I agree um from what I know about other S as um blood-brain barrier breakdown um whether \nthat is regional you know specific to one area of   the brain or not um I&amp;#39;m unsure that is something \nthat I would like to understand because as we know   the fa brain itself is affected differentially in \ndisease you know the cerebellum is really affected   versus parts of cerebrum are less packed so that \nis certainly you know an interesting route to   take and like we&amp;#39;ve said earlier um until we have \ntherapies and cures I think that the best way to   approach these pathologies of fa is to not leave \nany stone unturned you know and really try to look   at all of the pathologies that we can to \ntry to find some therapeutic Essentials well thank you Francis I think we probably should \nmove on to the to the final contribution in this   hour and it&amp;#39;s coming to us from uh Tyler perfect \nand he&amp;#39;s from Pfizer and it&amp;#39;s going to be quite a   shift from what we have been talking about because \nnow he&amp;#39;s going to talk about uh cardiac potential   problems and the use of mouse models in particular \nin heart failure in an fa model um Tyler   all right thank you Mike for the \nintroduction go ahead and pull up my slide all right so as Mike mentioned this is \nless of a research project and more a   new tool that we hope that other researchers \nin the fa Community will be able to utilize   so us as well as plenty other of research utilize \nmouth models in order to study disease uh in a   living animal as well as to potentially test \nTherapeutics on there are a number of different   Mouse models for fa many replicate the entire \ndisease as it occurs in human patients but   there are also specific models that only affect \ndifferent parts of the body for fa there are   a number of different models that only remove \nfor toxin from the heart of mice while keeping   it present in the rest of the body this still \ngenerates a lot of symptoms such as heart failure   in these mice models which allow for researchers \nto really focus in on key symptoms of FAA   now in the field there is a commonly used Mouse \nmodel called the mck for tax and mouse model that   I&amp;#39;ve got pictured here in red on the slide \nthis is widely used but we&amp;#39;ve generated what   we&amp;#39;re calling the new mck for tax and model \nthat&amp;#39;s going to be pictured here in blue   and we generated this model because we hope to \novercome some of the disadvantages of the old   nck model which the main disadvantage is that this \nmouse model is a very severe form of the disease   so here on the right I have a graph that \nis actually echocardiographic data which   is an important indication that&amp;#39;s used \nin human patients but I&amp;#39;ve relabeled   it to hopefully make the point that your heart \nhealth can be very good or it can be very bad in   um unaffected individuals as well as fa patients \nnow here in red you can see the old mck for tax   and model begins to show symptoms as early as \nfive to six weeks old which is very young for mice   this progresses over the next couple of weeks \nwith an increased heart size cardiac hypertrophy   which eventually does lead to heart failure and \nthese animals are no longer able to survive after   around nine to ten weeks of age now while this \nis good in the sense that you can get studies   like finished quickly in that short amount of \ntime it does pose a problem in that you have   a very short window in order to look at the \ndisease as well as test potential therapies   especially if you&amp;#39;re trying to prevent the therap \nthe disease from even occurring in the first place   with our do mouse model the new mck we&amp;#39;ve \ngot that pictured here in blue you can   see that up until nine weeks of age which is \nwhen the old model would begin to pass away   our model as far as we can tell is basically \nindistinguishable from uh unaffected Mouse even   though it doesn&amp;#39;t have any for tax and expression \nin the heart instead what we get is starting at   around 13 weeks of age and going to around 18 \n19 weeks of age in these animals we begin to see   um symptoms pop up but they occur uh in a much \nslower fashion and they still do eventually   reach the same severity that we see with the old \nmck mouse model but it takes a lot longer and it   occurs much slower which is uh useful for a mouse \nmodel it allows these animals to live longer into   adulthood it allows researchers more time to test \ntherapies and to see if they can reverse these   changes that aren&amp;#39;t occurring so dramatically and \nso our hope is that you know this new model will   be able to put out into the fa field and that it \nwill be able to help researchers who are looking   at uh correcting the heart symptoms that occur \nin FA in order to hopefully find new Therapies   and with that I&amp;#39;d like to you know thank \neveryone here at Pfizer who&amp;#39;s been a part of   this project everyone at Farah for the opportunity \nto speak and uh to the audience for listening in all right we have a question and it is was cardiac \nfunction assessed between the old and the new   mck mice was there any echocardiogram studies to \nlook at hypertrophy or cardiomyopathy progression   yes so we&amp;#39;ve been able to perform both of those \nstudies not simultaneously but we&amp;#39;ve been able to   um perform them separately on the old and the new \nmice and as I mentioned before the progression   is a little bit slower in the newer mice but they \nstill do reach the same level of severity in terms   of uh echocardiographic output there&amp;#39;s a follow-up \nquestion or another question here what explains   the difference in the timing of the phenotype \nonset and decline do you have any insight in that   yeah so um you know I won&amp;#39;t dive too deep \ninto the genetics um but what we can say is   that our new mouse model initially does have um \na little bit more for Texan being expressed than   the old model not anything that would be above the \nexpression of a wild type animal or an unaffected   animal this model just seems to take longer to \nreally remove all the frataxin from the heart and we have another one uh first uh evaluation \nwhat great work are you finding a demand for your   new mouse cardiac Mouse model and I&amp;#39;m wondering \nhow interested the research Community is in   cardiac research specifically well so this is \nthe first public disclosure of this mouse model   actual actually so you know we are hoping that in \nthe future when this research is published that   the field will be able to have access to the \nmouse into incorporate it into their research   and there is a fair amount of interest in \nthe cardiac aspects of fa um heart failure   or any sort of arrhythmia you know is a is a \nvery uh devastating cause of mortality and Fa   patients and you know that&amp;#39;s the reason in and of \nitself for fa researchers to focus on the heart   um so this slower development is it uh is it \na dilation kind of uh beginning to failure in   other words do you see early on you know 14 weeks \nor so do you see that the the heart is gradually   dilating and thinning or you know what are the \nwhat does that look like in the mouse yeah so at the earlier time points um you know \nespecially at the nine week or so time   point the hearts are indistinguishable \nfrom and a wild type are unaffected   Mouse heart as this progresses we do start to \nsee a shift towards um hypertrophy we have um   increased heart size increased size of the \nleft ventricle um and we do also see um some changes in the dilation of the heart um not able to go too much into that at \nthis point don&amp;#39;t want to get you know   too stuck in the weeds but we do see \na little bit of dilated cardiomyopathy so I guess would you say that does this mouse \nmodel is going to give you insights into what   clinicians should be looking for in their patients \nbecause that&amp;#39;s always a difficult call in in many   patients where they&amp;#39;re compensating but and \ntheir heart is good is managing okay but the   question is who&amp;#39;s going to turn the corner \nto to really nasty potentially fatal failure   is there any insight there from from this new \nmodel yeah that&amp;#39;s a great question you know we   have only done you know kind of the initial \nwork on this model just looking at um the couple of time points that you see on here \na Next Step would definitely be going into some   more of those you know in between time points \nwhen we start to see a phenotype arise to see   if there&amp;#39;s anything specific that we might be \nable to pull out that could give an indication   to clinicians when when our animal goes from not \nhaving a phenotype to having a phenotype to see if   that could be translatable to patients so there&amp;#39;s \na question from the audience could cardiomyopathy   be detected in the early stages uh always be \nfound in Echo in other words is Echo sensitive   enough or is there another another uh technique \nthat would would actually give you better Insight   than simply Echo I realize that goes easier to \ndo but are there other things that you can try Ah that&amp;#39;s a great question um so for us in this initial characterization \nwe haven&amp;#39;t looked at anything   more sensitive than Echo we have been able \nto look at some of these time points at the   um the actual heart of the animals by weighing \nthem and getting the actual heart Mass relative to   unaffected animals and don&amp;#39;t see a \ngross change there but yeah doing a using some more Advanced Techniques we could \nmaybe see something at these earlier time points   um that&amp;#39;s something we haven&amp;#39;t done yet for anybody who&amp;#39;s not worked on a mouse mouse \ncardiac work because of the size of the chambers   and so forth even Echo is very challenging \nuh compared to humans and so forth so uh   here&amp;#39;s an here&amp;#39;s another question in the old \nmck for tax and research model researchers   were able to reverse the damage of the \nheart will the new uh the new model be   also be able to show this response \nif you&amp;#39;ve gotten into treatment yet   um so we haven&amp;#39;t done anything I haven&amp;#39;t \ndone anything in terms of treatment with   the new model but that is definitely you \nknow the next step that we&amp;#39;re looking to   um you know take this mouse model both you know \npotential treatments that have already been   published um whether that be gene therapy or you \nknow any sort of small molecule studies as well all right I don&amp;#39;t think we \nhave any other questions um yep I I would like to personally \nmake a statement I have I&amp;#39;ve I have   uh overseen presentations like this \nit&amp;#39;s extremely challenging to present   particularly to a lay audience but in such a short \nyou know 15-minute segment and all of you have   done a very nice job of of giving the essence of \nwhat you&amp;#39;re doing and obviously it&amp;#39;s only a small   piece of all the efforts that you&amp;#39;re uh you&amp;#39;re \nexpending so thanks thanks to all of you and   and your support and hope for continued

    "transcript": "[Dr. Ngo] The death of neurons,\ncardiomyocytes and pancreatic beta cells results in the\nclinical symptoms of the disease. The loss of neurons in\nthe brain leads to ataxia, defined as a lack of voluntary\nmuscle control and coordination. Patients experience muscle\nweakness, difficulty walking, and loss of sensation and\nreflexes. The loss of pancreatic beta cells leads to decreased\ninsulin production and the development of diabetes. And\nfinally, the loss of cardiomyocytes in the heart\nleads to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or the abnormal\nthickening of the heart, which can lead to heart failure.\nAnd this is the most common death for patients with\nFriedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. [Zheng] Hello there. Welcome back to\nanother episode of Rare Diseases! Rare Disease Review is\na not-for-profit medical journal organized by students from the\nUniversity of Toronto McMaster and Western University. This\npodcast is created by the branch of Western University. The\npodcast aims to advocate for rare disease awareness and\npromote students involvement in the rare disease community. We\nappreciate your listening and support today.

Never\ndisregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it\nbecause of something you have heard from this podcast. My name\nis Zheng Song, and you&amp;#39;re listening to the Rare Diseases podcast. For\nthis episode, we&amp;#39;re going to dive into a rare hereditary\ndisease called Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is the genetic\nprogressive neurodegenerative movement disorder. The typical\nage of onset is between 10 and 15 years. The initial symptoms\nof Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia includes unsteady posture, frequent\nfalling, and progressive difficulty in walking due to\nimpaired ability to coordinate voluntary movement, which is why\nit is called ataxia. The affected individual often\ndevelops slurred speech, called dysarthria, characteristic\nthrough deformities and an irregular curvature of the spine called\nscoliosis. Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is often associated with\ncardiomyopathy, a disease of cardiac muscle that may lead to\nheart failure or irregularities in heart rhythm called cardio-\narrhythmia. People with Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia have a higher chance to\nget diabetes. Friedreich&amp;#39;s Ataxia presents degenerative changes in\nsensory nerve fibers at the point where they enter the\nspinal cord in the structure known as dorsal root ganglia,\nwhich results in secondary degeneration of nerve fibers in the spinal\ncord, leading to a deficiency of sensory signals to the\ncerebellum, the part of the brain that helps to coordinate\nvoluntary movements. Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia, is caused by a\ntrinucleotide repeat expansion in the FXN gene, which codes for\na protein called frataxin. To better understand the scientific\nresearch on Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia, I spoke with Dr. Vy Ngo, a PhD\ngraduate from the Department of Pathology and Laboratory\nMedicine at Western university. Dr. Ngo focused her studies on\nthe cellular molecular mechanism of oxidative\nstress, which in Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is an important\ncontributing factor in the progression of the disease.\nWelcome, Dr. Ngo, it&amp;#39;s our honour to have you with us here\nto speak about Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia today. [Dr. Ngo] Thank you so\nmuch for having me. [Zheng] Yes, to start off, can we get to know a\nbit about your work? [Dr. Ngo] Well, I recently completed my PhD in\nPathology and Laboratory mMdicine at Western University.\nAnd my research focused on a protein called Nrf2,\nthe transcriptional master regulator of a cellular\noxidative stress response. So oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance\nbetween the production and accumulation of harmful free\nradicals in cells and tissues and the ability of a biological\nsystem to detoxify these free radicals. Oxidative stress is\nimplicated in a multitude of human diseases, including\nFriedreich&amp;#39;s Ataxia, where it plays a major role in the\nprogression of the disease. [Zheng] Well, that&amp;#39;s very fascinating. I\nwould really love to hear more about your research when you get a\nchance in the future. Now for today, could you give us a\nlittle bit of the insight into the cause of Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia?\n[Dr. Ngo] Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is caused by a mutation and the FXN gene on\nchromosome 9 that encodes for a protein called frataxin. It is\nan autosomal recessive disease, meaning an individual must\ninherit 2 abnormal copies of the FXN gene from both parents to\nexpress symptoms of Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. This inherited mutation\ncauses an abnormal repetition of three DNA nucleotides, GAA or\nguanine adenine adenine, known as a trinucleotide repeat\nexpansion. In normal individuals, this GAA sequence\nis repeated approximately 7 to 38 times FXN gene. However, in\nindividuals with Fredericks ataxia, there&amp;#39;s a sequence is\nrepeated anywhere from 66 to over 1700 times. This trial\nnucleotide repeat expansion causes gene silencing in the FXN\ngene, resulting in little or no production of this protoxin\nprotein. [Zheng] That&amp;#39;s really interesting. So frataxin protein\nis being affected in this disease for the patient to\ndevelop Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. What is the role of frataxin? [Dr. Ngo] Frataxin\nis involved in the incorporation of iron into iron-sulphur clusters, which\nserves as various enzyme cofactors including\nmitochondrial enzymes involved in electron transfer and\nultimately mitochondria ATP production. With insufficient\nfrataxin, two (2) key outcomes occur. Firstly, mitochondria are unable\nto incorporate iron into these iron-sulfur clusters, resulting\nin decreased mitochondrial ATP production and insufficient\nenergy for the cell. Secondly, these unused iron accumulates in\nthe cell and reacts with oxygen to form harmful free radicals,\nresulting in oxidative stress over time and ultimately oxidative damage\nif not remedied. This reduction in cellular ATP combined with\noxidative damage results in cell death, specifically in neurons\nand cells of the pancreas and heart, where frataxin is\nnormally most highly expressed. [Zheng] Thank you so much. So with these\nchanges as cellular level, what kind of symptoms and signs are\npatient might present? [Dr. Ngo] The death of neurons, cardiomyocytes, and\npancreatic beta cells results in the clinical symptoms of the\ndisease. The loss of neurons in the brain leads to ataxia,\ndefined as a lack of voluntary muscle control and coordination.\nPatients experience muscle weakness, difficulty walking,\nand loss of sensation and reflexes. The loss of pancreatic\nbeta cells leads to decreased insulin production and the\ndevelopment of diabetes. And finally, the loss of\ncardiomyocytes in the heart leads to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or the abnormal thickening of the\nheart, which can lead to heart failure. And this is the most\ncommon death for patients with Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. [Zheng] Wow this is very critical\nconditions. So how may a patient be diagnosed and treated?\n[Dr. Ngo] Currently, Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is diagnosed by genetic testing to\nidentify the trinucleotide repeat expansion and both copies\nof the FXN gene in addition to brain images scans, nerve\nconduction studies, blood tests and cardiac tests.\nUnfortunately, at the time there is no cure for Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia\nand currently no approved therapies for the treatment of\nthis disease. Treatment is focused on minimizing symptoms\nand maintaining comfort and muscle function. Options for\nthis include physical bracing of limbs, physiotherapy, speech\ntherapy, occupational therapy, corrective skeletal muscle\nsurgery, and medications to treat heart disease and\ndiabetes. And importantly, ongoing research has been\nconducted with hopes of a cure. [Zheng] So with all the wonderful\ninformation you presented here, could you tell us about the\nresearch side of Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia and how this is related\nto your research? [Dr. Ngo] As mentioned, Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is a result of\nthe increased production of the protein frataxin, which can\nimpair mitochondrial function and cause oxidative damage. This\noxidative stress induced damage and Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is of\nparticular interest to me, and so I&amp;#39;ll take a moment to discuss\nsome of the current work that is being done in this area. The\nfree radicals, such as those produced in Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia,\ncan damage cellular DNA, proteins and lipids,\nresulting in cell death. The cell contains various mechanisms\nto detoxify these free radicals and this is chiefly controlled by\nthe protein transcription factor Nrf2, which I mentioned before.\nNrf2 is responsible for activating the cellular\nantioxidant response. So essentially, Nrf2 means\nless oxidative stress. Small molecules that can activate Nrf2 \nmay have the potential to induce clinical\nbenefits in patients with Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. A 2019 study by Petrillo and\ncolleagues compared different error of two activators for the\ntreatment of Friedrichs ataxia. They found that sulforaphane and\nacetylcysteine were particularly effective on genes involved in\npreventing inflammation and maintaining homeostasis for the antioxidant glutathione and that dimethyl\nfumarate or vatiquinone (EPI-743) were effective in counteracting\ntoxic products accumulation. And finally, that they found\npositive effects of idebenone on mitochondrial protection. Other studies have found similar\nbenefits for Nrf2 activators in improving mitochondrial\nfunction, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, and\nultimately preventing cell death in the brain, heart, and\npancreas. [Zheng] Well, that&amp;#39;s incredibly\nfascinating. With these great progress in research, what do\nyou think is the direction of future research? [Dr. Ngo] Collectively, this suggests that\nthe development of synergistic therapies based on a combination\nof Nrf2 activators may have therapeutic benefits to patients\nwith Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. Such research is currently ongoing\nand in addition to reducing oxidative stress and improving\nmitochondrial function, other areas of Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia\ntreatment research include modulation of frataxin-\ncontrolled metabolic pathways; frataxin replacement,\nstabilizers and enhancers; methods to increase FXN gene\nexpression; and gene replacement and gene\nediting therapies as outlined by the Friedreich&amp;#39;s Ataxia Research\nAlignment Alliance (FARA) [Zheng] That&amp;#39;s great. Thank you so much\nfor joining us today Dr. Ngo, and thank you so much for the\ninformative interview. I&amp;#39;m grateful for your time and the\namazing research you have shared. You have provided a\ngreat contribution to advancing the science of pathology and\nmedicine, and we&amp;#39;re really honored to learn from you today.\n[Dr. Ngo] Thank you so much.",

    "transcript": "i want to say i have this very good vitamin that i heard that helped many people who didn&amp;#39;t walk and now they could walk they are they are very in pain and now they&amp;#39;re in pain free oh oh wow how much is it oh 4.99 a month oh i get four or five bucks a month 499 a month oh yeah i&amp;#39;ll pass so what&amp;#39;s more important your wallet or your health hey everyone welcome back to my channel and today i want to talk about the expenses of when you&amp;#39;re you enter the wheelchair life you don&amp;#39;t realize how expensive this life actually is and hopefully we live insurance will cover a lot of the medical equipment but sometimes they don&amp;#39;t and so sometimes things have to come out of pocket and you&amp;#39;re just like where do i get the money and basically like i said in my previous video uh for those of us who are in the real world we didn&amp;#39;t didn&amp;#39;t ask for this lifestyle but and we didn&amp;#39;t realize how expensive this is and we had no say on what has happened so i can tell you from my personal experience i had no idea how expensive the slave was i just thought good wheelchair they live your life if only i could say that was actually true i think a lot of people would just think you just can&amp;#39;t walk and end up story um there&amp;#39;s a lot of other medical complications for those of you who are new to my channel i do deal with a neuromuscular condition called physical ataxia and what it is it causes damage in my nerves my muscles and my spinal cord and when i was 19 that&amp;#39;s when my wheelchair life began um so that&amp;#39;s like a brief summary of what i explained what phragic atexia is it does affect more um predicts is a genetic disorder i forgot to mention that so i do have six older siblings who do not have periodic ataxia and only i have fragile catastrophe and there another question that a frequently asked question is was i actually born with this and i would say yes i was but it wasn&amp;#39;t until i was 12 years old until it was fully activated um and then from there it kind of progressed and then by the age of 19 that&amp;#39;s when my legs just gave up and now i&amp;#39;m in the wheelchair now in the wheelchair world um so growing up you&amp;#39;re like [Music] so like let me um so people were actually surprised that i do have six six siblings who do not have physical taxia i know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s common for siblings to have it not just one but it does i&amp;#39;ve seen families where two out of three kids have it or twenty two out of two or three out of five so i i have seen siblings have had free trick attacks yeah because it is genetic um so either my so i believe it goes like when each parent carries the gene of fragixia um your child can either inherit the disease or kind of be a carrier uh for me i was the only one that carried both sides of the gene so when i was um when i entered the wheelchair world i i was like like manual wheelchairs i didn&amp;#39;t like realize like i thought i was like 400 bucks to get a realtor or i thought i would just go to hospital wheelchair and just continue on life um i didn&amp;#39;t really use there was actually custom wheelchairs like i didn&amp;#39;t know any of this stuff so someone might i i just go to physical therapy so they kind of recommended me a little wheelchair so i was 18 i think it was like 18 at the time and so like by the time it does take a process like four to six months to actually receive your village wheelchair so i was 19 when i got the wheelchair but then slowly but surely i just kept relying on the wheelchair and um decided the real life is now my life yeah so like entering this wheelchair life i didn&amp;#39;t realize how much is actually cost they cost around like two to six seven grand um depends on the features you get on the share but for most insurances will cover the cheapest uh wheelchair that&amp;#39;s just how insurance works um and sometimes they have to fight like like to get better quality for your wheelchair so you would have to discuss you and the insurance company from most cases um they do cover the minimum and a lot of stuff has to come out of pocket um if you want to upgrade your chair so for instance my manual wheelchair came with a solid filled tires and it wasn&amp;#39;t bad but i did want to go through with the airfield tires i&amp;#39;m considering this more litter wheat and i also went with the natural push hand rinse which insurance that i cover so um i just did everything out of pocket um with that and it wasn&amp;#39;t cheap and um so when i bought like new tires and new push rims um so i would say like anybody who uses a manual wheelchair and you get new tires just go to your local bike shop and they do it for you and they install it um they like wheelchair reserves kind of like bike tires um i think the only difference is bike tears are like much bigger than wheelchair tires and bike tires are much cheaper than wheelchair tires but they&amp;#39;re kind of like the same thing like custom electric wheelchairs range from 20 grand to 50. i might be wrong in that area considering i never had a an electric filter but i know they&amp;#39;re much more pricier than uh manual bulletin they do a lot of uh advanced things to their chair yeah so for um i trade many diets out there and tried different supplements tried different clinical trials tried different um i don&amp;#39;t know what i tried vitamins um but i firmly believe it it&amp;#39;s meant to be it&amp;#39;s gonna be and if god wanted me in this wheelchair then so be it um i believe if god wanted me in this position this is where i&amp;#39;m gonna be and still praise him in the meantime all right that&amp;#39;s all i have for today and please leave your comments like and subscribe and i will see you later bye",

    "transcript": "hello there again my name is scott let you all see a few i&amp;#39;ve been hunting before this here&amp;#39;s my family this is my mom patty betty west i&amp;#39;m petty officer bob you&amp;#39;ve seen her in a few other videos there&amp;#39;s one beside me here is my older sister and her name is sheree nelson and trey nelson just for the record how old are you i don&amp;#39;t know we don&amp;#39;t discuss just a little older than you i&amp;#39;m three years older than scott and how old is scott that&amp;#39;s not important that is 39 we do have one other little sister she&amp;#39;s not here right now she might be in the video later on we&amp;#39;ll find out anyways a little bit history i&amp;#39;ve been waiting for our video just like this originally was gonna be just me my mom but it was actually weird i just wanted to do that one yesterday but now we&amp;#39;re here in kentucky which is about eight hours away with mom and we have my elders here so i thought you know it might be better to get to me with two other people here well go ahead we&amp;#39;ll start off you know about some of my history because the things i&amp;#39;ve been through first off we&amp;#39;ll start with you know how i was born or not really how well pretty much the first symptom thought bob noticed about me and that would be when you started walking so we noticed that uh you were having you were stumbling a lot and falling and my mom actually is the one that said that he wasn&amp;#39;t walking as well as he should so it wasn&amp;#39;t until you were probably seven or eight years old before we went and had anything tested and um and then they it took a i think we took you to an orthopedic first and then they sent us to didn&amp;#39;t it start though because he had that place on his knee and he fell over and over and over again and kept busting that neighborhood right i feel like that kind of started some of it too some of the questioning as to why and he was following him it&amp;#39;s just accident prone we won&amp;#39;t go into all of them but i know he pulled the um ironing board down and pulled the iron on him and burned his arm and yeah pretty bad so just so it was a neurologist though that finally diagnosed you and i think you were nine ten years old maybe you remember i was in middle school you were when you were as a middle school nightmare we went we first met soccer in the local county class where he lived at well from there he died he told me the other specialists during the blockton school of medicine yeah which was insanely sorry and one thing is my dad always told me you know as a joke he always say that a gun came out with needles as long and so many well you forgot to leave out the part they let needles they said you liked videos they were that long that&amp;#39;s where they were poking through my arm and they were electrified as well hurt like hell so anyway we found out what he had and learned a little bit about it and then just went on with life so you know i&amp;#39;m like okay we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll figure it out along the way and we have so we&amp;#39;re at sheri&amp;#39;s house now and when we come down the only thing that we bring with us is the warrior lift and we use that mainly to get him uh out of the bed so we we have this cot where did you get it it costs it sams it&amp;#39;s just a folding cot and then he actually does okay in it he doesn&amp;#39;t fall out of it we can get him in the cup without the warrior but to get him out we have to use the hoyer lift so that&amp;#39;s the only thing we bring with us and uh we can travel pretty good and get around as long as i&amp;#39;ve got help to get him some ramps and and ramps we&amp;#39;ve got some rounds i do have stairs yeah and coming in and out of the house so um thank you so much in the garage you&amp;#39;ve got like three three so i have a set of portable uh ramps that extend they telegraph is that the correct tele is that the way you say it telegraph about they send them they extend that whatever the word is you use for that and then they uh put two of them down and get them at the right distance apart and push them up so if it works out well we&amp;#39;ll actually do a little bit of video so now we use those ram smart boarding when we head out if we have time we&amp;#39;re heading back to charlotte tomorrow so we haven&amp;#39;t come either uh might do that tomorrow if they&amp;#39;re signed about usually what&amp;#39;s the first thing that you notice i don&amp;#39;t know if i remember the first thing that i noticed um i do remember there being lots of accidents when we were kids um i can remember multiple times you know either mom or dad one saying hey we we&amp;#39;ve got to go to the hospital we need stitches get dressed we&amp;#39;re leaving yeah um never really knew what the issue was we just we left and we go get that taken care of but um it&amp;#39;s been comical along the way we&amp;#39;ve had a couple instances when he got older and we would go out with friends before before he was in his wheelchair and he was able to walk some we would support him so he would have an arm around me and an arm around whoever we were with and my husband now and at the time when we were dating we would take him out with us sometimes and um you know we walked up to a u of l game and we&amp;#39;re holding on to him and they&amp;#39;re like he can&amp;#39;t come in here he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s had too much alcohol no no no no he&amp;#39;s fine this happens all the time it&amp;#39;s normal this is normal so i just remember silly things like that um you know along the way i don&amp;#39;t know that i can remember how it started but i do remember those fun you know there have been other times like that too we&amp;#39;ve been out celebrating like especially let&amp;#39;s see the time i can talk about with you when i was eight year old place and this will be or something until which by the way we have moved all over the country now but we know zelda we i think it might be the dairy parties or whatever we went to horse getters that night i went to this little bar yeah same thing went in we had my husband and i bartended there was no something to let me interface yeah so we were who you were were you in a wheelchair full time then yes i was a wheelchair but you decided the best idea would be to leave the wheelchair yeah put it in the car and we&amp;#39;d just help you go in so we did the same thing packed him in and they told us he couldn&amp;#39;t come in or they wouldn&amp;#39;t serve him i&amp;#39;m like no no no he&amp;#39;s not drunk he&amp;#39;s this way all the time they felt that well it was funny but at the time the bartender felt really bad about it yeah so and we told her that you know what it was and we set him up the bar stool had a back on it so we put him in the bar stool and when she found out that it was something medically wrong she felt really bad but we all just laughed about it so we just laugh and go with it we all have our quirks about as well it&amp;#39;s good story sits out later it is my last name brothers we made

that we came here in a hurry because there was a little family issue about how they&amp;#39;ve gotten that take care of now but anyways i&amp;#39;d be ready to go whenever we can and we were afraid to go over whether we have the room whether it be in my elder sisters your sister&amp;#39;s as well okay we always are trying to be ready to go whenever we get me as long as i&amp;#39;ve got people around to help with uh as long as i&amp;#39;ve got enough people around to help with him we&amp;#39;re we pretty much go wherever we want to so as long as got people around i&amp;#39;ve got the hoyer

    "transcript": "will today so Dr Godley thank you so much for being with us it&amp;#39;s a pleasure thank you can you hear me okay yeah good so I just a quick story before I get started I was giving the talk a couple of years ago and I heard a cell phone ringing and my first reaction was I felt bad you know a person&amp;#39;s going to be embarrassed but it kept ringing and it was getting on my nerves you know that can pick up the phone already meanwhile it was by far and it was it was my daughter calling to ask how the speech went I said I&amp;#39;ll keep you posted so growing up the Mantra I heard was as long as you have your health as long as you have your help can&amp;#39;t be happy if you don&amp;#39;t have your health well I&amp;#39;m here to tell you after 42 years as a quadriplegic my health crap and it&amp;#39;s getting worse it&amp;#39;s so bad I tried to get a timeshare in the hospital but I&amp;#39;m happy more important I&amp;#39;m grateful how does it happen we go from despair maybe depression to well-being and even gratitude well it doesn&amp;#39;t happen right away and it can take years so let&amp;#39;s start at the beginning the diagnosis we see the first symptoms and we try to ignore it we see an unsteady gait and we tell ourselves it&amp;#39;s a bad day or it won&amp;#39;t be here tomorrow or it&amp;#39;s not that big a deal and the anxiety we feel gets buried inside I&amp;#39;m like a colleague of mine once said all buried emotions are buried alive they&amp;#39;re in there and then the symptom gets worse or we see it a second symptom maybe impairment of Vision or hearing in we can&amp;#39;t deny it anymore so with all our anxiety and fear we go to the doctor and we hear the dreaded words Frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia when I had my accident was on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and I was going westbound the truck was going eastbound and he lost his whole wheel not just the tire but the metal feel and it bounced across the turnpike and crashed my car and broke my neck I didn&amp;#39;t see it all unfolding the last thing I saw was a black thing I don&amp;#39;t look like it was just a few feet from the windshield so I was hit by a Blackfoot probably everybody in this room has been hit by a black thing so what follows the aftermath of this dreaded diagnosis or accidents for me it was Terror about the future no sadness no grief just Terror and rage we wonder why range I consider rage a Judicial emotion rage is a reaction to Injustice and we have all experienced Injustice whether you have Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia or love someone who has it you&amp;#39;ve experienced not just a loss but the experience the internal experience is that a theft something was stolen from us we don&amp;#39;t have anybody to blame although if you&amp;#39;re like me you look for someone to play it&amp;#39;s a theft so what&amp;#39;s been stolen well our bodily functions are Independence our sense of fitting in with others our sense of being like the other kids something we want from what second grade on we want to be like the other kids and we were robbed of our dreams for the future all stolen when I was in the hospital it seemed it every day somebody came in and told me something else I would have to live without that I&amp;#39;d never walk again or certain bodily functions I&amp;#39;d lose control over um every single day and then one day this is after I&amp;#39;ve been in the hospital a few days one day a nurse comes I had a full beard at the time one day a nurse comes in with the shaving kit the day before surgery my fusions I said what&amp;#39;s that for she said well you have a surgery tomorrow and we&amp;#39;re going in Phoenix so we have to shave your beard I said that&amp;#39;s not going to happen I thought I&amp;#39;ve lost enough you&amp;#39;re not taking my damn beard only thing I felt I had control over so she contacted her supervisor supervisor didn&amp;#39;t make any progress either the head of nursing they called her at Hope they wound up shaving just a quarter my beard I was out of control in a literal sense and we are not good at it at being out of control of course the twin of Rage is self-pity we can&amp;#39;t not have some self-pity I remember I was in rehab and I was looking at the windows it was McGee rehab which is uh 15th 16th and race and I was looking at the window out onto Ray Street it was winter and there was a man laying on a great homeless man and I looked at him and I said well at least he could get up and walk away realized my God I felt Envy of somebody who had no home that&amp;#39;s how low I was self-pity uh it&amp;#39;s poison we&amp;#39;re dumping poison into our body what restores it self-compassion that self-absorption not narcissism self-compassion kindness kindness towards this good person who suffers this person who at every turn in their lives tried to do the right thing successful or not this good person suffers that&amp;#39;s self-compassion a self-worth Society tells us we should be something we can never be again I remember I was invited to give a talk to a group of Physicians and I&amp;#39;m in the back of the auditorium they&amp;#39;re not seeing me there and they&amp;#39;re talking about how to give their patients bad news and a urologist raised his head and he said tell me how can I tell my patients with spinal cord injuries that they&amp;#39;re now half a man not listening and I&amp;#39;m thinking damn I wish I could empty my catheter bag on his foot oh but I did those are the stereotypes we live with huh you have an unsteady gait people think you&amp;#39;re either drunk or you&amp;#39;re intellectually impaired were both same with people in wheelchairs my daughter she was about six or seven years old we went out to a diner for lunch and the hostess says to my daughter where would he like to sit and I said to my daughter tell her I&amp;#39;d like to sit over there what we lived with nevertheless I didn&amp;#39;t feel useless and worthless I knew I was useless and worthless I was a burden of my family and I would be for the rest of my life in a very real way all that anger I felt I turned towards myself I hated my body because my body betrayed me I hated my life and I hated myself yes I was depressed and struggled to get out of bed every day every day I wanted to stay in bed because I didn&amp;#39;t want to face another day of quadriplegia and yes I didn&amp;#39;t think I wanted to live and believe it or not what I was experiencing was not a clinical depression we used to call PTSD a normal reaction to an abnormal situation that&amp;#39;s what I experienced a normal reaction to an abnormal situation you too it&amp;#39;s called reactive depression or technically it&amp;#39;s an adjustment disorder when you think about it that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing we&amp;#39;re trying to adjust to something that is really out of the ordinary what happens when we experience a divorce or sudden death of a loved one or life-altering diagnosis and generally talking about it with someone who loves you who understands who wants to understand we&amp;#39;re talking with Kindred Spirits like what we&amp;#39;re doing right here these last couple of days that helps meditation helps yoga helps exercise helps and he usually passes in time if it does not then it&amp;#39;s likely a major depression of clinical depression so how I said it was a struggle to get out of bed every day but I did I was afraid to stay in bed for even one day for fear I&amp;#39;d never get out again I got out major depression I would have stayed in bed and not gotten out uh it involves changes in sleeping in eating socializing we withdraw increased anxiety apathy excessive guilt those are all symptoms of a major depression and that needs intervention it&amp;#39;s helped therapy medication whatever we call this psychopathology I challenge that because Psychopathology implies there is pathology in your psyche there&amp;#39;s pathology in the world around you there&amp;#39;s pathology in what you have to live with but there&amp;#39;s not pathology in your mind most of you have read I imagine about the Mental Health crisis in this country especially with our children so in 2020 before covert right before there was a survey done and 10 of all children were diagnosed with anxiety disorder five percent were diagnosed with depression that&amp;#39;s a big numbers after covert 25 of all children in this country have a mental health diagnosis God I wish it was Treatment available for all of them but there&amp;#39;s not children with disability they have between two and ten times the chances of developing a mental health problem so let&amp;#39;s take a look at this we lost our health we lost our vision of the future we often lost our faith but to me the most painful is we lost our sense of belonging we lost our sense of being part of the herd for lack of a better word you know I looked around my hospital room and I watched people they were walking and talking and holding things in their hands I can&amp;#39;t do that am I still one of them I felt I&amp;#39;d lost my Humanity no longer like all of you I&amp;#39;ve never experienced anything that painful in my life that dangerous that lethal as loneliness that kind of of loneliness watching that feeling that I wanted to give up could live with it loneliness is lethal the American Cancer Society took a look at the impact of loneliness across races and genders adults who were lonely had a 30 percent increase in risk of stroke with the development of coronary artery disease 40 percent increase in a person&amp;#39;s risk for dementia loneliness is as toxic as a pack of cigarettes a day and what makes it worse is the shame that goes with it embarrassment that causes further withdrawal so here we are at that point and at some level we ask ourselves okay what now and everything changes because at some level we&amp;#39;re saying to ourselves all right this is what I have to live with now the question is how am I from I hear that my office almost every day I don&amp;#39;t know how I&amp;#39;m going to live with this I said give it time and look back in the rearview mirror and then you&amp;#39;ll have your answer because we do we do we find a way to live with what we have we pursue life I I told my family that I&amp;#39;d give it three years and then I would decide whether to go on or not and then at the end of three years took myself into my room and I thought about it do I want to go on and I negotiated with I don&amp;#39;t know my higher power my inner truth and I said okay give me hope that I&amp;#39;ll walk again and the voice back says no hope live or die unless they give me hope that I won&amp;#39;t be so sick no hope live or die it&amp;#39;s a hard bargain well it&amp;#39;s no secret when I chose and why I said I did it for my daughters or my wife or my parents or my patients there&amp;#39;s some truth in all of that but the real reason I did it was I chose life because I wanted to live sitting out on my uh deck a couple of years ago I looked over and I&amp;#39;ve got a bank of Windows and under it from the window to the floor is stucco and I looked over and I see in between the window and the stucco there&amp;#39;s a leaf and I figured it was a dead leaf that got stuck there so I went over to brush it off it wasn&amp;#39;t a dead leaf it was a live piece of ivy it was on the other side of the wall that Ivy found a crack in the wall and dug through insulation found a tiny hole in the stucco and found its way to the light all living things pursue life what now we pursue life after my accident right after as they were pulling me out of the car the last thing I remember is saying call everybody I know to get here right away somehow in my my delirium because I don&amp;#39;t remember the next 36 hours just in that moment I knew I needed the loving care of others to survive this we all do we can&amp;#39;t do this thing alone Teddy Pendergrass was a R B singer in the 80s he was world famous an accident became a quadriplegic and wound up seeing me I can talk about it with his permission and he wrote about our experience together he was suicidal and I worked with him for I don&amp;#39;t know a month six weeks two months and he made up his mind he was going to die so he&amp;#39;s leaving my office and he gets to the door and he turns around and he said well I guess I won&amp;#39;t see you again and I said you guess you won&amp;#39;t see me again told me he was ambivalent put them back in the office next session I brought him back in the office I brought his family in his son his wife and his mother and we talked about possibly losing him and I told him my recommendation that if he wanted to die let&amp;#39;s see what it&amp;#39;s like so I had him call everybody in the support network to come to his house at a certain day I said the same to his mother his wife and his son I went to his house had to be 120 people there we put a sheet over him so we couldn&amp;#39;t see and we had people one by one coming up to him to his grave and saying what he meant to them one by one by one and after five minutes probably less than that he wanted the Sheep off his head and he wanted to live why the loving care of others the loving care of others um one of the things we do I talked about shame is we withdraw that&amp;#39;s our instinct when we feel shame right we hide it we bury it we pretend it&amp;#39;s not there we lie about it we keep it buried inside and shame is like mold it grows in the dark it festers it can become lethal and what kills Bolt sunshine counterintuitive we open up what we&amp;#39;re ashamed of I had a young lady in my office 17 year old girl and and she was beating herself up for I don&amp;#39;t remember pimples or weight or whatever it was of course most 17 year old kids she was beautiful and it was hard to listen to it and you know I know better than that tried to talk her out of it or Challenger it was hard to listen and and I bent my head down at one point and when I did I saw that my catheter had leaked and my pants were soaked and I was almost too ashamed to raise my head back up I was that embarrassed and finally I did and she saw what was going on and I didn&amp;#39;t have language I didn&amp;#39;t have a word I could use she stood up without saying a word and came over to me and put her arms around me my head on her chest we just held each other two vulnerable humans caring for each other feeling compassion for each other even loving each other you know there&amp;#39;s a marquee on a church around the corner from me it said God is one and in that moment with that 17 year old girl that was divine when we are that close to another human being where our hearts are open where we share our vulnerability our most tender parts that is divine um I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;re many of you are familiar with uh a song from this show aspects of love but the lyrics of the song are love changes everything how we live and how we die and the more love we have in our lives the happier we&amp;#39;re going to be it&amp;#39;s just that simple it&amp;#39;s got nothing to do with how many people love you it&amp;#39;s how many people you love that you have control over and love is risky and it&amp;#39;s happened for me because the more you love the more you love the more you love the easier it is to love the less fearful of the risks I encourage people love who you love and tomorrow love them better love them deeper know how they hold their shoulders when they&amp;#39;re tired watch how they breathe when they&amp;#39;re stressed look at the color of their eyes love them that well and then the next day love somebody else that will the more you love the more well-being you&amp;#39;ll find yeah Love Changes Everything I charted some notes down a few years ago about the experience when life comes at you bare knuckled and bloodthirsty and rips away the sidewalk you had been walking on your whole life so there you are lying naked and beaten in an unfamiliar land without any familiar guide posts Beyond sadness grief and even loneliness there&amp;#39;s a feeling of isolation and inferiority towards the whole world so you hide your anguish and shame too scared to cry because if you do you might never stop and everything you thought was true is now gone so without a road map you get up frightened and fragile you take your first tentative step into the unknown future you go to doctors to heal your body but the scars are permanent you see other doctors to heal your broken heart but those scores are permanent also after the shock and anger and self-pity and resentment when you are too exhausted to fight against the truth of your life you finally cry oceans of Tears You Cry For All You&amp;#39;ve Lost and you grieve for what you had bid yesterday and then you might feel compassion for this good person who suffers and then perhaps compassion for all who suffers And So It Begins it&amp;#39;s different from before you find yourself not as strong not even strong enough to hide your own vulnerability and then you notice the air itself smells sweeter and the sun brighter your love is less tentative and more generous and You Begin loving more people and more people and more and all living things and loving seems easier than it did before and more abundant than ever before and you close your eyes and you hold your life before you and it&amp;#39;s only then that you realize all of this love comes through that scar tissue in your broken heart thank you everybody so do we have time for Q a or did I we do comments questions if there are people here who were removed from your speech like like I was what would you say is the first step in trying to figure out the jumbled mess inside your your head and your heart how how do we start down the road of sorting that out or or addressing it at all um I wonder if my meditation teacher Sylvia Borstein wrote a book entitled don&amp;#39;t just do something sit there uh don&amp;#39;t get so busy so far feel what you feel Let It Be There you know I get skid breakdown and I learned from my doctor that wounds to the skin heal at a rate of one millimeter a day and I wondered when he told me that what about wounds to the heart how long does it take for that to heal that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening I encourage you to have faith open up sit there feel your life and Watch What Happens don&amp;#39;t rush to live with this better the rush to be some kind of hero here just be who you are one of my other teachers said um the world is full of people trying to be filet mignon and deep down we know we&amp;#39;re meatballs so do what you do but don&amp;#39;t forget your meatball man nothing personal anybody else right thank you first of all that was very moving appreciate that so um you said something that resonated with me I have two children that suffer from this so I love what&amp;#39;s in this room that suffered from this so I considered my children as well um when that woman uh that young woman you said you were speaking whether you weren&amp;#39;t going to talk her out of the way she felt you&amp;#39;re right you&amp;#39;re not going to talk them out the way they feel because you&amp;#39;re just not what other things can you do for people like myself who are caregivers who love these beautiful what other things can we do that would really show that type of support besides all the great things we do already as a professional what other things would would you suggest the hunger to be known exceeds the hunger to be loved that&amp;#39;s what we want that&amp;#39;s you and I want we want somebody to know how we experience this life of ours so you were Trump is a very very difficult one is to sit with someone you love and all your helplessness and listen to their suffering your job is to tolerate your own helplessness it&amp;#39;s a hell of a job you know I wish it was easier for all of us that&amp;#39;s a great Act of love is to tolerate your helplessness with everybody not just your kids you know okay um so thank you for speaking um I I&amp;#39;m very vocal about the feelings I&amp;#39;m having with all this certain people in the community know some don&amp;#39;t um so going off the question about caregivers loving and being there supporting their family members or their friends with this disability or disease how does the community as a whole how do we open dialogue to have the tough conversations about when someone&amp;#39;s struggling what resources can Fair provide to a family you&amp;#39;re asking what resources this Farah hat yeah what what&amp;#39;s out there that Pharaoh could direct a family or even link Community as a whole to be like there&amp;#39;s these sources to use to help you understand or deal or cope with the world because right now it&amp;#39;s a terrifying place for everyone but especially the disabled community what do you need from my experience the world I have come to see it in a different point of view and when I try to reiterate it to my family members they don&amp;#39;t get it and that aspect I guess of it all of having these two point of perspectives or point of views is something that I think the community as a whole we kind of need to open that discussion or dialogue or door to be like everyone&amp;#39;s going to have a different point of view because the disease affects everyone differently but if we just take the step forward to be like let&amp;#39;s have these conversations I think you have touched on everything that I have been feeling for the past almost nine years since being diagnosed and sorry what a gift for both of us it&amp;#39;s uh you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll note that in my comments I didn&amp;#39;t talk much about symptoms or the physiology or I talked about my our internal life you say people don&amp;#39;t get it well they don&amp;#39;t they can&amp;#39;t but they can get a sense of helplessness and vulnerability and fear and they can get that and if we can have the courage talk about our internal lives you know uh brene Brown says that courage comes from the root of courageous see you are occur heart your courage is to speak from the heart so if we can be a courageous enough to speak from the heart people will get that thank you a friend but thank you I feel very grateful that you&amp;#39;re here today foreign you get to hug her down there I&amp;#39;m a little jealous this is anybody else well that young lady saying to me I want to thank you for for being so open for coming it&amp;#39;s good to be with Kindred Spirits so thank you everyone [Applause] let&amp;#39;s give ourselves a few minutes and whatever we need for ourselves and then we are going to our breakout sessions and there are three of them um we&amp;#39;ll have um folks out in the hallway to help you figure out which room you need to get to for each of the breakout sessions and then after an hour in the breakout session you can rotate to another one so of the three you&amp;#39;ll be able to go to two and then after the second breakout session we&amp;#39;re all going to come back here before we close the day so Dr Gottlieb thank you so much for being with us today um and sharing with our community [Applause] you take my microphone all right now can you guys hear me so I put it in the packet which breakout is where but in case you didn&amp;#39;t see that so in this room is um taking control of your care across the hall is going to be emotional health awareness and down this Hall straight back and on the right is have referred and that is where one voice can create change is going to be thank you foreign foreign foreign thank you foreign foreign foreign three years unfortunately foreign foreign so hilarious um foreign or you wanted me to hello all right everyone we&amp;#39;ve been asked to get started and I realize not everyone made exactly be in the room for this session you may just be left over from chatting and lunch but we we welcome you if that&amp;#39;s your circumstance you need to know I need the Bell oh yeah where&amp;#39;s Jen with her or you know what I had the yipe family like buzzers here earlier we may need to get them back and just be really loud about it all right thank you everyone for being here whether you&amp;#39;re here on purpose or you were sitting here when I started talking and you&amp;#39;re like well I might as well stick around they no problem um so I&amp;#39;m Shayna McCormick you all heard from me earlier I&amp;#39;m an endocrinologist at chop um you know when I we were talking about the title of this um session uh we&amp;#39;re talking about a healthcare transition and managing your medical care and Independence I&amp;#39;m going to offer you you thought this was a breakout session and I&amp;#39;m starting with slides but I promise it&amp;#39;s like three slides and I was asked to do it just to outline some of what I had envisioned we talk about but where what I&amp;#39;m outlining is just a starting place because these panelists are incredible and have lots and lots of insights to share and I imagine we&amp;#39;ll get even more from the group that we have so when we&amp;#39;re talking about Healthcare transition um I feel compelled to Define it so Health Care transition and definition from this website um called got transition.org which is a government-supported initiative to address problems related to health care transition so it&amp;#39;s the process of moving from a child or family centered model of Health Care to the adult model and the goals of transition are to improve the ability of Youth in young adults with and without special Health Care needs to manage their own health care and effectively use health services and to ensure an organized process in Pediatric and health care practice to facilitate transition and in case there are any adults in the room who thought oh you know managing your health care sounded good but this sounds pediatric focused I would say this session may still be helpful to you because as pediatric practitioners were were aiming to get our young our young patients to a place where they feel a lot of self-efficacy as adults and there may be adults who feel like they still need tips and strategies to achieve that self-efficacy and we&amp;#39;re going to be focusing a lot on that um so why do I care there&amp;#39;s a lot of data and increasing attention on Healthcare transition on moving from pediatric focused care to adult focused care and how well folks do as adults managing their medical care and the takeaway of all this research is that we do a terrible terrible job of preparing individuals for transition it&amp;#39;s not my area of expertise but as a clinician I have to take ownership of right of how well or how importantly we&amp;#39;re doing so there&amp;#39;s missed opportunities for helping people thrive this is a photo from the Olympics in 2012 of like a legendary baton drop and I feel like at the moment a lot of pediatric practitioners are dropping the ball dropping the Baton in transitioning to adult care so from a pediatric sub-specialist perspective we&amp;#39;re supposed to hand off like the Jamaican women right we&amp;#39;re supposed to develop educational guides talk about which of our patients are approaching transition assessing their Readiness to transition putting together all sorts of resources to help Focus folks function independently but we and then follow up after the fact to say how well are people doing managing their care it turns out that that all isn&amp;#39;t really happening the way it could so for this panel um we&amp;#39;re going to talk about what the experience of of individuals with fa have been and having met with this group of panelists before they have so much combined um experience and expertise that I definitely don&amp;#39;t have so you&amp;#39;re going to hear I hope some of the wonderful anecdotes that I heard and some also very practical and concrete suggestions to help achieve more Independence in managing care um so where we&amp;#39;re going to start is to ask I&amp;#39;m going to ask each of our panelists to introduce themselves tell us a little bit about what they do where they live what they do for fun um and then we&amp;#39;re going to move into questions for each of them and then also include include you on we have a relatively small group so folks should feel free to shout out even if before the formal audience q a you have something you&amp;#39;d like to contribute so we&amp;#39;ll start with you all righty hey everybody else I am 42. I was diagnosed um in 1992 so 30 years ago so hopefully it was a lot to tell you um I just got married got laid off I&amp;#39;m sorry I worked for 17 years full-time Hospital but it worked out because now I have time to work with me and I just I&amp;#39;m married last October and my husband&amp;#39;s right there videotaping congratulations [Music] in my wedding so that just shows how important fair is to me yeah hi I&amp;#39;m Christina cadoro I&amp;#39;m 32 years old I was diagnosed when I was 21 so 11 years ago um I am a daughter a sister a wife and a dog mom of a Puggle who&amp;#39;s just turned two years old um when I do for fun is I know I don&amp;#39;t look it but I like to go and eat um try different restaurants and a fun fact is recently my husband and I got to meet Robert Irvine and he was so nice and he took care of us um because the toy had a walker and it was hard to navigate through um where we were on the Russian but it was cool that someone like him I got to tell him about what fa is and what we go throughout the community yeah my name is Liam Dakari um uh they hadn&amp;#39;t come in about a month ago so my voice is nowhere to bring um I am at 32. um I have a wife and a four-year-old daughter um and um right now I&amp;#39;m working for the Department of Public Health in Philadelphia um and I used to work and get these end of Independent Living um and they&amp;#39;re wonderful I&amp;#39;m getting to later um and when I do pretty fun um I don&amp;#39;t I um I do it bro where it would um is really goofy and and not not very serious but uh it&amp;#39;s a lot of fun and I really recommend it to anyone who wants to uh can I get another shell wow that&amp;#39;s awesome thank you so if we if we have time left over we&amp;#39;ll just do listen to some improv at the end of our at the end of our session awesome um and Erin congratulations on your wedding that&amp;#39;s awesome so um we had planned a few questions ahead of time to get the discussion started so Aaron we&amp;#39;ll start with you um and our first question is can you describe any issues or experiences you have had with medical care when transitioning from Pediatrics to adulthood um really anything but we also included like medical decision making process access to your records or anything else that you think is um noteworthy during that transition so um I had a story that came to mine and I was not gonna share it but Tana said it was a good story it&amp;#39;s a good story so um I was diagnosed with 12. I went to every appointment now that I did but my mom and dad told me I went to every doctor and then I am turned 18. and nobody really knew what they were talking about it&amp;#39;s just a long time ago so I stopped going to the doctor when I was 18 and because nobody was telling me anything good so I went to and I drive an asphalt so I decided to no see a dog hunter a neurologist in Nashville so I went to harem it was probably true that Farish my Wednesday by myself um we did not have a good conversation I think he told me that I had five years left and I was by myself so I left the office now crying and I had to go back to work so I I wasn&amp;#39;t going back for a follow-up so now I&amp;#39;m entering and yeah about 2009 and he was the first doctor and then knew what he was talking about and was so hopeful and it wouldn&amp;#39;t even give me time for him he just told me what was going on encouraging so ever since then I&amp;#39;ve gone to Philadelphia and then six or seven hour drive and see Dr Lynch um and his whole staff they really changed my life for the better himself I make sure I see him for me every six months six months and um I would never I said Doctor but things are changing so I&amp;#39;m not telling people not to abduct I&amp;#39;m just saying things are different and people know what they&amp;#39;re talking about and if you can&amp;#39;t find men to go see that glitch well I appreciate you sharing that story when we said it was a good story good I mean I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m so sorry you went through that but it&amp;#39;s like incredibly illustrative right so you told us when you turned 18 like your folks had been facilitating and then you kind of fell off and weren&amp;#39;t going to anyone for a while so we want to avoid that for sure you also went to someone that was not a good fit and what we ideally do now if you&amp;#39;re transitioning either from Peds to adulthood or to a new sub-specialist or if you need a new specialty involved in your care the guidance suggests that we as Physicians do like what&amp;#39;s called a warm handoff meaning we contact the new specialist and then he you know you go to the appointment and then we may even see you once again after that appointment happens to see like how did it go and if you had gone back and said like this person knew nothing was ill-informed like maybe then someone might have found someone else for you so I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m glad it had a happy ending and the takeaway of seeing Dr Lynch being a great thought was a good takeaway too but I appreciate you sharing that even though it was tough because I think I think it was part of the motivation for a session like this one all right so um next question for um for Liam who also has amazing professional expertise in this area so listen up to the answer in particular question is when did you come to understand what your health insurance or other benefits do or do not cover and like how did you educate yourself on this big huge question that you can just get started answering what do people need to know about transitioning from their parents Insurance to their own insurance yeah thank you uh so uh it&amp;#39;s funny they use the word education so in 2015 I got my master&amp;#39;s degree in public administration um it was written around the time the Affordable Care Act um Obamacare and Pat past um and so we all kind of didn&amp;#39;t know how to research and reading around that um and I ended up being totally surprised uh by Health endurance and everything it was and even then you would have to get my masters so beyond me I complicated um I I broke my toe um in in school and it it ended up being kind of like several years of uh recovery and burdens deviation and stuff um and um over the over that time um I started working full time um and because of the complexities of Health Care and Medicare and Medicaid I lost my Medicaid coverage um so um I will kind of go more red to this later also but um you know they&amp;#39;re sort of uh particular piece of this word um um um having Medicaid and working full-time um getting off um ssis who I get that but um you you generally cannot work and I we are Medicaid in the same time they&amp;#39;re not in total uh um nervous in there but anyway um so I broke my toe and then on when I was on Medicare Medicaid um it was the paper it was fine um I had no issues everything was free pretty much um and then when I lost Medicaid I was so surprised by the cost of everything it died that I covered in copays all of a sudden um and um a bunch of other in cause for X-rays and so it was really kind of shocking um you know when I mean the system is just so complex um I really recommend just reading all the mail that you get um even though it&amp;#39;s it may seem kind of above your head um that that&amp;#39;s kind of them main way deserves that you need gets in touch with you their mail that&amp;#39;s really the only reliable way um no I I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend that as far as education um yeah um and and yeah maybe this Dad um in terms of like me coming out of your parents there&amp;#39;s I think it&amp;#39;s uh 26 years old it&amp;#39;s not like time a job now when you&amp;#39;re there it&amp;#39;s kind of like stay by state I believe that there&amp;#39;s some variability but um he uh clap down is that it&amp;#39;s really short it&amp;#39;s really complicated um yeah very complicated so thanks so much Liam and I feel like we&amp;#39;ve heard from our patients different anecdotes similar to yours that like I was in one way and then I either moved or I got a job or I got older or something happened and then broken toe whatever else it was that then there were some surprise medical bills generated and we&amp;#39;re going to keep talking as we go about resources um we were challenged in preparing for this event like each person&amp;#39;s circumstance here may be different you live in a different state your different age you may or may not be employed but there are some common resources including the gut transition website that I shared Social Work teams at the clinician um at your appointments where you go there are some folks who can like help with orienting you but and I like to read the mail advice to make sure that as things change that you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re getting a chance to hear about it and being aware of all these issues really is well part of what we wanted to accomplish with this session um so next question on this list for Christina um and the question is who accompanies you to medical visits now and Is this different from when you were younger or first diagnosed and follow-up to that is if you&amp;#39;ve been accompanied by your parents or caregivers in the past did the health care providers talk to you or did they talk to your parents or someone else or caregivers and um if they did talk to your parents or caregivers in the past how did you come to be the point person in your clinic visits so I was diagnosed at 21 but I started noticing symptoms at 17. and between from that time I was away to college five hours away so each break that I would come home I would go to different doctors it took four hospitals to figure out what I was wrong with me and what I had and I was finally diagnosed at Johns Hopkins but then he referred me to Dr winch in Philly so I&amp;#39;ve been going there since um but my parents have always come with me and they still do to this day and um I think Dr Lynch is great about making the patient the point person and asking you if you have questions first because it&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;re the one who&amp;#39;s going through everything and for advice that I have if you are going with your parents is to make sure you have that conversation first because what your parents are seeing is may not be the same thing what you&amp;#39;re feeling and going through or not seeing what you go through every day so I&amp;#39;m just having that conversation prior and coming up with questions together so I really like that advice I think it Bears repeating that I think Christina when we were preparing and you said that you would talk ahead of the visit sometimes or you think about talking you&amp;#39;d recommend folks talk ahead of the visit of like who&amp;#39;s going to cover what topics and if you don&amp;#39;t have a clinician like Dr Lynch who makes sure to engage you whose perspective may be different than the folks you&amp;#39;re bringing with you how to redirect that person towards you um you know as pediatric providers we&amp;#39;re taught to try to do this early on so that you develop those skills in a developmentally appropriate way right a 10 year olds can Advocate from for themselves and can start to learn to do that and graduate in a graduated way they can acquire more of that practice you look like you had a thought no no okay um but actually that was great Christina our next question is Aaron for you um and this I feel like maybe the subject of another you have you have a wealth of Rich anecdotes Aaron um can you give an example of when you have had to advocate for your medical care because you were with a doctor who was unfamiliar with fa ith so um like I said I just I used to always go with my parents and I was 12 so I didn&amp;#39;t really care or understood anything that was a little kid um now with Dr Lynch who is great he&amp;#39;ll talk to me but I recently went to a an urgent care clinic um because I had bought here um and Matt was with me and people usually talk to him and not me so I when the daddy I mean he didn&amp;#39;t know me at all and I understand how I sound so I said to the doctor just before I started I want to let you know that I don&amp;#39;t have any cognitive impairment that I understand how I sound you know people think they assume worse we&amp;#39;re slow because of our speech but once I told that she she was good just directed me so I was getting so it&amp;#39;s importantness stand up herself and and understand how you how you appear and how you sound to other other people and don&amp;#39;t get mad that just what are you gonna do like if I saw somebody that spoke like I do I&amp;#39;d probably speak a little slower too May enjoys help them there&amp;#39;s no one parent tell thank you so much for that so when we first um were talking about this question about who who gets spoken to you know the issue of doctors speaking only to the adult is common to folks with with fa but without fa with other because you know doctors forget to address the young person but the the suggestion you made you know how the speech differences could impact you know people&amp;#39;s assumptions about intellectual capacity and like a lot of Courage that you had to just like get right out ahead of it so that you could make sure your your needs were articulated directly I think that&amp;#39;s pretty remarkable and another really very concrete suggestion to folks who haven&amp;#39;t thought about it especially in like an emergency room setting where people may not be familiar with the condition at all um Liam I&amp;#39;m looking forward to this question because this came up as a kind of resource that folks may not be familiar with that we want them to be um and we&amp;#39;re lucky that you have a history having worked for a Center for Independent Living so we wonder can you give us an overview of what that is and what type of resources that kind of a center can provide for someone living with fa also where are these centers is there one in every state in the U.S yes so um centers for Independent Living um are across the country of their over 400 of them and there are they&amp;#39;re uh federally offended um so they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re partially public and so there is one I&amp;#39;m in your area I would recommend just Googling Center for Independent Living and then your ZIP code or canopy um and that should pull something up um they&amp;#39;re um their advocacy centers um they have like a bunch of and core and services they provide um but you know sort of most important and to this um uh session is a transition services so it includes the kind of transitioning from nursing homes to living independently but also just a transitioning from being a youth to an adult um and so um I I really recommend reaching out to your Center for Independent Living amen and they couldn&amp;#39;t kind of Coach you on the specifics uh if insurance change and benefits change um and um and they&amp;#39;re really valuable that way um they also most of them um hold classes around the good ones and the so um again um I recommend looking in your area but the old classes and like finance and uh the one in Philly even though it&amp;#39;s like um they have a kitchen and and two classes of the cooking I bet you&amp;#39;re managing Personal Care distance if you haven&amp;#39;t attended I&amp;#39;m learning so many things that I&amp;#39;m you know come up as here in transition to an adult um so they are so valuable um and I think there&amp;#39;s yeah that&amp;#39;s really helpful and I I recall it may be one of our panelists or someone else who was speaking you had an experience with the Center for Independent Living too I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m a little so I go to the Boston Center living and um they provide me with my PCA care so I never heard about it until after I stopped working so um they came and evaluated me and right now I have like 40 hours of care or something but when they first came two years ago um I really got like 30 hours or something and the woman said to me why didn&amp;#39;t you do this sooner to my advice is if you don&amp;#39;t need a lot of help right now get in with the center of Independent Living so that each year they can&amp;#39;t reevaluate and get more hours as you as you need more but start when you don&amp;#39;t need them that&amp;#39;s my tip I love the tip they&amp;#39;re accumulating yeah so identifying those centers early um so that you know what you&amp;#39;re eligible for and then continuing to revisit that I think that&amp;#39;s fantastic um next question goes to Christina um Christina can you describe some of your experiences um I think you may have used the word adulting someone did but like finding an apartment navigating public transportation requesting employer accommodations um really adulting yeah tell us more uh so I recently lived in Philadelphia but moved um with copen and everything but when I was living there uh during the time I did not take out any apartment um questions with disability because I was still at the point where I didn&amp;#39;t need that but I did rely heavily on public transportation so uh in Philly they had a program a theater disability it was a dollar a ride versus few dollars I forgot what it was but that helps because as we all know living with a disability is very expensive you always find yourself in a situation where you didn&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going to happen um and then same with medical devices just doing your research and I recently got a scooter so looking into resources and different companies what works best that&amp;#39;s really helpful so the public transportation funding like early on terrific so then we we have a few more kind of general questions for the panel and then we&amp;#39;ll open it up to more from the group um so these are some questions that I I had thought about because they come up with our patients um one was do you know how to reach your medical care team in particular if you have an urgent question after hours like so when the office is not open like do you know how to reach them overall and then like what about on the weekend or at night and anyone can feel this yes and start itself um I um I I recently started in um going on to the online portal for my Healthcare Providers um and you know it&amp;#39;s really been so valuable I mean many people probably have Dr Lynch who responds the emails new on Sundays uh that is amazing anyway but not every doctor is um and so yeah I really recommend online portals um I I say doctor through Penn and Jefferson health and both have um online uh health um sort of Bortles and you can e-message your doctor there um and usually within a day they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll respond um with a kind of non-urgent medical Western uh maybe if you have I I reached out to my cardiologist recently because I was sort of wondering about a certain thing and and you know the portal even let me take pictures um pictures of my foot because it turned into a certain color and I was like this does not look good I&amp;#39;m sorry I took a picture and um attached it to my email and through the message and then you know yeah Within 24 and Edwards my cardiologists got back to being accepted the color was okay uh yeah I really recommend I don&amp;#39;t recommend that my answer was I have started doing intense video I don&amp;#39;t think they like that answer we we love that I mean you know although um so this is the online portal for like non-urgent but like between visits or you kind of need the answer but you know you want a more efficient way of getting to someone I love that I love trying to reach Dr Lynch too except for sometimes you&amp;#39;re concerned maybe not neurologic although he&amp;#39;s super knowledgeable outside that too isn&amp;#39;t he um from an endocrine standpoint for our patients with diabetes like and I think this would be true for your cardiology practice or others there&amp;#39;s an on-call team 24 7 and you can page with urgent questions and some people um hopefully most people&amp;#39;s Specialists would have that but I would encourage folks to ask at your visit like if you&amp;#39;re seeing a specialist like hey if we have a question you know between visits do you have a portal where we can upload that or do you have an on-call team who can address urgent questions so that there&amp;#39;s something between you know doing nothing or hoping Dr Lynch is going to answer as quickly as usual and going to the emergency room where um where you know to be avoided if you don&amp;#39;t really need it right so you um we want to make sure folks feel like they have more resources there um so last question for the panel actually related to Emergency Care um and I think Christina you may have had a tip but we may start with you on this one um so if you need emergency medical care like if you were going to an urgent care or an emergency room either with or without your family present would you know how to share all of your information like what are your health problems what are your medicines your insurance information that kind of thing do you have that in one place or how how do you communicate it and if there are folks unfamiliar with fa Beyond um you know being being told about the the fact that folks can communicate for themselves like how would you share more information about fa so I feel like you told us something that I thought was helpful um so I was away for college um when I was diagnosed so I had two Tire tips um one was a medical bracelet just so other people can know if I ended up having to go to the hospital with something were to happen um I would have like my emergency contacts on the back what a is and the main source like cardiomyopathy um so I had that and then I also carried around a card that in my wallet what fa is because I was 21 and wanted to go out to the bars I&amp;#39;m so just so people knew I wasn&amp;#39;t drunk or anything so just um just having that even not doing that going out to the bars I don&amp;#39;t want to make it to make it was just for that but um just to always have that information because not everyone knows yeah when I was 21. I was also getting kicked out of a lot of bars so I had a little uh National Ataxia Foundation I had laminated so it looked official and that&amp;#39;s hard to get into bars not go home Craig yeah I think I would say also that um um you know there&amp;#39;s sort of like an existential part of this Theory like sort of a deeper part um that I you know I I think transitioning from being um you know having your parents sort of adds this like around the clock advocating to like be able to communicate to your health um providers sort of about yourself and um not having that Lifeline um I mean I&amp;#39;m sure the parents you know still exist but they might not always be around uh for the rest of your life and and so I would you know the deeper uh is understanding when you need and and what your your body is like the specifics of your your medical care I&amp;#39;m having like I&amp;#39;ll literacy around um you know the things that you need so you can um communicate with them you know energy and care and provider um on sort of the intricacies um you know I&amp;#39;m saying that as uh somebody who does not know everything and you know and everything after it today you know just spent so much of it goes over my head and so I&amp;#39;m in but um you know I I think I would say kind of a uh educating yourself um advocating for yourself starts with um I started with understanding yourself a man being able to live independently and and um yeah I don&amp;#39;t know I feel like I&amp;#39;m staying on the soapbox now but does that make sense I love your soapbox so we started with talking about the emergency room and we went quickly to college and existential thoughts and and bars and so you know these discussions extend well beyond to add just for preparations like some of our patients with diabetes or some with other complex health conditions some people carry like a piece of paper summarizing you know their their meds or their health conditions and um as you know Jen introduced earlier this morning the updated care guidelines will be around soon so providing a link to those because folks who are unfamiliar could refer to those and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s hopefully going to be an easier to navigate resource too so um adding to practical suggestions I think we have a little bit of time left in session right for anybody to I think I&amp;#39;d encourage you to ask questions of our awesome panel because they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re far more knowledgeable in the practicalities of navigating this than I am Vote or or points that people may want to make their own their own stories we welcome them so um these services start whenever in the under 18 um you know and if um yeah you know I mean medical insurance it&amp;#39;s in subject and worms um men sometimes for Independent Living um I&amp;#39;m working on transition um this was everything um so they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re federally funded to help people who are under 18 I&amp;#39;m so if they if they don&amp;#39;t they should be and yeah there&amp;#39;s one in the back hi um I&amp;#39;m just curious do any of you guys have a spouse or a parent that functions as a personal representative for you guys and if if they do what does that relationship look like I may not the term might be different um basically somebody that is able to make medical decisions on your behalf if you&amp;#39;re not able to or any of that ringing a bell I haven&amp;#39;t all have an awfully a message it&amp;#39;s all my decisions are written down and my mom is my my mom and Matt or my healthcare proxy so yeah I would assume yeah no whatever answer you have is valid so it sounds you know the personal or somebody people may use like healthcare proxy or power of attorney in different contexts so just it&amp;#39;s just as you say sometimes you may anticipate a circumstance where you may not be in the position to make your own health care decisions and so how have you anticipated that it sounds like right and so for you you have your mom and your partner who are both in in that role who can like make decisions on your behalf and I have it all written down so and so getting it all written down I don&amp;#39;t really have to make any decisions they just read you just for clarifying so there&amp;#39;s the writing down of like who those people are right like yes this person is my health can serve as my healthcare proxy Etc but it sounds like you&amp;#39;ve gone further to articulate kind of what your preferences are is that right okay yeah Indiana School and you know to recessed at you but after a while like I don&amp;#39;t want to be in a machine forever try out this to the work and then I can pull the plug or whatever it&amp;#39;s all written down that sounds like you&amp;#39;ve had those important conversations about what your preferences are and written them down to try to help your your um Healthcare proxies should that circumstance arise yeah does anyone else is that what you&amp;#39;re getting at sorry yeah does anyone else want to share their experience I might now you don&amp;#39;t deeply my wife&amp;#39;s the nurse I&amp;#39;m an and graduated in I mean sort of a nurse practitioner as of yesterday so yeah I&amp;#39;m a great room and um yeah and I I don&amp;#39;t have much experience in there but that&amp;#39;s the thing about yeah something something to think about to have articulated for sure especially was when you&amp;#39;re turning 18 right because then the default goes from your parents or caregivers to whomever you&amp;#39;ve designated um so important to have those conversations I would just add as a systems issue if you do have a durable medical power of attorney or a power of attorney in some other fashion or Advanced directives it&amp;#39;s really important you let your Healthcare Providers know that because if they don&amp;#39;t know that it&amp;#39;s essentially a an unknown to them so those are really great documents to have like very forward thinking very forward-looking like very very important stuff to have but it doesn&amp;#39;t mean much if the hospital system you treat with or your providers don&amp;#39;t have that and then there&amp;#39;s also some advice and I don&amp;#39;t know what it would be about how to have that in play if you&amp;#39;re out of your jurisdiction and have to go to the emergency department so if if you have informed your local hospital system the emergency department you go to should know about those you know durable medical power of attorney the the advanced directives but if you&amp;#39;re traveling or something along those lines I don&amp;#39;t know what best practices would be in terms of making sure those documents travel with you you&amp;#39;d if anybody had comments on that I&amp;#39;d be interested to hear um practically speak usually outside the scope of what we do in Pediatrics but we do care for some folks that are over 18 that like when you&amp;#39;re outside the typical range it seems very um old school to have like pieces of paper but like if you have a binder or you have in a binder is comprehensive so the ER folks can&amp;#39;t like go through fast but if you have something concise it&amp;#39;s like one page about the history and copies of those documents like those would be um potentially very important but um making a really great point that like those preferences that you&amp;#39;ve articulated um and the decision-making power you know needs to be made aware to folks so thank you for that is that is that time if this timer is accurate yeah oh here&amp;#39;s I think there&amp;#39;s one more oh but all right one more question yeah Aaron uh just how many bars were you thrown out of thanks Dad I I actually wouldn&amp;#39;t get there allowed I wouldn&amp;#39;t get in that was Minecraft all right well thank you everyone yeah thanks everyone for coming [Applause] okay so we have 15 minutes until the second round of breakout starts so everybody has a few minutes to to hang out and we&amp;#39;ll wait for the other rooms to finish and then you guys can move on to whatever one that you want to go see next so over there is emotional health awareness and then down the hall on the right will be advocacy and they might be finishing up so definitely give them a few minutes to finish up and we&amp;#39;ll rotate through yeah okay great what do you think oh okay like we practice oh yeah absolutely for a second so you wouldn&amp;#39;t get into the bar huh no did you have bar issues like not getting into bars yeah every day",

voluntary muscle control and coordination patients experience muscle weakness difficulty walking and loss of sensation and reflexes the loss of pancreatic beta cells leads to decreased insulin production and the development of diabetes and finally the loss of cardiomyocytes in the heart leads to hydroperfect cardiomyopathy or the abnormal thickening of the heart which can lead to heart failure and this is the most common death for patients with friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia hello there welcome back to another episode of rare diseases rare disease review is a not-for-profit medical journal organized by students from the university of toronto mcmaster and western university this podcast is created by the branch of western university the podcast aims to advocate for rare disease awareness and promote students involvement in the rare disease community we appreciate your listening and support today for further information on scientific translation of rare disease information please visit www.rarediseasereview.ca the content of this podcast is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice diagnosis or treatment so please always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition never disregard professional medical advice or delayed in seeking it because of something you have heard from this podcast my name is song and you&amp;#39;re listening to the rare disease podcast for this episode we&amp;#39;re going to dive into a rare heritage disease called physics ataxia physics ataxia is a genetic progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder the typical age of onset is between 10 and 15 years the initial symptoms of physics ataxia includes unsteady posture frequent falling and progressive difficulty in walking due to impaired ability to coordinate voluntary movement which is why it is called ataxia the affected individual often develops slur speech called dysarthria characteristic through deformities and an irregular curvature of the spine called scoliosis physics atassia is often associated with cardiomyopathy a disease of cardiac muscle that may lead to heart failure or irregularities in heart rhythm called cardioarrhythmia people with phrygic ataxia have a higher chance to get diabetes physics potassium presents degenerative changes in sensory nerve fibers at the point where they enter the spinal cord in the structure known as dorsal root ganglia which results in secondary degeneration of nerve fibers in the spinal cord leading to a deficiency of sensory signal to the cerebellum a part of the brain that helps to coordinate voluntary movements physics octassia is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the fxn gene which calls for a protein called fructoxin to better understand the scientific research on friedrichs ataxia i spoke with dr noe a phd graduate from department of pathology and laboratory medicine at western university dr noel focused her studies on the cellular and molecular mechanism of oxidative stress which in frederick ataxia is an important contributing factor in the progression of the disease welcome dr no it&amp;#39;s our honor to have you with us here to speak about futurecatasia today thank you so much for having me yes to start off can we get to know a bit about your work well i recently completed my phd in pathology and laboratory medicine at western university and my research focused on a protein called nrf2 the transcriptional master regulator of a cellular oxidative stress response so oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between the production and accumulation of harmful free radicals in cells and tissues and the ability of a biological system to detoxify these free radicals oxidative stress is implicated in a multitude of human diseases including frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia where it plays a major role in the progression of the disease well that&amp;#39;s very fascinating i&amp;#39;d really love to hear more about your research when you get a chance in the future now for today could you give us a little bit of the insight into the cause of phragic ataxia frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia is caused by a mutation in the fxn gene on chromosome 9 that encodes for a protein called frataxin it is an autosomal recessive disease meaning an individual must inherit two abnormal copies of the fxn gene from both parents to express symptoms of friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia this inherited mutation causes an abnormal repetition of three dna nucleotides gaa or guanine adenine adenine known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion in normal individuals this gaa sequence is repeated approximately 7 to 38 times within the fxn gene however in individuals with free-range ataxia this gia sequence is repeated anywhere from 66 to over 1 700 times this trinucleotide repeat expansion causes gene silencing in the fxn gene resulting in little or no production of this protection protein that&amp;#39;s really interesting so frat toxin protein is being affected in this disease for the patient to develop phytic ectaxia what is the role of fractaxin ritexan is involved in the incorporation of iron into iron sulfur clusters which serves as various enzyme cofactors including mitochondrial enzymes involved in electron transfer and ultimately mitochondria atp production with insufficient fataxin two key outcomes occur firstly mitochondria are unable to incorporate iron into these iron sulfur clusters resulting in decreased mitochondrial atp production and insufficient energy for the cell secondly these unused iron accumulates in the cell and reacts with oxygen to form harmful free radicals resulting in oxidative stress over time and ultimately oxidative damage if not remedied this reduction in cellular atp combined with oxidative damage results in cell death specifically in neurons and cells of the pancreas and heart where fatoxin is normally most highly expressed thank you so much so with these changes at cellular level what kind of symptoms and signs a patient might present the death of neurons cardiomyocytes and pancreatic beta cells results in the clinical symptoms of the disease the loss of neurons in the brain leads to ataxia defined as a lack of voluntary muscle control and coordination patients experience muscle weakness difficulty walking and loss of sensation and reflexes the loss of pancreatic beta cells leads to decreased insulin production and the development of diabetes and finally the loss of cardiomyocytes in the heart leads to hydroperfect cardiomyopathy or the abnormal thickening of the heart which can lead to heart failure and this is the most common death for patients with friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia well this is very critical conditions so how may a patient be diagnosed and treated currently phoenix ataxia is diagnosed by genetic testing to identify the trinucleotide repeat expansion in both copies of the fxn gene in addition to brain images scans nerve conduction studies blood tests and cardiac tests unfortunately at the time there is no cure for freedox ataxia and currently no approved therapies for the treatment of this disease treatment is focused on minimizing symptoms and maintaining comfort and muscle function options for this include physical bracing of limbs physiotherapy speech therapy occupational therapy corrective skeletal muscle surgery and medications to treat heart disease and diabetes importantly ongoing research has been conducted with hopes of a cure so with all the wonderful information you presented here could you tell us about the research side of frederick ataxia and how this is related to your research as mentioned frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia is a result of decreased production of the protein for toxin which can impair mitochondrial function and cause oxidative damage this oxidative stress induced damage in friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is a particular interest to me and so i&amp;#39;ll take a moment to discuss some of the current work that is being done in this area the free radicals such as those produced in frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia can damage cellular dna proteins and lipids resulting in cell death the cell contains various mechanisms to detoxify these free radicals and this is cheaply controlled by the protein transcription factor nrf2 which i mentioned before nf2 is responsible for activating the cellular antioxidant response so essentially more nrf2 means less oxidative stress thus molecules that can activate nrf2 may have the potential to induce clinical benefits in patients with friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia a 2019 study by petrillo and colleagues compared different nrf2 activators for the treatment of frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia they found that sulforaphane and acetyl cysteine were particularly effective on genes involved in preventing inflammation and maintaining homeostasis homeostasis for the antioxidant glutathione and that dimethyl fumarate omaxivolone epi 743 were effective in counteracting toxic products accumulation and finally that they found positive effects of idebenone on mitochondrial protection other studies have found similar benefits for nrf2 activators in improving mitochondrial function reducing oxidative stress and inflammation and ultimately preventing cell death in the brain heart and pancreas well that&amp;#39;s incredibly fascinating with these great progress in research what do you think is the direction of future research collectively this suggests that the development of synergistic therapies based on a combination of nrf2 activators may have therapeutic benefits to patients with fetix ataxia such research is currently ongoing and in addition to reducing oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial function other areas of friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia treatment research include modulation of fratoxin-controlled metabolic pathways for toxin replacement stabilizers and enhancers methods to increase fxn gene expression and gene replacement and gene editing therapies as outlined by the friedrichs ataxia research alignment alliance f-a-r-a that&amp;#39;s great thank you so much for joining us today dr no and thank you so much for the informative interview i&amp;#39;m grateful for your time and the amazing research you have shared you have provided a great contribution to advancing the science of pathology and medicine and we&amp;#39;re really honored to learn from you today thank you so much",

    "transcript": "the national guests this Sunday tomorrow is in the general elections time so when we designed with Euro Euro Ataxia this conference actually the government hasn&amp;#39;t informed us of course of this general election and that&amp;#39;s why that was a very huge burden with uh for us so because we have done the commitment that we have made our commitment to our partners that was very difficult to change dates uh that&amp;#39;s the reason that why our main neurologists the ones that we cooperate with they are coming out of all places in Greece uh speaking through Zoom I will we will start in in one minute I see everyone is coming and that&amp;#39;s the reason that we have made this this modification foreign we will start by introducing our first for the Greek panel let&amp;#39;s say speaker of the day which actually is Professor kimiskidis Vasilios I salute everyone I salute Professor Kursi squeeze I see him online the professors professor karadema and professor vasilius kimis professor dinoplos is here with us unfortunately he had a bad headache and he&amp;#39;s not going to to join us so we will without further Ado sorry for letting us for letting you uh let&amp;#39;s say a little bit late out of the schedule it has been a wonderful sessions uh till now and this is the reason that the schedule has fall a little bit behind but without further Ado I will introduce professor who is a professor in neurology in a professional in neurology in HEPA University Hospital in Thessaloniki and Aristotle University he is a a very good friend of our association and very and very and we are very happy and fortunate that we we cooperate with him professor kimis kid is the the floor is yours so dear colleagues ladies and gentlemen first of all please let me express my sincere thanks to the Hellenic federal tax Association and to vasilis carriages in particular organizing this event and of course for the kind invitation to participate so my disclosures so in the next very few minutes I will outline the care of fa patients at my Center which is located at the ahepa hospital of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki the care of these patients actually takes place at the NDA neuromuscular unit India HEPA Hospital and it reflects a collaboration between the laboratory of clinical neurophysiology which is led by Associated Professor Maria Antonov the second University Department of Pediatrics which is represented by Professor evangelos Pablo and the first Department of Neurology which is directed by me and I would like to stress the importance of the close collaboration between pediatricians and adult neurologists because these close collaborations ensures the smooth transition of patients from the care of the former the pediatricians to the care of the latter the adult neurologist currently we follow and care for a cohort of 13 adult fa patients age 17 to 47 years with a mean age of 29. and the essence of this girl is crystallized in the word Maldives discipline narrative all patients typically attend our unit on a manual basis once per year not including of course extra visits should any emergency any special issue okay and during each one of these visits the patients are sequentially examined by a neurologist who is leading the overall care as well as a cardiologist an orthopedic surgeon a pneumonologist a physiotherapist and a psychologist in addition to that consultations by all relevant Specialties for instance or pharmacologists entice clinical geneticists or specialists in diabetes are arranged as needed while the patient is on the side and in my humble opinion this is a major advantage because mobility issues are of obvious importance to sa patients and therefore the minimization of transfer time of transfer cost and transfer effort is considered highly beneficial by both patients and their caregivers now just a few words about the contribution of each member of our team the neurologist has already said is the overall coordinator he or she assesses the patient urologically at its visit with clinical measures standard measures such as sorrow and fast and summarizes an assesses the results of all other examinations and assessments such as cardiac biochemical neurophysiological or Imaging and thereby he can monitor both the primary and the secondary symptoms of the disease but he is the coordinator our physiotherapist is involved in the design and the monitoring of The individualized Rehabilitation plan I will not enter in details but certain key elements of this plan which of course is designed based on the ambulatory status of the patient assuming the slide one particularly important facet of the collaboration between the physiotherapists and the neurologist is the management of spasticity as a first step non-pharmacological measures such as strengthening and muscle stretching are introduced by the physiotherapist but as a second step permalogical measures both systematic drugs as well as local pharmacological measures for instance botulinum toxin are used at our department are notable in particular has the expertise to utilize effectively these three in inappropriate cases the contribution of the cardiologists cannot be overemphasized he is on site I repeat and performs ECG and echocardiography on each and every visit and should concerns about cardiac arrhythmias emerged he arranges everything he arranges holy monitoring or Loop recordings or any other appropriate investigations and interventions the pneumonologist is also on site and provides a comprehensive assessment of respiratory function but also explores the presence of sleep disordered breathing and arranges appropriate testing and management the orthopedic surgeon again is also on science all these people gather together when the patients arrive and routinely perform spinal examination Monitors care progression and provides helpful suggestions about bracing about scoliosis surgery and about the management investigation osteoporosis last but not least our psychologists screens or mental health issue or patients for the presence of depressions for the presence of anxiety or psychosis this is extremely important she also provides a first level of management but if needed patients are readily transferred readily referred to science countries for further pharmacological treatment I previously mentioned that consultations by other Specialists are readily available at our unit let me give you just two examples for instance patients with swallowing difficulties so for these patients a comprehensive assessment by a relevant ENT expert is visible is available and then on the basis of the results He suggests strategies to overcome this video and similarly a consultation by an ophthalmologist is regularly requested to assess vision and also rule other other causes of vision deterioration in these patients non-essa related causes or of course the presence of diabetic retinopathy finally speaking of treatments all of our patients receive symptomatic medications for the various aspects of the disease as already mentioned and through them just through them received Q10 and vitamin E now why three of them these were ambulatory patients that had low levels of both Q10 and vitamin E so we decided on the basis of some fairly low quality evidence admittedly to administer them however none of our patients receive specific fa treatment I referred to skylaris of course and it would be a major fit for all patients in Greece if this would be visible for instance By An Early Access program and I believe that I Echo the opinion of all uh our Greek colleagues on this issue we are hopeful that the management seemed that I outline covers the needs of our patients at least to some degree of course more can be done and more should be done to improve further the management of these patients and ideally it should be done through collaborations collaboration with the Hellenic federal tax Association and of course with all other centers in Greece and abroad and I would be happy to discuss any specific aspects on this issue so I thank you for your attention thank you Professor thank you for uh this uh concise presentation of the capabilities that we have at our HEPA uh University in Thessaloniki and I welcome a professor zaffirio dimitrios who is a pediatric neurologist and uh he is uh the head of the Hippocratic University Hospitality Thessaloniki pediatric neurology Services uh he uh he will speak about also the capabilities that they have in their Center and how they they manage our patients in their Center Professor the the floor is yours thank you very much Mr karachias for this wonderful opportunity to gather with other colleagues all among Europe uh unfortunately in a difficult weekend for Greece uh I mean organization from an organizational point of view uh I wish you know that I have mass first to be with you uh at uh dohoro at this very moment but unfortunately uh some problems that uh arise through this election weekend made this impossible but again thank you very much for this very kind invitation to talk uh I think on behalf of my other colleagues pediatric neurologists in Greece but mainly for saroniki and from the scope of the child neurologist regarding the opportunities and the possibilities that we have to uh follow diagnospheres follow and why not provide [Music] a more substantive therapy for patients with free drugs attraction I will not have any slides uh I think that vasiliski miskiris made a wonderful introduction because more or less uh uh this collaboration scene that is followed in a HEPA hostel for adult patients with fried rice Ataxia is more or less what we are doing in hypocratio hospital but I would like to underline some special aspects of freedax ataxia regarding the Pediatric AIDS first that most of these patients they do have their Fair symptoms during the first two decades of life so I think that uh first it&amp;#39;s the uh duty of a pediatric neurologist to diagnose pre-dixotaxium there are of course some patients that manifest symptoms after the second decade of life but most of these patients they do present in pediatric age so we have this special knowledge of these symptoms which are mainly neurological uh we follow more than 10 patients pediatric patients under 17 years and I assume that at least three or four of the patients that are followed in a HEPA Hospital our patients first diagnosed by us at hippocratician uh a clinical hospital at the First pediatric clinic uh we have the same way to follow these patients uh it&amp;#39;s a multidiscing disciplinary approach with the neurology or the neurologist organizing uh the follow-up but also having other doctors I would add here also the endocrinologist the Pediatric endocrinologist because as you know better than myself diabetes is a common manifestation of Freedia cataxia and we need to also help in this issue we have a the whole range of physical therapists in gratio there&amp;#39;s a special Developmental Center called Center focus where we have the occupational speech Therapies in the physical therapist and we are trying to uh uh stay in line with uh what their colleagues in special centers all over the world are doing regarding the scales that are used the motor scales I mean but also swallowing scales and every other scale trying to make us speak a Common Language when we refer to these patients and this is very important I&amp;#39;ll come very quickly to what I think is the most important aspect of my presentation to you because this way having all these Specialists and having all these knowledge as our colleagues abroad make us uh very capable of uh taking part into clinical trials and this is something that I would like to underline my Center participates in more than 20 clinical trials more than eight having to do with neuromuscular disorders uh epilepsy multiple sclerosis and all um all uh other areas of pediatric neurology and I think this is something that uh three years give us knowledge about uh how we can proceed with these patients and uh having a meticulously follow up as vasilis explained to our little pediatric patients so the same is true also for uh one or two centers in Athens of course my good friend and colleague are gears dinoplus uh almost participate in every trial that we are uh are well and we have our collaboration with our adult colleagues and we are trying to make this transition uh possible however as you may well know sometimes the Pediatric patients are stuck into pediatricians or pediatric neurologists and this is something that needs to be further worked on uh in order to ensure a smooth transition from pediatric to adult age it&amp;#39;s very important that in cases where new therapies new Innovative therapists Precision therapies uh arise we can work together with our colleagues adult neurologists this was the case in uh at least two novel medications for therapies for spinal muscular atrophy and I think that we are more than ready to uh uh have patience both Pediatric and adults uh participate in any new clinical trial but also to give them the opportunity to try at least uh the novel medication that has already got permission from the FDA uh regarding Friedrich ataxia but apart also from friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia and because this is as uh a series told me Euro Ataxia project of course we all know that Friedrich Ataxia is the most common actually at least a genetic attacks at least in childhood but I think there is the knowledge of the people here and the possibility to work multi-disciplinary to diagnose other forms of inherited ataxias uh also through the genetic you know very well that we diagnose at least 70 percent more spino several taxias or spinal a Heritage plastic caplesias or some metabolic disorder like for example disorders that may mimic [Music] so I think that Greece is more than ready and I speak for matante saluniki but I assume it&amp;#39;s the same for Athens to uh help with patients in a scientific way done in other parts Europe and America as well uh regarding therapies I think that uh mostly uh our patients my patients receive supportive therapy uh six of the ten patients receive a dependent uh and we have seen some stabilization but to be honest we don&amp;#39;t have a measure apart from uh typical cardiologist measurement regarding the wall of the thickness of the wall of uh the leventricle to say that this works but at least from a cardiologist&amp;#39;s point of view our little patients are doing relative well I know that we don&amp;#39;t have too many evidence of proof or a debit on but many patients uh read some papers that although contradictory they maybe report a small benefit so that&amp;#39;s why we are giving I don&amp;#39;t think there is a robust body of evidence for any other therapist like vitamin E or uh coenzyme q but you know better than me that where there&amp;#39;s no therapy every therapy even with a very very tiny positive effect is better than no therapy uh with his words I say that we are ready to cooperate with our pediatric colleagues in other uh parts of Greece that uh adult neurologists or colleagues as we have done in the past in order to give patients with red eye Ataxia uh the best possible clinical care from a very high scientific point of view thank you very much thank you thank you thank you professor and thank you for showcasing uh exactly the capabilities that we have and it is very important for our patients to understand uh that throughout uh Greece even though it&amp;#39;s a small country it has been a substantive network of key experts and key expert senders for their trade men and this is something that it is uh uh it is uh it is uh very well established over the years and we are very happy that we cooperate with you so I will move on to uh to uh Professor jorgo scotsies who actually is the professor a professor in neurology and neurogenetics at the United Hospital in Athens which actually is the European Network reference Network for uh rare neuromuscular diseases and he is part of uh of the effects also study so we heard earlier this day from Dr York shoes about the effects and the work that we have done uh Professor could say thank you for being with us and uh showing what we are doing there in a unit thank you thank you very much it&amp;#39;s an honor for me to be speaking here um were it not for the for for the elections um I would I would be there with you um so I&amp;#39;m very glad you invited me I will share again because short talk um for you while I so I I hope now this is visible um because as as mentioned previously this is a an attacks yeah meeting and not just the friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia I will give you some data from Greece some numbers regarding both free drugs Ataxia and and other repeat expansion attacks that we&amp;#39;ve been studying for several years in Athens um I want to say that um I have co-headed along with the professor yuriakaradima for the past six years now the neurogenetics unit at the first Department of Neurology um in the University of Athens the Unity Hospital so I will talk a bit about uh who we are and give you some numbers concerning the patients we see but your year will take tell you a lot more about the laboratory side of things and what kind of tests we&amp;#39;ve done all these years and then I will give you some data the sort of thing we have collected over the years regarding free drugs and some other repeat expansion taxes in Greece so the neurogenetics unit and Athens is quite unique in Greek terms it was um it was uh founded in the early 90s by Professor vasilopoulos who in the area of neurogenetics has been a great leader in Greece and was a teacher of all of us um the vision is that it combines a very specialized outpatients neurogenetics Clinic with a neurogenetics laboratory and that brings uh patience and and investigations together and helps us reach final molecular diagnosis and more patients and then take it from there towards genetic counseling follow-up and treatment the unit has been strengthened considerably by being part of of the first Department of Neurology which is um part of the Ern RND Network there for now participates in the attacks and HSP disease groups or vrn RND but it&amp;#39;s also been very important for us that we&amp;#39;ve been part of effects for the last five years now and I think that should be also um note um from my point of view I had the Pinnacle side of things so we&amp;#39;ve been running in your genetics clinic now for many years um just to give you the date of the last 10 years um we have seen over 4 000 patients and regarding a taxes um about 12 to 13 percent of our workload concerns ataxias so um we&amp;#39;re not pure a taxi experts I don&amp;#39;t think in Greece one could say that there are neurologists that are so focused on Ataxia but as a substantial amount of our work and our interest is devoted to our tax years but we examine these patients we follow them up we we score them with Sarah&amp;#39;s cause if they are parts of effects they are studied in much more detail by my colleague Dr Kanye who is I think the only person from our group that has actually uh is with you there and can talk to you more about um this side of things um I just want to show you a map because the neurogenetics unit is is quite unique in its characteristics um in within the Greek public sector we have more or less diagnosed patients with free drugs Ataxia since 1997 and I think most of our colleagues in Greece refer at least for molecular diagnosis their cases to the unit so you can see an overview of all the patients that have been diagnosed in the units in the last over 25 years um the the it&amp;#39;s a 117 patients in total in you can see the geographical distribution it shows that it&amp;#39;s widespread there are families with free drugs all over Greece and um it&amp;#39;s definitely from how to view the most commonly uh diagnosed hereditary Ataxia we don&amp;#39;t follow up of course all of these patients A lot of these patients are followed up systematically now the centers like Thessaloniki Professor kimiskidis by pediatric neurologist Professor do not open los Prof but we do often diagnose them and we have an overview we follow quite a lot of patients in Athens because of effects also and we have entered 32 patients into effects and follow them at least once a year so we&amp;#39;ve looked into the genetic epidemiology of free drugs some years back there might be some areas in the Aegean which have clusters of the disease um and and some islands such as icaria or Milos we found had more cases uh than expected but the overall prevalence according based on our date is around one in a hundred thousand patients which is a bit less than some Western European countries but still significant when we look at our cohort we see that if we focus on early on City Ataxia or uh recessive attacks also affected siblings around 50 percent of our cases and this is from a series of 192 index cases seen over 24 years are free drugs attacks yeah and of course we have uh we have a picture of these patients at presentation even though we only follow a a a a minority of them regularly and you can see that in terms of sex ratio they are um equally divided um their agent presentation is is around 25 years so the there is diagnostic delay there the age of tonset in our code the mean nature at answered is around 15 years of age and we have 15 patients around 12 which have a late onset and milder disease you can see here data from our effects uh cohort 13 patients have been followed up for at least three years and you can see the rate of change of the Sarah score just to make a point of how these patients are properly um characterized Within um the the eFax Consortium um I have a few things to say regarding other repeat expansionary taxes which we have been systematically diagnosing at least for the last 12 years um so the scars um fragile X Tremor Ataxia syndrome and canvas a more recent addition and you can see in the map on the left um there is a distribution in the patients we&amp;#39;ve diagnosed less so than in free drugs I&amp;#39;m not so sure that we are receiving perhaps as many referrals as as we could have for these eight taxes um you can see that these are much rarer diseases in total all these patients are 37 diagnosed cases that come 131 families and this is shown that here in a bit more detail um Greece primarily has scar once KATU and Scar 7 regarding the classic scars scar 3 mashado Joseph&amp;#39;s disease and scarcitys is ex very very rare but this new repeat expansion attacks yeah canvas that you all know about is actually quite common especially if you look for it in the right group of people so scar panel we do hundreds of these and and you&amp;#39;re here we&amp;#39;ll tell you more about this and the hit rate is is around four percent but not more whereas in canvas if you screen late on Saturday tax yes you have a hit rate that is about 10 percent and if these patients have the the full Triad you know of canvas the hit rate is very high um so of course over the years um the unit has published several papers on on repeat expansionary taxes on free drugs and now we&amp;#39;re doing more work of course with NGS as well I think this is important um because this was a really relatively undeveloped field in Greece when I was starting at the unit um and uh of course joining eFax being part of vrn R D um and uh supporting the Greek Ataxia patient groups all these things are very important so let me just conclude um by saying that the neurogenetics unit or the Unity Hospital has focused important clinical Education and Research work on Greek Ataxia patients and over the years we have established a significant Greek hereditary attacks a registry that of course can get better and and more complete um we our work is strengthened by the being part of eFax and ER and RND our data showed freedrax a taxi of course is the most common hereditary attacks in Greece with a widespread distribution other repeat expansionary taxes seem substantially less common with a possible exception of canvas if you look for it in selected late onset cohorts and of course we are very happy that this networking for a taxi specialist is happening and we want to work closer with all our colleagues around Greece I think Greece is is mature to move on to the next level of caring for these patients and we want to continue working close with the the Hellenic Ataxia Association and again thank you very very much for the invitation thank you thank you Professor kusis because uh it&amp;#39;s a it was a very a very uh detailed and very uh presentation that shows exactly what&amp;#39;s the situation here in the country and of course I could Echo all your conclusions in terms of the need for patient Registries as we are getting closer and closer to treatments our next speaker and thank you for being here with us uh obviously you you are from the close by area and the elections have not be a problem and I presenter here is the Nobles who is an associate professor in pediatric neurology at article Hospital in Athens he works with uh with our patients in a very big hospital and since who is supposed to to to present at the beginning where it&amp;#39;s not capable of join you will present the whole capabilities of article then okay the floor is yours um thank you very much for the invitation and I&amp;#39;m glad I&amp;#39;m here the elections brought me closer to you so um I&amp;#39;m gonna present you uh actually I&amp;#39;m gonna move into the clinical grounds because uh I don&amp;#39;t want to present our capabilities it&amp;#39;s pretty much the same as the previous one and we&amp;#39;ll collaborate all together but um I choose this title uh urgent unmet need for friedrich&amp;#39;s attacks a patient and by urgent I&amp;#39;m also give a Time flavor a Time parameter because the time concept is different is different for the patients indifferent for the caregivers is different for the scientist a different for the clinician and it&amp;#39;s different for the industry um as a clinician I&amp;#39;m closer to the patient so my thoughts reflect mainly patience thoughts I&amp;#39;m gonna present cases and uh just give um our worries uh from cases and I present a Maria who is a very beautiful girl uh born on 2011 at age of six she started having some running difficulties some fatigue clumsiness nothing very important but that uh but at the age of seven She developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy uh we saw that girl at seven and a half uh she had the sensory Ataxia and absent reflexes so the diagnosis was pretty obvious the genetic test was done and uh she had she has Friedrich Ataxia um and then we did have some evidence about medication because we have to provide something to our patients the evidence is it was not that robust but as Professor zafiri has mentioned before we need to do something so we placed here on a debenham so she started taking a debenham and she was pretty stable in a debenham and as you can see with on the Sarah test and uh Sarah test icars and the uh the first test she is even a little better so we&amp;#39;re pretty happy with that but still we&amp;#39;re worried now we have Maria like just before the diagnosis and uh trying to do the tandem walking and the two and a half years after treatment she&amp;#39;s still doing pretty well she&amp;#39;s happy but she&amp;#39;s struggling a lot and definitely she needs something better then I&amp;#39;m going to present some other cases uh and that&amp;#39;s Christian and Mateo two brothers and we start with Christians that he has a peculiar diagnostic Odyssey just before the diagnosis uh actually he was diagnosed initially with uh cardiomyopathy he even had a cardiac biopsy and then develop some clumsiness and steady walking Falls that brought him to a developmental pediatrician and then to a child neurology and the diagnosis was made at that time and [Music] his cardiomyopathy was quite substantial he got treatment for that and he was placed again on a debenham and then we wanted to and as you can see uh the Sarah test was um uh not uh improved substantially but actually you can see some decline on his motor abilities by that&amp;#39;s going up but that means the higher score is worse so we see the Sarah test and like icar test is getting worse here is the first test that still is getting worse though so I depend on it&amp;#39;s not working and we had with this guy because his brother was younger age and we saw him just after the diagnosis even without any symptoms and we had the opportunity at that time to see if we could prevent this boy for cardiomyopathy for um or for motor decline since we have a patient that we can treat him early we start I dipping on right after the diagnosis without cardiomyopathy but guess what he was pretty stable but at one year later he developed cardiomyopathy and his cardiomyopathy get got even worse so we failed to prevent the the disease even we treat him very early so that&amp;#39;s to me is a failure is a failure because um nowadays in all these neurodegenerative disease we want to treat them early before the new the generation and here we had no luck and we hear the Saras tests and the first test and uh this is Mateo a diagnosis we see him that time them walking that&amp;#39;s a diagnosis and then two years later he&amp;#39;s still ambulatory he&amp;#39;s walking but he stuck them book is not he&amp;#39;s not able to do tandem walk um and that&amp;#39;s actually a it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very uh sad for us to see that progression of the disease and always were looking for a light always we are looking for something new something to maybe to stabilize and even make this patient better and we do have now some evidence about other treatments alone and still I mean the data is not that robust but uh uh it&amp;#39;s something that we want to to try but the age the age the age of we can use this medication only because the study was done a patient between 16 and 40 years of age so um there is a limitation here this is a limitation that uh it&amp;#39;s very difficult for the patients for the doctors to wait until 16 years of age to keep going with the neurodegeneration to keep going with the cardiomyopathy and weight and until 16 years of age to try this medication um I hope to have more robust Data before the age of 16 because a pediatric neurologist so we can have this tool this weapon in our Armature and I want to acknowledge our pediatric neurology department we are we have a neurogenetic clinic we follow six patients with a fried auction a lot of other patients with neurogenetic disorders and we collaborate collaborate with all other departments we try to evolve into trials and into the registry thank you very much foreign opoulos because you showed us the perspective of the of the clinician uh on the early ages of our children this is very important because uh it is uh we as parents when we start this journey we need to have uh to build on on on Hope and to build on uh on the idea that that this disease or any Ataxia disease at some point in time may be treatable and the earliest this approach this intervention the earliest this intervention comes into play the early the better the effect and the better the results will be to the patient so thank you for sharing this and uh for all the work that you are doing at article Hospital uh uh our last speaker for the this Greek panel is our professor yoria karadima who is actually is the co-director with uh Dr kutsis at the unit of neurodegenetic uh testing and neurodic diseases in a you need your hospital who is actually with us today sees there at the at the unit and performs all the all the all the Cooperative tests with our patients thank you krisha for being here with us and professor karadima she will present us the capabilities that they have in terms of diagnosis our patients and not only for the patients but also for the families thank you Professor thanks a lot hereditary attacks Association for the kindly introduction their members of the present Conference of the Euro Ataxia good evening I hope you have a very nice attendance of the conference today are put to the Greek mountains I hope that I would like to be with you but because of the elections I can&amp;#39;t I hope another time I&amp;#39;ll be there with you so these are my disclosures in the following 10 minutes I am going to present you the neurogenetics laboratory of the national and capitalistian University of Athens that is situated in the initial hospital I&amp;#39;m going to give you some information about the genetic diagnosis that carried out in our laboratory since 1997 the quality of our tests and at the end I&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about our activities for research education and clinical care so uh uh as my colleague as my dear calling uh Professor kuchis has already mentioned it the neurogenetics unit of a Unity on hospital is consisted of two parts the neurogenetic outpassing clinic and then neurogenetic laboratory the neurogenetic Unicity of its goals through the close collaboration of this distinct but either wine Services which strive towards the establishment of a final diagnosis and the provision of comprehensive genetic counseling the laboratory has clinical and scientific expertise in inherited neurological disorders and has systematically provided molecular diagnostic services at the national level since 1995 performing over of 80 000 genetic tests for patients with suspected neurogenetic disorders the lab is structured according to the international guidelines and design with the necessary technological infrastructure for the study of DNA such as as you can see in the present slide automated nuclear tested extractor thermal cyclers Imaging Imaging system for gel documentation genetic analyzer and most recently very lately a genetic analyzer for the next for the operation of Next Generation sequencing our neurogenetics lab employs molecular biology techniques like a Sanger sequencing fragment analysis repeat Prime PCR mlpa collection sequencing it follows uh it follows external and internal equality controls periodically by the European molecular quality Network and quality control and the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and genetics respectively the laboratory also follows a specific quality control manual and we assume that it will be accredited successfully for the International Organization for standardization ISO 151.89 by the critic accreditation system exceed by the end of 2023. more specifically more specifically we started the investigation of the molecular investigation of the hereditary ataxias in 1990 in 1997 with the establishment of molecular protocols for the investigation of fried rice Ataxia we continued in 2012 with the investigation of the major spinal cerebellum taxes like scan 1 2 3 6 and 7. in 2015 we established the molecular protocols for the investigation of of Scar 17 in 2019 forsca 36 2020 for FX tasks and 2021 for cannabis last year we started investigating all all the other taxes for point mutation using the the new generation sequencing analysis until now we have the largest clinically characterized cohorts of patients with hereditary ataxias at the national level as for the genetic test more specifically over 1 400 DNA tests have been operated for hereditary taxes in our lab since 1997. as you can see we have done 682 tests for free dehataxia 456 Force car panels compromised one two three six and seven Spanish uh 92 forska 36 93 for FX does 99 for kanban 6 16 for Scott 17. so it&amp;#39;s worth to mention that we are the the only uh we are the only lab which operate in the public sector Goods operate genetic testing for hereditary ataxias in our lab there is a bio storage of DNA samples from more than 1 000 patients all over Greece so a about our actions as it has been already mentioned uh by my colleague my dear calling professional coaches the past he has some critical papers about hereditary taxes have been published in international journals by the scientific stuff our projects in in what is as applied research understanding area taxes and insisting interaction our research activities mainly for the University of Athens we are a sender of expertise in neurological rare diseases for Greece and for the European Union we are also members of the European freedrax attacks a Consortium for translation studies effects our educational activities include other graduates and postgraduate teaching and message dissertation presentation and talk for saying different conferences and bad things associations as you can see we are a unique and relatively small Hub but as you know not challenge is too big if you have the right team all the members of our unit work hard and do their best for the study of patience with hereditary ataxias we believe that we have much more to offer in achieving positive scientific knowledge the formulation of guidelines at the best service for patients with a great joy that finally the approval of the first drug for the most common Ataxia is a fact we are going to stand by the Helen free breaks a taxi Association aside every time it is needed thank you all for your attention thank you Professor thank you all thank you for the panel uh professor kimis kidis professor Kurtis professor zafirio professor dinoplos and Professor karadima thank you for because you showed exactly what we can offer to our patients and as an holistic basis approach and this is very important for the families and the patients uh I think that we have exceeded our time and we will move on to the next session very quickly thank you",

    "transcript": "hey guys it&amp;#39;s another wonderful episode or at least we hope so and I hope everybody&amp;#39;s doing well how are you doing Natalie after the car wreck happy Sunday I&amp;#39;m still a little bit sore but I&amp;#39;m right yep so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s another weekend day so that means the kids are home so you probably hear them in the background for background noise and hopefully they don&amp;#39;t bust out and we have to cancel this video or something but um just like that so what&amp;#39;s today&amp;#39;s topic we&amp;#39;re going to talk about the impacts of disabilities well let me clarify that physical disabilities or being in a wheelchair have on your social life so so severe physical disabilities that you know make it hard to like walk up a step or get up multiple steps yes in showers we can even say you know if a restaurant or whatever isn&amp;#39;t accommodated or the doorways are not wide enough and just be kind of allinclusive so this isn&amp;#39;t you know kind of a Frederick taxia video but also inclusive of other physical disabilities that you know sometimes lead you to being in a wheelchair yes so all do you feel like you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;ve been included or excluded and what part of your disability was like the uh the Tipping Point where it went from great to not so great I think when the F became more prominent I was I started being Lov out of social events like probably senior year of high school early 20 so like I um had a friend that got married at like 22 or 23 and we had gone to a French house down in Orlando because they had better access like BR shops to shop for like her wedding got and stuff and my friends had to help me to the toilet not like once I was on the toilet but like get there to go to the bathroom and then like I had to have them kind of put me inside the bathtub and and that&amp;#39;s how shower was on the floor so I did it made things to PO and I&amp;#39;m sure became important to them even though they&amp;#39;re like oh no no no because then when it came to planning um friends bachelorette party they&amp;#39;re like look we don&amp;#39;t think you need to go because we&amp;#39;re all going to get drunk and we don&amp;#39;t need to be helping or be the one responsible yeah responsible to take care of you that was the just I need say I trust to disolve those friendships I&amp;#39;ve kind of always felt like well you either accept all of me or you don&amp;#39;t deserve to get any of me kind of thing I can be a flat out with I think like I Jam will tell you I&amp;#39;m highly you needed and what what was the term I used when we met you were to uh something intense intense she can go from this docile kind of shy reserved creature to like a face it&amp;#39;s turned around and yes it&amp;#39;s you can feel high intensity especially when it comes to my disil because do not all of who I am might want to be looked at like that but at the same time it&amp;#39;s a big part of who I am so take it ear leaveit I don&amp;#39;t really care it&amp;#39;s not hurt me way well well my experience things like that do get they touch a nerve with you and in my own experience what you talked you mean people either hurt you or they make you angry you know and or at least you come off your hurt and you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re angry because you&amp;#39;re hurt or you know what I&amp;#39;m saying what how would you say that oh yeah B because a like I had one therapist tell me that I was an iceberg of anger and your anger is on the outside above the water level but you&amp;#39;re really acting out because they hurt is it kind of like a defense mechanism so instead of crying and saying everybody&amp;#39;s hurting my feelings you&amp;#39;re saying I&amp;#39;m angry I&amp;#39;m going to kill you or whatever it is let me run over you whatever it is I don&amp;#39;t know let me quit answering your phone calls or did they call you afterwards after the wedding I don&amp;#39;t remember exactly what happened since so many years yeah and uh you know just knowing what I know and I&amp;#39;m sure knowing what you know people were excited about their wedding and it it probably they felt like your disability was a hindrance to them doing it in some way whether or not whether or not they meant to hurt your feelings they obviously did because you were like best friends with these people right they were your best two friends or something or so child and you already said you were walking at that time a little bit right but getting up like two or three steps would have been hard or or impossible without help yeah it just had like more balance and getting in a tub with a big lip was impossible without help so you couldn&amp;#39;t bathe if you went on vacation you either had to have help with bathing or you didn&amp;#39;t bathe at all yes like it kind of be like now you like you just prepare like you don&amp;#39;t go stay at someone El and just think you&amp;#39;re going to be whatever like my in house I had this experience with the two when I was younger like her she lived at a um town house and I eventually got to where I could to go up steps you know so just stay there with SK bu but she moved moved and as able to get in areas but again I still had that like my sister like help me on to the toilet and I kind of thing but like now like I wanted do that I know if I were going down south I like in the hotel room lips com like you just kind of got a got to plan differently and and when you first came to this house you could get through the main entrance barely and you could get to the master bedroom just barely barely but when it comes to getting into the children&amp;#39;s where the children&amp;#39;s bedrooms would be you could not do it on your own so when she first came to look to kind of hang hang out look at the house and all me and my mother helped her get through the one of the bedrooms and kind of had some pictures and all I was pregnant and him and his mom carried me yeah we had to basically stop the wheelchair at the doorway and then carry her to the bed in there we we you know this was right after the first uh or only baby shower right so you you hanging out with your baby shower this is where we were uh storing the baby shower items before she moved here um so there there were challenges even where she&amp;#39;s at you know there still are challenges and there will continue to be more as you know her neuro disease neuromuscular disease gets worse but people that live in a mobile home I mean there&amp;#39;s almost no way for her to get in because they always have steps and but one Thanksgiving you want to we went to his cousin&amp;#39;s house and his cousin lives in a m home very nice m home and it has like six or so steps right it&amp;#39;s like 4 foot off the ground or something I not Dar um yeah as like a few steps and we got me in in my manual chair with the help of Dan&amp;#39;s Uncle so like Dan and his uncle lived in the entire wheeler up and that&amp;#39;s how I got it but like if there&amp;#39;s not another man there like someone we can physically live and we we&amp;#39;ve sort of graduated from the manual wheelchair thing and but there was a time when that that might have worked over over having a three four 500 lb whatever wheelchair yeah but but like now our thanksgivings are typically at your mom&amp;#39;s or like here or or outside somewhere came here yeah we went to his step brother my time way we had have it outside which brings up another issue the bathroom yeah if you&amp;#39;re an hour and a half two hours away and there&amp;#39;s Boonies and Forest and no was it was right there by what&amp;#39;s that is that the Oola forest or is that something else okay so yeah basically right outside the the state forest which goes into Georgia and stuff and there is no businesses around there there&amp;#39;s no place to use the bathroom unless you just somebody carried you and the everything is dirt roads everything is mud you know basically and it would be hard to get her especially in a heavy electric chair to get to a porch or anything to get to the bathroom and then she would have to be helped majorly helped so outside thanksgivings outside Christmas parties you know it could be cold it could be rainy you know and um that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not always always a option an option and so although I&amp;#39;ve TR myself to hold by my bathroom which probably isn&amp;#39;t really good in the long run but if I&amp;#39;m somewhere I can&amp;#39;t really get to a restroom I can typically hold so but other than that like people people and here&amp;#39;s the thing a lot of people in wheelchairs selfa and people may wonder if you do that and I&amp;#39;m not experienced enough to do it if I could do it safely it would probably save us a lot of a lot of stress but and she can&amp;#39;t do it or she I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;d want to try but so that brings up another thing like you had somebody like what was it a Halloween party at arts and medicine or something yes uh friend SL coworker on a Halloween party a few years back and I was already in this chair jous I was in this chair and she did not invite me to her Halloween party but before she had it she came to me and said oh I didn&amp;#39;t invite you because there&amp;#39;s like a 5 in lip on my doorway so I don&amp;#39;t know how we would have got you into my house and five in isn&amp;#39;t bad if you&amp;#39;re in a manual chair but somebody&amp;#39;s going to have to take responsibility for you you know if you fall on their their property and she&amp;#39;s pushing you in Marcy you know her friend had like a 5 in gap on or lip on hers and um no problem as long as we were in the light is aluminum uh Quicky or whatever ever wheelchair so now we have used that you know on higher steps and it can be dangerous you could you know we could tumble to the side down forward or anything like that but you know if you got two May three people it&amp;#39;s doable no matter what the steps are um so that brings up another Point how much of it is hoopla versus you know like how much of of it is a stigma why don&amp;#39;t people invite you maybe over um is there a stigma with wheelchair people I&amp;#39;m sure there is yes I mean there are a lot of stigmas but let&amp;#39;s get focused just on you being able to get to somebody&amp;#39;s house get inside their house be able to get under a table to you know dining room table or whatever to eat all this stuff go to the bathroom do you do you ever feel like someone in particular did not invite you based on false information or false uh what is it the stigma yes many times um for instance all of my high school friends like we well as far as far back as M like I read a mon High School Middle School um Early College like Yan Fest year it&amp;#39;s ridiculous oh um we always ran in the same group and um again these are the same group of friends that I had the issue with at the wedding but this was before the wedding every summer they went on a CR and almost every every time we got together which quite often like just at parties or what they would talk about going on what they were going to do and who they were going to see and all this stuff and one time remember where I turned in and my uncle at the time worked for Cru lines who was one of their Engineers so just chiming in us oh yeah my uncle could probably get all discounts and I remember the room just went like dead like you her pin drop and one of my friends and I Loosely and she was the friend in the was always real bold and kind of looked at me like I was insane so I just felt weird like ever since then and I&amp;#39;ve had other issues like I but again I think after that is kind of where I the back boat you either accept me or you don&amp;#39;t like that&amp;#39;s your problem by I&amp;#39;ll find friends who will carry me on the Max and take me anywh I need to go so yeah that&amp;#39;s another point I think we talked about before doing this video was there&amp;#39;s some of Natalie&amp;#39;s best friends or friend her family and we talked about this woman on the uh what was it our claim Fame part two or whatever video um BJ which was you know Mar Solis the the family first family of jazz um um um they kind of a black family African-American family they kind of treated her how do they treat you a lot better than most white people yeah exactly and I&amp;#39;m actually had this discussion on tape for one of my sociology classes I&amp;#39;ve always felt more respected being like a matriarch archal issue or like be that I have a disability I&amp;#39;ve always gotten more respect from African amans or like even other races like I remember like going through Santa Fe on crutches because that&amp;#39;s when I used to use crutches Santa Fe College Community College yes like black guys would always like all doors open for me like we&amp;#39;re always extremely polite like 95% of my time like my guys would just walk through the doorway shut the door my face like not twice about like I could what was that doctor that did that the you know a couple months ago at North Florida wasn&amp;#39;t was he white uh no oh at the ER yeah yeah that was a white guy like Daddy yeah like I was rolling by the door and he just F and then basically like go hit me in the with [Music] door so I&amp;#39;ve just always felt that people like differentes and cultures cultures and all that stuff backgrounds belief systems are more open-minded than just to openminded do my disability like it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not a disability like a hindrance you know like it&amp;#39;s just part of my I am okay you T me or you can leave me like and and like BJ&amp;#39;s family they weren&amp;#39;t going to see somebody that&amp;#39;s just because you&amp;#39;re in a wheelchair that you shouldn&amp;#39;t have have fun and enjoy your time with them when they&amp;#39;re having cookouts and parties and stuff like that they made sure you were involved and that you were happy and this is I&amp;#39;ve heard BJ say this before you know you&amp;#39;re when you&amp;#39;re around here you&amp;#39;re a family yeah and and there there is no stranger there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no white and black you know there&amp;#39;s just your family and we&amp;#39;re going to accept you and we&amp;#39;re going to make sure when you leave our part our you know cookout or whatever we&amp;#39;re going to feed you until you&amp;#39;re ready to throw up all that stuff happy and full and yeah yeah and maybe you&amp;#39;ll do a little bit of dancing before you go home you know so anything else you want to touch on here or do you think we got everything no I think we covered it pretty good so yes sir for sure is a stigma that balls her out being disabled or in the whech how do you avoid that St again I&amp;#39;m I gr a backb you take me as I am or you leave me and part of part of like I said is it hoop or whatever is people would I&amp;#39;m assuming this is what they&amp;#39;re thinking as somebody that is mostly abl bodied that do I have to accommodate you to get you to come to my house or whatever and they may not realize that Natalie or somebody else has a little bit of Independence they may not think that you know like me I I careg from Natalie they&amp;#39;re not going to take her to the bathroom or anything like that um I&amp;#39;m not saying I wouldn&amp;#39;t accept help from my family that that&amp;#39;s close to to go to a toilet that doesn&amp;#39;t have bars on it or something but you know as long as she can get through those doorways and get up into the house just just invite somebody don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t intentionally not invite somebody just because they have a bad handicap or they&amp;#39;re in a wheelchair yeah that hurts and not everyone is going to like SLP it off and don&amp;#39;t really care about it like it does hurt yeah as I said it&amp;#39;s just because you think you have to accommodate somebody it is somebody else&amp;#39;s responsibility if not the person in the wheelchair to make sure they have their needs met so you know yes like this video like thumbs up

    "transcript": "hey guys good morning yeah it&amp;#39;s been a a while and um it is 57 degrees outside it was foggy this morning with a low I think of 47 and I think in about two night two nights from now we&amp;#39;re going to get back into the 30s again that&amp;#39;s kind of like our third phase in the 30s and lower we we hit what 28 or 29 a couple weeks back so we got a you know one little hard freeze and a couple little frog and I think some people in this area a few days ago said they hit like 30.1 or something so I don&amp;#39;t think it hit anywhere near that here maybe we&amp;#39;re in a different microclimate so we&amp;#39;re at 82 subscribers today yay so we we don&amp;#39;t know when this video is going to be uploaded there we have a video we&amp;#39;ve been trying to upload for about a week or more and it aired out a few times and it&amp;#39;s at about 74 75% if it doesn&amp;#39;t airror out maybe tonight or tomorrow morning that video will be online although we&amp;#39;re going to be reviewing it it&amp;#39;s got some sensitive content make sure everybody&amp;#39;s on board with it because so it may not even come out we still have another Talk video behind that that we haven&amp;#39;t even attempted to upload yet remember we got terrible internet are we looking into any ways of trying to fix our internet issues our uploading issues sort of yes I hope so there are two options and I don&amp;#39;t know if which one&amp;#39;s for us if any so T-Mobile has a 5G hotspot you know that they sell supposedly unlimited for 50 bucks a month and when we look online at uh the service area it says you know they don&amp;#39;t service our area but I&amp;#39;ve heard people say that if you go to the store they&amp;#39;ll sell you this 5G hotspot and it&amp;#39;s worked for several people they say they stream four five you know like video games and Netflix and all that stuff but who knows how it works until you know you try it so that is probably the cheapest option and the other option is starlake which is probably $600 $700 up front start and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not the cheapest internet we have fiber lines just a couple hundred feet from us but we can&amp;#39;t access them cuz they&amp;#39;re going to other places they&amp;#39;re servicing cell phone towers but it&amp;#39;s our internet and phone service that is doing it why can&amp;#39;t they put them down these little side roads and give it to us gigabit you know sucks just just a little and DSL I guess you know every foot you&amp;#39;re away from the main Hub or service port or whatever you call it you lose speed you lose stability you you know added line noise or whatever and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not a good service it&amp;#39;s better than dialup uh when we first got Broadband here you know before Natalie came I think it was 1.5 megabit connections which is yeah we couldn&amp;#39;t do that now I mean we wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to watch Netflix or anything YouTube we had uh you know just may be like online MP3s or something you know where you stream these streaming music things but nothing nothing like uh we&amp;#39;re at 30 megabits per second it&amp;#39;s not a consistent good upload so we we have to look at Alternatives you know and and if our internet provider doesn&amp;#39;t provide us with this gigabit which they&amp;#39;ve been promising for years the fiber you know fiber optic uh internet then we have to try to find something else so what&amp;#39;s today&amp;#39;s topic of discussion raising kids with Frederick taxia which is in AO so I just going off of my own experience Let&amp;#39;s Pretend nobody know has ever seen your channel and no one knows what that you&amp;#39;re in a wheelchair that you have uh this what is fa short I think it&amp;#39;s kind obv the wheelchair but yeah people click on our videos you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s because YouTube I guess suggests videos for different content to different people some people will you know click on it and uh and we&amp;#39;ve had some like dislikes and comments that were kind of rude but it&amp;#39;s probably because they do not have the full story they&amp;#39;re not looking at all of our content all so so fa is a neuromuscular disease similar to muscular distrophy or or multiple multiple SC sclerosis I got it close enough I guess Ms and you it usually progresses fairly slow you know over a period of years so you might walk you might run you might drive a vehicle and then you slowly lose those abilities so which is exactly how my NE progressed yeah so raising kids with fa it is before you go though before you say it this this is probably going to be an ongoing discussion throughout the years cuz our kids are only what five five to two and a half so so we have many years of discussions about raising kids with fa but let&amp;#39;s go for right now what is your experiences it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s hard it&amp;#39;s very hard I&amp;#39;m going to let you take the lead and I&amp;#39;m going to try not to talk anymore because you you really need to uh explain this cuz this is mostly your emotions your uh desires wants you as a mom or whatever so take it away okay so as a mama you do everything for your kids basically oh that&amp;#39;s my experience of what what a mama should be because of my mom that&amp;#39;s my mom was so and you Nur her like nurturing is a huge part and I&amp;#39;m very nurturing I would say um so it&amp;#39;s been very hard for me to kind of sit back and watch Dan do all the stuff that I think Mama should be doing like my definition of your definition M should be yeah diapers yeah so like changing diapers like we&amp;#39;ve kind of videotaped it DED to have them oh I think I found it a few months ago we would have to this would kind of be a good place to introduce that video I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any any way we can put that video on this one because we&amp;#39;d have to dig so far and spend so much time doing it but we&amp;#39;ll do another video maybe of you getting yes so like when they were in diapers it was I when I grew up I grew up basically my entire life so I&amp;#39;ve changed so many diap time funny but when we had our kids I&amp;#39;ve lost the ability to use my hands really to change the diaper like my hands work but they don&amp;#39;t work perfectly so that&amp;#39;s something I struggled with which I&amp;#39;m sure most everyone is like who cares here is like I would give anything not change diapers but I would give anything to change [Music] diaper um you want to put put in it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like uh there&amp;#39;s a word for it you know just you said you know when we were at PT or whatever you told the the guy s that you know you what&amp;#39;s the term you used you don&amp;#39;t know how easy things were until you you know have to do them you can&amp;#39;t do them but there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a word for that I guess a better word or or statement I can&amp;#39;t think of it right now though but like you would say that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re were afraid to when I said like you don&amp;#39;t realize yeah that some somebody does all the time yeah like how much work goes into changing a diaper like you know when they were little I could lift their butts and even though I couldn&amp;#39;t like stick the tape onto the front of the diaper or whatever like I had still lift them as they got older I could I can&amp;#39;t even lift them up like left their BS up well that&amp;#39;s a huge part CH dier is lifting their M up and like even to this day like the older two were now party trained but like Junior the other day had pooping and you were outside and we couldn&amp;#39;t get you and I said do I need to come up your butt and he was like it&amp;#39;s not not funny but it is just the way when you say it it&amp;#39;s funny but the actual yeah but he was like the M thing is there so you can&amp;#39;t get to be you can&amp;#39;t even get to there try but but both kids if they really wanted you to wipe their butt they would walk out towards you and bring you a napkin or you know toilet paper and they&amp;#39;ve done that to me when I that&amp;#39;s true they like just don&amp;#39;t like bming shouldn&amp;#39;t wipe their butt which is weird it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s a struggle for you if you wipe their butt going and go washing your hands people don&amp;#39;t know how hard it is for you to do it how long it takes to go set up the sink and wash your hands right like our sink is not something I just get do even though we&amp;#39;ve already had it readjusted we still have to readjust them which is taking forever but all the so just things like that are like them Shing every night like I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m a retive about it I don&amp;#39;t mind saying it but they&amp;#39;ve been in school playing their germs everywhere like they have to shower at night when they come home and we arguments all the time over this but to me that&amp;#39;s very very important and even that like I can&amp;#39;t go just turn under water I mean I they can turn their own water on now which makes it easier for both of us but there you know 6 months ago eight months ago we I would come home worn out tired or whatever and it&amp;#39;s like I just want to go lay down I can&amp;#39;t do it though because I have so many responsibilities but yeah I kind of would back talk a little bit and say can we just skip the bass tonight so these are things like that are have been a huge copyright like and raising kids with thata and like between our relationship because these are things I know that I should be responsibly doing as the Mommy it&amp;#39;s kind of a m job to hear the kids but I can&amp;#39;t do all of it I mean brushing their teeth they do a fairly good job on it now are older but and they they they all three of them climb on your chair now if they want on your lap or in the bed you don&amp;#39;t have to pick them up yeah but I don&amp;#39;t have the what do you call it core coordination oh coordination to brush their teeth even though like they all three like I&amp;#39;m insistent upon them having uh battery operated toothbrushes just for the reason of I know that you get a better clean with a battery upper F you do a manual so for the reason I know that I can&amp;#39;t physically sit there and brush their teeth daddy didn&amp;#39;t really need to do that like he did when they were younger but now he doesn&amp;#39;t need to do that on to of everything else he does um and with all three of them I have been pretty much insistent about nursing because that was one thing the physical aspect that I could do I could nurse iers their oldest I was two second or M child JJ of 14 months and then Jonathan I had a little trouble with because they gave me a birth andol shot and dried my milk up so I could have L there s four months but I still and that was like a bonding thing between all of us too like they look to me for food now Jonathan has daddy&amp;#39;s boy yeah toally daddy&amp;#39;s boy like only recently because now he&amp;#39;s like two and a half almost three has he started like showing mommy affection and like actually coming to Mommy if he has Boo Boo or that kind of thing like he now is Discerning the difference but just like it&amp;#39;s very hard very very hard toyless you have to do everything like I don&amp;#39;t I almost feel like an older sister like a a child yourself right like a lot of times I feel like their older not their mom and and this is an issue probably with anybody any interabled or interabled with kids or I guess in some circumstances some some people that in that aren&amp;#39;t rich or whatever in your condition or your uh whatever status if they&amp;#39;re like in the UK or something they would have like uh care provided a care team for the kids a care team for you it doesn&amp;#39;t happen here so uh kids knock they put a lot of things on the floor especially in the room and all it takes is one object to block your wheelchair from not being able to go hang out with them or supervise them or whatever so how let&amp;#39;s try to tackle as many issues as as you&amp;#39;ve experienced concerns issues emotions um how big of an issue is things being in your way for your wheelchair and you not been a to pick it up I can&amp;#39;t again if they&amp;#39;ve put stuff all over the floor and they&amp;#39;re in the bathroom and let&amp;#39;s think of it as like a safety issue like they tear the hot water up too high well I can&amp;#39;t get in there like that&amp;#39;s huge for me it kind of blocks me out of that part of of their lives like is being a protector and a supervisor or whatever I mean then it and and okay so next is you know do they listen to Mama when you know not at all yeah this goes back to you saying you feel like a sister right versus a mom yeah uh they don&amp;#39;t they to be clear they hardly ever listen to me either but but they they treat you slightly different but they know that you can get to them and you can you know punish them whether it just be a threat or not they know you can do it yeah like to where I can grab them and put them in a Timeout or whatever and yeah to be like all they got to do is say hi but yeah Mama and JJ the middle son is the worst is what you call worst behaved of the bunch for both of us and he does he he hits you right if oh he hit me the other SP out me and he and we both tell him to not do something or to do something and it&amp;#39;s no no I&amp;#39;m not going to do that but he will come and slap you or whatever I mean he kicks and hits me a little bit but he he&amp;#39;s always pushing his boundaries I think for everybody and he knows that he can push you further yeah so oh here&amp;#39;s an issue you know which actually has nothing to do with fa never mind go ahead do you have any other uh I was going to talk about books but that that&amp;#39;s not really raising kids with fa right not really but but you have problems when you got fa you have eye issues right too where that makes it hard to focus on reading a book to them that&amp;#39;s something you can&amp;#39;t easily do right yes I&amp;#39;m sure you guys have noticed my eyes jump It&amp;#39;s called pronounce it wrong no I&amp;#39;m going to pronounce it wrong must something like that so her her eyes will go left to right really fast you know it&amp;#39;s just for a quick second and then they&amp;#39;re normal but sometimes they do it more than often is it is it a nerve response or something or brain wave I honestly don&amp;#39;t know and she just did it then I don&amp;#39;t know if you could see it on camera y she&amp;#39;s doing it again right now and it makes by eyes kind a brown so when your eyes are doing that you can&amp;#39;t focus it&amp;#39;s impossible to it&amp;#39;s hard to it&amp;#39;s hard to focus and I probably need to wear glasses I know and I probably need see actual eye doctor for real and you can have 2020 Vision or close to it and still read or Focus like somebody that is basically legally blind with this and you&amp;#39;re still doing it again now people might see this on on video hopefully they do there it is yeah they if they focus in on on this they can see you doing that okay anything else um I think I have close2 I yeah but because of this I I am supposed to we lastes and even than it sometimes doesn&amp;#39;t help so I don&amp;#39;t know my oldest son asked me to read a book in the middle of the night to them last night and you know I feel bad cuz I I do I read all the time stuff that I like that I&amp;#39;m researching or you know stuff about things that you know or for me and Natalie Natalie and I we read stuff all the time and we read reviews blah blah blah but reading a story book to me is boring you know and I hate to feel that way because I know that maybe 20 years down the road they&amp;#39;re going to say well Daddy either read me this or he did didn&amp;#39;t and he didn&amp;#39;t take the time so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a frustration with me I feel bad because it&amp;#39;s something I can&amp;#39;t really do I mean if I really sit down and try in perfect lighting like up in the wheelchair but like when he came in last night I asked you to do that we were already laid down in bed and there was not really any light there and so again that kind of excludes me like I don&amp;#39;t know momy doesn&amp;#39;t to physically do things like that we haven&amp;#39;t we haven&amp;#39;t even like really pushed the boundaries of like the physical issues affecting going places especially like the forest the mountains you know going hiking on Trails which for the most part is impossible for you and we have gotten to arguments and fights over the last three years you know when I bring it up you know what if I want to take my kids camping you know in a tent or go you know see the mountains or whatever go to the beach and yes they have beach chairs and some beach places but it&amp;#39;s something we haven&amp;#39;t attempted one day we&amp;#39;re going to go to the beach well I&amp;#39;m not saying the beach is B they don&amp;#39;t get to the beach I take them to the beach but like my my mom just brought a property that there&amp;#39;s no way she can access and I don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s any way she could access it even when they get it cleared out in a covert and all put in driveway or if she would just have to unload and stay in one spot you know it&amp;#39;s a fishing spot a canal and a close to a lake and all um the kids you know need to enjoy that kind of stuff um and what do you feel when when somebody says you know this place is not accessible some of it I understand but yes it still hurts yeah or like even them like growing up and playing sports like and we we don&amp;#39;t have like a group of friends that would help Natalie like carry her around uh the forest or in Aries and and this is probably some she used to have like some people that did that when she was in Te you like a BJ&amp;#39;s family right they would they would just put her on their shoulder and put them on her back and just you know carry her wherever they needed to get her you know and you can do so much with a manual chair you definitely can&amp;#39;t do any off-road stuff in that chair she&amp;#39;s in none at all and unfortunately they quit making off-road tires for these chairs so you would have to buy a a wheelchair that&amp;#39;s specific for off you know ATV type which means everything comes out of pocket you know no insurance pays for it so getting a beach chair or something I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s an option for our area the I don&amp;#39;t know but we did we did when we first got together we went to state parks and I almost killed her a few times going up and down Hills potholes and getting stuck and even when she was pregnant with our first kid we we had fun all the time until he was born it it kind of sucks that we we aren&amp;#39;t able to have that fun and again we are older it&amp;#39;s not as easy our parents a lot of them have passed away and or are older and we don&amp;#39;t have people we can rely on to babysit the kids so that me and Mom can go out and have fun it just we just don&amp;#39;t really have fun as a couple unfortunately that&amp;#39;s another topic for like an inner abled topic we&amp;#39;re going to do one day interabled relationships was Dr Phil right you know when he said you know interabled relationships end in 100% failure you you I mean you never know but we&amp;#39;ll talk about that one day how do you actually know though cuz we&amp;#39;re our relationships sowh yeah yeah I mean and and there are people Able Body relationships that are get together for 30 years and then they get divorced and you know you never know until you die or go into a nursing home or whatever kid was right are you so we we&amp;#39;re close to our time limit anything else we need to talk about so it&amp;#39;s very annoying but as my friends told me like I struggled with most part of with all three of them and my big issue was not being able to physically do things and I remember my one friend who is an OB nurse telling me that it&amp;#39;s not all about what you can physically do I&amp;#39;m there to teach them and to love them and be there for their boo boos and that kind of thing so I try to always I&amp;#39;m going to cry I try to always hold on to that and although it&amp;#39;s very hard and I do struggle with a lot of things I wouldn&amp;#39;t change any of it for anything in the world like I still love being a mommy all right we&amp;#39;re about at 30 minutes and uh I know we&amp;#39;re going to have to have a part two three four later CU we&amp;#39;re not going to be able to touch on everything so I guess that&amp;#39;s it like this video And subscribe to my Channel all right take care guys bye",

    "transcript": "respected panelist experts the moderator and the audience all those who have joined with us in online mode and all those who are attending The Summit in Indore I welcome you all on behalf of ataxia awareness Society to this first of its kind event of national Ataxia Summit it gives us immense pleasure and honor to have the noun Experts of international Fame from top level medical institutes with us today to Enlighten us with valuable insight about the topic Ataxia today we are feeling blessed to have here Dr achal srivastava a senior neurologist and medical researcher who heads clinical neurophysiology facility and atexia clinic at Ames New Delhi without further Ado I would like to introduce moderator of today&amp;#39;s panel discussion Dr anupam Gupta is a neonatologist from Manchester UK he did his mbbs and MD Pediatrics from Mumbai and got trained in neonatology from Newcastle UK and is also a fellow of Royal College of Pediatrics and child health he also has interest in research with PhD from dudham University he is passionate about patient focused human care and that&amp;#39;s why has kindly agreed to moderate the session for us today we are grateful Dr Gupta to have you here as the moderator of this panel discussion and now I request you Dr Gupta to introduce the panelists and carry forward the session thank you sorry because the question then comes that what is the local participation and do you think patients in India they have been able to participate in these trials they will be able to participate shortly because there is there is an operation and also people who are working at Texas have got big patient database and they are always eager to participate there is no age in participating um and do you think there has been any hindrance in terms of patient participation in terms of the distance India being a big country uh absolutely not specifically in presence of such inauguration there is no issue of uh collecting the patients in in general also other clinicians who are working on Ataxia they have got a very good and big database of uh Ataxia patients and they are always eager to participate okay um thank you so much um we&amp;#39;ll come back to you on this panel&amp;#39;s discussion thank you once again um the next finalist is Dr Farooq uh he is a principal scientist at Institute of genomics and integrative biology and which is under Council of scientific and Industrial Research Dr horuk did his mbbs from Kerala University and PhD from neurology and Ms he has worked mainly in the area of clinical genetics and genomics of Heritage ataxia uh he his Labyrinth a fan India program and uh they&amp;#39;re focusing on the disorder of the rare diseases is also an associate genetic counselor so um thank you so much once again for joining can you hear us can I the first question would be can you hear me um from God I can see you&amp;#39;re very heavy in terms of Diagnostics especially the DNA based diagnosis um so I&amp;#39;m going to be a bit controversial here and I&amp;#39;m going to ask many people wonder this question is that when in absence of any effective treatment why should anybody bother for expensive DNA molecular test foreign and the knowledge is ever and the new therapies are coming are on their way so unless we get to know we get to understand the genetic spectrum of our patients it will be a heterogeneous can you speak a bit slowly for us the line is not clear at all a bit slower okay I will just try to am I audible now clearly this is yeah there is some network issues that will be raining here but don&amp;#39;t worry I&amp;#39;ll try to mention my point I am just trying to say that um it is really challenging even to have received a diagnosis of um Ataxia genetically or maybe someone when it&amp;#39;s a matter of counseling patients so definitely the philosophy which works my mind and something to give um as a positive something to the patient and the family is just to look forward actually so the things are on their way like the failure therapies are coming in Asos and different um uh like the disease specific characters are on their way so unless we we establish this [Music] [Music] um so should I come back to you later you know because we are still struggling to understand you um um should we start again hello I think we lost um okay while we are waiting for him to come back um should we move on to Dr Paul Dr um thank you once again Dr all to join us um Dr Paul is a professor of the aerology and movement disorder um and a program director of movement disorder Fellowship it demands Bangalore um he did his MD from Chandigarh and DM from demands with Fellowship from Vancouver and Toronto he has got about 390 plus Publications and he has helped various posts at National and international levels so welcome and thank you once again for joining us thank you [Music] your expertise in spinal cerebral Ataxia yes um so um are there any specific problems in SCA uh which are different to you know uh FedEx attacks yeah um and how do we manage them and you know which problems are manageable so um I&amp;#39;ve just been back that there are problems of some you know I would be using the bilingual Style and if you can repeat your answers in Hindi as well that would be great so um Joe his final survival attractions specific problems thank you thank you Dr Gupta and thank you the society for giving me the opportunity uh I&amp;#39;ll be speaking many in English but I will tell something in Hindi but my Hindi may not be grammatically correct correct so either this pan is about that&amp;#39;s here the term medically what we use is uh those attacks yes which are autosomal dominant that means okay so these are unlike the Frederick&amp;#39;s attacks here where the the gene is inherited one from the mother one from the father but both of them are not clinically affected so it is autism decisive condition and it starts very early in life and the fetish Ataxia course is much more aggressive than the sca what is known as spino server attacks here which are inherited in autosomal dominant fashion that means is CMA either the mother or the father definitely has a disease though probably the disease severity may not be the same as the particular person which we are concerned it starts you know in the first decade in the first within the first 10 years so in general prognosis is much better and the course is also much you know favorable compared to the Fredericks attacks here but as the generation goes you know first generation second Nation third generation is repeat disorders or repeat try nucleotide repeat disorders so father is you know it had started at the age of 50 years the sun may get the age of at the age of 30 years and his son if his affected may get get the disease at the age of say 15 years suppose one two and three or certain ethnic communities back to the other countries you know there are SC is about 40 to 50 CSR defined now but we get mainly essay one two three so a characteristic immediately we can differentiate from the Pretty status yeah but um foreign apart from Ataxia and also they develop a neuropathy in the legs similarly sca3 those passive is a Type 3 Joe descent actually the original type probably Portuguese twisting of the hands legs this is the very common things in this one two three and another one spine surveys are type 12 only four attackers I am going to tell just passive is a type 2 DCA 12 a certain ethnic communities [Music] foreign that we also advise the patient to have speech therapy and bad me in the later stages swallowing problems another most important thing is that you should try to reduce the weight if you are overweight because oh full upper part of the body less group of fat but this is so the other four or five basic things we tell some ataxiers can have you know parkinsonism like half shaking is like aca2 there&amp;#39;s a type 2. um so definitely there is a scope of improvement with different different types of medicine according to the type of symptoms the patient has apart from the ataxial and taxes SCS sponsored scma problems though devices so this is the industrial what we practice in demands again we do a very good physiotherapy balance and gait exercise I&amp;#39;ll just tell you one more thing that I had an experience of treating all this not treating taking care of these patients with ayurvedic treatment because there is no specific treatment for this and we had done a control study with her ayurveda called colleagues because we do not have oral medicines they have given physiotherapy massage therapy there could be some improvement because these are all a pathway through the you know exercise which increases the brain factors brain derived neural trophic factors Etc Improvement thank you so much uh thank you so much Dr Paul um that was a very wonderful answer thank you um so moving on to Dr can you hear us yes please I can hear you so um there this year um if this is a non-profit umbrella organization representing about 7 000 rare disease patients and their families uh he&amp;#39;s also a member of rare diseases of various International organizations at Asia Pacific Europe and U.S level as well um but this is always in this voluntary capacity where he is by vocation he&amp;#39;s a professor in the department of experimental clinical pharmacology in University of Minnesota USA um his current research interests are developing Therapeutics of rare diseases which includes ataxia so um welcome once again um uh can I can I ask what what is the national policy on rare diseases and where does and they are talking about the India Indian context thank you for the opportunity to talk about it I think uh in terms of talking about the national policy I refer to Dr Verma who is the author of the policy written in 2017. so I defer that question to Dr Sharma to answer that uh as far as the policy is concerned I think there is still a lot more to be done um at this time I think I leave it that way let Dr varmaji answer that question please um so I like to say yes that is correct you can as I said earlier um you know when the the mod you know mahapita burmaji is here for that thing so again I refer to that question to him why it was not included and this question was asked to me as a representative of all rare diseases people ask me why not my disease not included what should I answer to them there are 7 000 of them which one is preferred which one is not preferred who is to supposed to ask that question I leave these questions rather than answers to you so also just for our knowledge um what are the benefits of any disease in getting included in the rare diseases Charter I&amp;#39;m so excited so once once a disease has been included in rare diseases what is the benefit patients tend to get I suppose that you know the whether the attacks are some any other disease is included in it the benefit is either Financial or social or any other Advantage uh benefits that should get our vision in one word we want all rare disease patients should have equal opportunities just like any person with a common disease that is our goal that is our mission um also finally um can you tell us about the orphan Drug Act and does it exist in India unfortunately it does not exist at this time we have made the several requests to the government of India but there is a I must make it clear that our friend act in the U.S is not applicable to in India here is the reason our contact Act is only for the new drugs not for the uh Ducks which are being manufactured in India at this time how many new drugs are discovered in India I&amp;#39;m not sure so unless the new drugs are involved we should not we cannot have the our fund Drug Act similar to the United States however being the generic drug companies we should have our own uh our phone Drug Act just specific to India that&amp;#39;s what we have made a request to the Ministry of Health to have a separate uh office for the orphan drug uh are from product development office in in under cdsu or minister of Health as I as I am told that that is being constant at this time I I don&amp;#39;t know when it is going to happen but we are making all efforts to make that happen because without a office it&amp;#39;s very difficult to recognition of the rare diseases if you ask any questions the minister they don&amp;#39;t know who is who&amp;#39;s going to answer that question at least if there is a place where one can and put the question directly to that person that is a very very uh possibility that you can get the answer whether right or wrong that&amp;#39;s a different story but we must have an office for our product development under cdsuo our minister of Health whatever that is this we have made this request and um fortunately we had a discussions with Ministry secretary in the Ministry of Health and they said that they are going to consider but I am not sure where it is at this time we are still fighting for it um thank you Dr matella um thank you so Dr Farooq are you back can we come back to you yes yeah uh can you hear me now clearly yeah this is much better no sorry actually uh the previous like um I was in a bad connectivity area and it is heavily raining here so is the reason for the connection so you may ask your question I&amp;#39;m sorry so basically um DNA diagnosis so um in terms of the management and this is progression overall patient management foreign [Music] the proper research or science scientists genetic investigations [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] testing or DNA testing no DNA testing yeah data is a natural history um foreign foreign uh [Music] um [Music] experience [Music] what is the evidence base you know uh knowledge [Music] sorry up hello you&amp;#39;re still yeah yeah thank you um thank you um stem cells foreign foreign disease in terms of the combination of science and research Supreme um thank you finally um foreign foreign thank you thank you thank you um yeah um so next question is um DNA or genetic studies genetic engineering language you have to unmute yeah so um [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] I think thank you um next is a um what is the utility of knowing the diagnosis and carrier state so good patients [Music] um foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Laughter] [Music] prenatal testing um yes okay thank you so um after all of this drilling I think we can open the floor to General discussion um basically we would be going through the different stages so basically symptoms possible treatments and finally living with Ataxia or Rehabilitation um so uh and then all the panelists can chip in you know depending upon your your experience and we would obviously like to benefit from your expertise and experience so maybe um is wanting to speak something about it he is writing in chat so can you allow him to speak yeah sure so question is the tremors so basically we are talking about the symptom resolution symptoms [Music] we have had different questions from uh delegates as well as the you know the family members he what is the best evidence base or the experience based modalities for different symptoms um anybody can answer this um number one is a diagnosis diagnosis the first step to anything whether you are fit for a trial what treatment is suitable for you based on treatment and based on diagnosis symptoms and the cause is different for each of them so you have to know what is the cause foreign foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign government has agreed to give up to 50 lakhs foreign foreign stimulation foreign [Music] foreign they are better able to answer them but certainly DNA test must be done the policy will cover a taxi has provided some treatment comes up to twenty nine years but you know government control system moves very slowly foreign so I hope this will answer some of the questions that have been raised thank you so much um for your confirmation that very useful knowledge um there is a question for you um from Mr rudra uh what is the lifespan of SCA through patients um I think can you be a little bit more specific for this uh question um about the lifespan I do not want to introduce or discuss this issue here because it depends on the many factors in Spanish as I already told that it is a disease and it depends on the number of repeat lengths you know the severity of the disease and so and plus also how good the patient has been taken care uh prevention of Falls prevention of pneumonia all these many other factors are there SCA by itself does not kill a patient okay and lifespan so there are many factors both factors so that is I think better not to discuss but it depends some part definitely as Dr Verma has also pointed out that the repeat links will determine the severity of the disease not the there is no specific cardiac involvement but I want to highlight one of two things we are talking about uh says the adult tonsil but you know the realities organization like we have formed in with Farooq myself we have all doing looking after a rear this is constitutely in India especially catering the movement is surface your attraction is one of the main thing especially in Southern India there are a lot of consanguinity Butler 45 to 48 rate of conservative means parents relative blood relatives and these propagates the autosomal decisive disorders so both cases including Fredericks yeah so a very after diagnosis if you know that there is autosomal disease we should try to prevent the Next Generation from propagating that attack say it is preventable you are you know it is better not to marry so that autism disorders does not carry forward in the Next Generation definitive autism treatment around starts around third or fourth year of Life large propensity to develop infections so these patients can be you know treated at least prevented from all those malignancy and the infections by regular screening patients and trial was quite successful the probably the information will come in a year or so about the treatment of antacid engine this year I&amp;#39;d be happy to take some more questions if you were to ask me because in the next 10 minutes if you can do that for us yeah yeah it asked me what you want me to say to be you know discussed maybe so there&amp;#39;s a question I have I see here 12 so my son is bound to have yesterday at one foreign already had told about this but our guideline says that we if your father or mother has some illness we cannot do a genetic testing on you if you are not having any problems so there&amp;#39;s a 50 chance which is say the 50 chance your son can have or but uh even 100 chances that your son may not have it okay thank you um so Mr rudra wants to know how can we participate in clinical trials so obviously I think as you have said so you know there are a lot of joint projects you guys have got um so uh it is really disappointing that India trial hardly we get opportunity to do trials especially in this case I was called by many people earlier to do pretty set Etc so I am sure that the main treatment centers like in India like you know already medical Sciences PJ Chandigarh yes down south demands all these five six places they will be the main persons I think doing the trial as a main Institute so you can get the information from them unfortunately we do not have a forum till now about you know the database or Distributing the information about the trials so I&amp;#39;ll not be able to tell that how we can reach out to you though if you are in the database definitely we can call you back from any of the centers so are you saying that&amp;#39;s the way forward is to you know gather as much information in the communication with the patients and you know the communication channels between the patient community and the medical community you know definitely so myself Dr Farooq Dr we were contemplating in the last one or two years to have a big you know uh Society of ataxia in India along with the caregiver support group we had started actually the movement disorder Society of India which is a scientific society and we are now getting a lot there&amp;#39;s a research win is also there uh we started in 2014. now myself probably will be heading towards starting Ataxia Society of India where we will have a patient group also and uh probably this patient group also can you know join with us and so that we can have a database which will be you know not revealed to the public but the doctors will have the data and probably when any trial anyone conducts we can reach out to you uh giving a you know whatever way we can anonymously it can be released out so um on the same line um the problem is that I am also a member of this attacks a global Foundation but the there are two aspects of This research they are very insistent on giving blood samples to be sent out of India which we cannot do for our health the Ministry of Health and isima does not allow to send samples outside India and we also don&amp;#39;t see any justification of sending DNA or anything outside India because we have the capacity to do everything in India okay so genetic testings so the primary goal of these people who come to us all these addresses the foundations is to do trials but also at the same time to take the blood samples so there nowadays the problem is that the trial gets you know cut off at the uh DCA level only level only and it doesn&amp;#39;t come to us even if it come to us there are so much of Ethics regulations are there in the at this in our Institute that hardly we you know have a chance to really participate in this trials and the regulations is so strict so it is difficult but though we have really conducted one trial about two years back on that is a delegate this year but we do not get much support from the European or the Asian uh you know attacks the foundations and I feel that we should do our attraction Foundation our society and because we have a varied type of disorders which cannot be compared with the rest of the world and we have a different type of problems and our social structure is different and our needs are also different compared to others can you please add on that oh I I I think one of the reason uh why we are not having uh clinical trials in India so the the drug companies have to come here are our companies should invent some new drugs then the trials will come if we have drugs in our country I&amp;#39;m sure that uh Dr Paul and other people will jump in to do the clinical trials we are not doing that we are not getting the new drugs yeah it is also that&amp;#39;s my answer like this thank you um [Music] actually the government is not encouraging to get the new drugs they are always supporting the genetic drugs generic does you know do not stand for the clinical trials Dr bharma GA has something to say please has said the right thing trial will be only on new drugs new Therapies [Music] every few months [Music] foreign insurance companies [Music] so I think there is more chance in the coming few years that we will do something in India [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Elizabeth India foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign thank you um so any comments from the panelist about what talked about um leaving but happy thank you very much for summarizing the important you know aspects of this discussion and the message and I also want to give you know my message that we will do away definitely with the patients of ataxia in India and we&amp;#39;ll try our best to be with you and inform you as much as possible and hope in the next one year we can have make the grounds or base for making this you know bigger Society could be a better participation thank you can I make a comment please hello hello can you hear me hello yes yes yeah I think I have a message to the patient organizations there should be much more active because the most of the time patient organizations are silent speakers unless they speak up it&amp;#39;s difficult to hear their voice either in the community of clinicians are in the government they are the really the push us to make things happen you know the patients are the key for everything without patient there is nothing else there so I strongly suggest that a patient organization should be much more active in promoting their own cars that&amp;#39;s what I want to tell to the patient our organizations here thank you Dr Matilda over to our delegates okay I&amp;#39;m going to read this question uh from Mr Agarwal uh I think this is addressed to uh this is regarding the antenatal investigations so he is talking about his son and daughter-in-law are planning for baby the doctor has suggested them to opt for IBM foreign I am just going through the chat to understand the question I I think I got the question my son and daughter five years in which MW will be tested and then in fact this is an expensive procedure yes these are um let&amp;#39;s say in one way uh a very good method to actually in um foreign foreign [Music] or um foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you thank you for such a comprehensive um which questions foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign foreign you should make use of them those expert a neurologists here and to minimize the problem foreign foreign about this dilemma well I think as a patient you have some responsibility of your own how much you can make use of those assisted devices um and that&amp;#39;s number one number two your family is the most supportive asset than anybody else no matter what anybody says so that&amp;#39;s another asset you have you cannot just divide uh those two things and you know do what the best you can do that&amp;#39;s my suggestion please thank you um then there is a question from Mr kedar uh this is in terms of the policy matter so whether there should be acceptability of digital signatures in bank which would help you know the patients and the families with the with the you know different types of uh um abilities what do you think and especially coming from your role in uh rare diseases I I don&amp;#39;t know about too much about the electronic signatures or identification of that because yes now the government is more or less in every areas they are pushing towards the computerization I.T technology something uh you know for the benefit of everybody you know if it was not there probably we had to make uh learned how how to use it or do something about it I don&amp;#39;t think that to be away from such a new technology is not a good idea foreign [Music] I have some suggestions in that one I have been very proponent of providing some kind of employment opportunities for this attacks are any other red illustrations simply because if they are not doing anything they are becoming non-productive to the country I am sure that they have the ability to use something on their own yes they may not be able to do as much as anybody else other other persons like you and me but they can do it they can contribute to the productivity for that reason I asked all the industries come up with ideas employ them in whatever they can do if suppose they can only do one tenth of the work that is being done by normal people only pay one tenth of that but that keeps occupy in uh you know in the industry and they estimate the self-esteem will go up for the patients I think Industries should try to do something about it um what do you think is is there any evidence or is there any you know role of these medicines um in the long term uh management of ataxia foreign foreign [Music] [Music] definitely put a general cellular Healthcare important thank you um Mr ravindra wants to ask something how are you uh Dr Farooq sorry I couldn&amp;#39;t participate in this particular discussion of the vitaminian foreign do you recommend any supplement for any Improvement of cellular health since around 20 years time any other drug which has come as a supplement for uh the Improvement of cellular health y scientists um um available so you know foreign important but more my question is actually to Dr Burma score here it is [Music] after one month are you still there no he&amp;#39;s not here but I may try to answer yes do it is not mentioning the list of heritages but it is very well considered as a reading but the thing is if it is listed on uh is it would it be better uh although uh it is told that uh if if there is no Treatment available it is not to be listed in the list of ladies but don&amp;#39;t you think this uh sort of you know uh it should be listed even though it doesn&amp;#39;t have any feedback like maybe some Escape of the financial instance can be in terms of buying a strip devices or any other thing which can be stopped even sir nowadays the disability certificate which is given to a tax patients it doesn&amp;#39;t have the mention of the terms yeah it is served as either locomotive disability or something else as I mentioned earlier there are more than seven thousands known reasons it&amp;#39;s difficult to include all the things but make sure I can assure you that if you want your disease to be get benefited from the earth the policy matters yes it is done it is there even though your name is not there it is eligible help [Music] it does not happen I understand the Dilemma as a patient organization I do understand and that is the struggle that we have to fight for it as I said even though our name is not there yes you are eligible for the uh benefits or whatever that is there the the policy dictates foreign in that policy there is not much written for the uh families it&amp;#39;s only they are focusing on the patient at this time remember this is the first time India has ever written a policy for the rare diseases so there is a lot to be done a lot to be included as as time goes by new therapists come new diagnosis come there all need to be included as it happens as I said that is just the beginning it&amp;#39;s just the beginning I think as I said earlier it is the voice of patients that make things happen not the industries to the University of Health and Social Justice specifically to the address to the union minister of uh to include uh biology Ataxia as a part of relatives along with you know we had taken Dr paduk&amp;#39;s advice also and we had done a lot of valuation in that so that letter has gone to the unionist but not no reply as of now I think has come from uh there I I do understand because I get the same frustrations that you have I have written many many letters from all the way to prime minister to the person personal assistant um it&amp;#39;s unfortunately in India it&amp;#39;s very common not to answer the question letters but my advice as I do keep writing it one day you will get it because I&amp;#39;m doing the same thing I&amp;#39;m advising the same thing to you just don&amp;#39;t give up so what do you enjoy our attacks have been in society has written as a part of the organization to the union Minister uh you are advising to write as a on the individual capacity no no I I don&amp;#39;t think it hurts if you write individually but the as an organization it has got much more weight society that group being created along with Dr faru uh sir we are ready to uh participate heavily in that as a part in fact if you can add all of us uh we are ready to you know contribute and spread as much awareness so that your database increases as much as possible [Music] yes foreign should we move on to question by Mr naresh um Mr binayak Mr Vijay Mr Vijay Mata please go ahead foreign good evening sir am I Audible yes you are I am since uh three years I am suffering from multiple system at trophy say a little bit later what type of artaxia only this gives some information now I am suffering from Raising problem also I was going to come but I can could not come because of my operating problem here my doctor

    "transcript": "hello there folks my name is scott lynch i&amp;#39;m here to do one more episode of discuss journey story last time we&amp;#39;re here we have my sister&amp;#39;s train and we have a mom over there this time we&amp;#39;ve actually had a few people who got my little sister sarah here and i&amp;#39;ve got my grandma here we&amp;#39;re going to tell the story of what things first started with into my first service oh god big enough mom where did you see those i swear when we first noticed yes mom noticed i noticed at first honey because when we put you down to walk you would stagger like you didn&amp;#39;t have control of your legs or something and i kept saying there&amp;#39;s something wrong he&amp;#39;s too awkward he shouldn&amp;#39;t be falling around as much as he had and the doctors kept saying it was normal how old was he remember probably two and i started talking about how much you would fall when you&amp;#39;re walking you always skinning up your knees and falling so that was the but then we didn&amp;#39;t he was what nine years old probably before we finally was 12 12. he got a better memory nowadays he was 12 when we went to saint louis oh wow what was in st louis when i officially diagnosed at the walk to school by ascending in st louis i was 12 years old i&amp;#39;ll go ahead and bake her up on that part washington school of medicine is where we took him in st louis okay and that&amp;#39;s where they put the big long needles and did electric things with it my dad always joked around saying they&amp;#39;d zigny is this long into me well they wore that well actually probably a little bit longer they were like they didn&amp;#39;t mention the fact they&amp;#39;d be playing you loved your shocks it hurt but then it was a long time before you were able to control your walking work pretty well for quite a while and when you started driving jimmy not worried that you would not be able to get to the break in time something but you did good he drove until well he drove you i remember briefly scott walking like because i i have like one memory of being in the garage and you were like stumbling around the car but that&amp;#39;s all i remember and then falling through the the he wall to take you today i remember there being a hole in the wall for a little bit he took me right there we just bought that malibu black malibu that scott loved nobody could eat you couldn&amp;#39;t do you could eat you couldn&amp;#39;t do anything in it but the girlfriends could come in and sit in this lab while he was driving but nobody else and he used to take you to daycare oh that&amp;#39;s scary [Laughter] until the day that the malibu went over into the ditch well one thing do you mind take her to take care there&amp;#39;s a little bit of trouble because that was the same time sarah realized i&amp;#39;d learn traffic lanes she didn&amp;#39;t tell if they&amp;#39;re right or if they&amp;#39;re green the ladybug was she didn&amp;#39;t know what shark likes looking and she would tend to tell me quite a bit for running with lights we&amp;#39;re running red lights well scott&amp;#39;s colorblind how&amp;#39;d you know the difference between green and red my life was pretty old it was like crossing which is a state track like this there was like a sky you just read a red light but the car went in the ditch and when i by the time i got there scott was sitting outside the car holding the bumper holding the front bumper with a terrible look on his face he was so sad i don&amp;#39;t remember oh yeah that was in the middle like yes it did like 3 000 i think dollars worth of damage underneath and there wasn&amp;#39;t just a stretch anywhere no it just knocked the bumper off down like into a wooded area because you couldn&amp;#39;t get the break i think yeah it was good bob we kept with the great idea 12 rugs already thousand bats and everybody and keep the mats clean oh i got that from her it&amp;#39;s her fault i haven&amp;#39;t been doing it with my car you haven&amp;#39;t let&amp;#39;s see now your mats are dirty but now who had the wreck with the lipstick on the air bag was that what are you talking about he was supposed to be driving but the airbag had lipstick on it now tell me how that works [Music] [Music] [Laughter] never seen an air bag that had been deployed so i went down there to go check it out i was like lipstick i&amp;#39;m like scott we couldn&amp;#39;t eat or drink in the car but the girls could come and sit in his lap while he&amp;#39;s driving i guess [Laughter] oh so when this bounce guy do you want you want to tell some more stories what else we got yeah i guess bring down stories this time let&amp;#39;s focus that tree for a while i&amp;#39;ll be involved in san diego shrimp well i actually stayed in love with this for a while out there sure he decided to come visit one day too much of the rest of the structure i don&amp;#39;t even know what you&amp;#39;re talking about anyways they brought the hotel room i heard a bunch of girls that she worked with they were at a hotel overlooking the ocean there in san diego we just watched the sun go down over the ocean which was nice now to look at now more than five days later my wonderful bright sister here decides that we should all wake up early so we could watch the sunrise over the same ocean we tried to explain to you why we couldn&amp;#39;t do that going to come up somewhere you just had the wrong side of the san diego she meant the mountains not the ocean no when they were in san diego when i went out to there to visit them back home that&amp;#39;s right let&amp;#39;s tell that story gone these toys are actually laid back me somehow we had a girl from costa rica come and stay with us irene and we were all excited how were you at the time just before me yeah of course way before you this is pre sarah back in the dark days and we were all so excited to get her get this girl to come and stay with us for a couple months and scott was showing her everything going down the road this is a tree this is our trees this is our fields and look that&amp;#39;s our moon and she started laughing she goes yes scott we have the same moon you didn&amp;#39;t think that was that funny did you that&amp;#39;s our hitman we haven&amp;#39;t figured that one out yet and then sarah pushed him around in san diego when you were in the third grade i guess yeah third the last two months of third grade to half of fifth grade and you were in a manual wheelchair at the time yeah we were what was it old town old town yeah we were um i don&amp;#39;t know why it was just you and me and why i was i don&amp;#39;t know why we were left together but you all were somewhere and we went we weren&amp;#39;t far we went i never thought about that part of the story we went to meet you all somewhere and i feel like we were meeting you at like a i don&amp;#39;t even know but uh so we were we were going across the street and so i was pushing you and i think like the light was gonna turn so we were like oh let&amp;#39;s go and so i started running pushing you and you dumped right out and you had kohana your service dog with you and you dumped right out in the middle of the road and no i didn&amp;#39;t know what to do because i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;m probably eight or nine probably nine uh and the light turns green and so cars are honking and um so people get out of their car and i&amp;#39;m like i don&amp;#39;t know what to do and so people get out of the car and start helping and i&amp;#39;m kind of just watching like not really sure what&amp;#39;s going on and then someone put his shoulder on my arm his hand on my shoulder and was like it&amp;#39;s okay we all make mistakes [Laughter] [Music] but we got you situated we made it back to mama no at some point you weren&amp;#39;t wearing a seat belt at the time i guess were you not at that point so then we said you know maybe a seat belt would be handy well then that also happens in new york with you all yeah dumped him in new york so i put him on a train track one time wait what in san diego you put him on a train track i dumped him on the train traction oh you dumped him too yeah crossing the trolley lanes and his chair go over it and about he goes it&amp;#39;s possible that we had had a few drinks while we were out in downtown san diego that night and a dump team and i was laughing so hard i couldn&amp;#39;t get him we had to get home these stories do involve a couple of drinks just that one just when it was you and her just when i was around um i don&amp;#39;t know i don&amp;#39;t know i got lots of stories i just don&amp;#39;t know how many i&amp;#39;m allowed to tell i feel like i&amp;#39;m much better now about like lifting the i haven&amp;#39;t dumped you out since then it&amp;#39;s obviously like my lesson yeah i haven&amp;#39;t ducked him since then you just gotta do it once the bad story is when he fell and broke his teeth that was bad about the time he dumped himself the power wheels i think we told that story about the power wheels or i&amp;#39;ve i&amp;#39;ve typed i&amp;#39;ve told the story on the parent group about the power wheels because there was a question on there about someone getting power wheels and i&amp;#39;m like warning warning yeah be careful of the story wheels and we had gone to a friend&amp;#39;s house in san diego and scott wanted to show our friend the uh how the power wheels work so you push them a little bit and then there&amp;#39;s settings that you can put on the tires and they&amp;#39;ll start rolling on their own with little effort so he pushed him and i think the setting was set a little bit too high maybe and it was and it was going down just a little bit of an incline little lips though get you yes so where the the driveway in the road met was you know down a little bit and his front wheels caught with those power wheels on and dumped him upside down face first onto the pavement and the wheelchair is attached to him at this time the power wheels are probably 30 pounds a piece that was awful it was a heavy chair planted upside down on his face so his face was busted his tooth was missing his leg wasn&amp;#39;t like you still got like a tight dress it&amp;#39;s a [Music] our stuff in the house and we were just visiting or maybe we didn&amp;#39;t live there anymore because we were leaving back to go back the next day yep yep yeah you&amp;#39;re right so this is school you had to go back to school because he was wanting me to stay and i&amp;#39;m like i gotta get you there was high school at the time or something like it yeah no i went franklin you were we were living in indianapolis okay so i was in middle school but but still we weren&amp;#39;t living there and it was like we&amp;#39;ll shoot you&amp;#39;re going to the emergency room yeah so we took him to the emergency room his clothes were all bloody and they gave him he was he was panicking at the time and i was trying to keep the blood from i couldn&amp;#39;t tell what was broke there was something up here broke and i kept a towel over you to keep the pressure and he said i can&amp;#39;t breathe breathe so he&amp;#39;s pushing me away and one of the other neighbors was going off the deep end and call 9-1-1 and do this and i said no no no i said a head wound bleeds really bad let&amp;#39;s just see what&amp;#39;s going on so after we got ourselves together we put him in the car and took him to the hospital he broke his tooth broke his nose um he didn&amp;#39;t fracture anything on his face or anything and then they gave him something to calm him down because in no time he was talking about stuff that didn&amp;#39;t be mexican oh my gosh and they come in and they check his blood pressure and you know they&amp;#39;re all concerned and he just looks at them and then they said are you feeling okay he says yep and he turns around and shrieking so anyway i think it was like nothing ever happened i&amp;#39;m like ooh i need some of those gifts through his lips it was his teeth cut his lip and i think it was stuck in his lip but there may be some still in there we looked the dentist looked around trying to find it she goes i don&amp;#39;t feel anything but it could be something still in his lip so anyway though that was nice that was because like all the other uh dumps in the road were then we all had to leave the next day anyway leave them there ray stayed there because he had a convention so we checked in a couple of times yeah but we survived we made it it was the end it wasn&amp;#39;t fun but we made it i don&amp;#39;t remember i guess that would have been alex that was with us on that trip because i had one of

    "transcript": "hello and welcome to episode 2 of The Frederick cataxia series today&amp;#39;s topic of discussion is pregnancy and childbirth so this is my personal experience with childbirth I have had three children and yes they all are biological so when I was younger my doctor told me that it was possible to have children but she did not know if I would be able to have them naturally or not so fast forward 20 years mean Dan me we get together we do things and I end up pregnant and um oh I went to my doctor first and my doctor said okay Mom I&amp;#39;m not really sure how many it was but all right so we just say we gotta go along with things so that was an Obe and obese I saw said yes it was most definitely possible for you to carry a baby but there could be issues such as problems with your heart um problems with the babies are problems with my breathing check with my neurologists etc etc so even though I have not seen a neurologist in many many years because even according to underground it just my fa is so Progressive there&amp;#39;s nothing they can do and it&amp;#39;s not like a light one twenties with that face so I went to their neurologist and he said yeah you you&amp;#39;re a baby um now because I have smaller lungs and I already have asthma he was like you may have respiratory issues so for that you want to see Implement just and we need to see you first a sonogram of your heart and you need to see a cardio I went to the cardiologist and did everything they said they said ah you look great go for it illuminology was another story he was not really sure he&amp;#39;d not think that I would be able to carry the baby and I was gonna have trouble breathing in the blood and to an extent he was right um I didn&amp;#39;t have trouble breathing because my small lung capacity that might as like eight months pregnant it was pretty difficult um but the baby and Barbara tells and conditions so facts though because the Opie was like well we&amp;#39;ve guys um because with the fa one of one of the symptoms that is common I&amp;#39;m not gonna say everyone has that because I don&amp;#39;t know that but it&amp;#39;s common to have scoliosis effect and I do have scoliosis and I have parenting rods month the entire way down my spine so the uh epidural was kinda kind of an issue they thought as to if they could get a place correctly that&amp;#39;s what they had to see apologists saved so they thought they could like they asked yourself my back into the sonogram of where my tailbone was and my lower spine and they thought they&amp;#39;d get in through the internet so come Namaste later here we go and I go into the hospital and I&amp;#39;m having trouble breathing which was the case so they decided they were going to uh induce me I go in and I get induced I was 37 weeks and labor begins labor was not fun they go to put them in her head I&amp;#39;ve been in labor I think an hour labor but it still wasn&amp;#39;t that fun and so they go to put the girl in it and I place it and they get a place but doesn&amp;#39;t do anything I don&amp;#39;t doesn&amp;#39;t numb at all so they let me go a little bit through more labor still that epidural did not take any effect so they were like okay what do I do with her now they ended up giving me fentanyl which was horrible horrible stuff horrible so 24 hours of Labor passes and I&amp;#39;m a dilated meaners and I&amp;#39;m just starting to push and Earl of Rugrats decides he&amp;#39;s gonna flip around the corner route is that so I was rushed in for an emergency C-section so they took the baby out and the baby was fine it was a little bit jaundice but other than that he was fine so by this time we knew it was possible forbid to carry and have baby so about a year and a half later maybe a little longer I got pregnant again and this time I ended up at a different open he loved the goodness I&amp;#39;m so sorry I ended up at a different opinion um e wasn&amp;#39;t too bothered by my fa at all um but he did they did I could really have natural job birthday just didn&amp;#39;t think I would be able to push and I&amp;#39;m one of these don&amp;#39;t you dare tell me yet because I will so he set me up with a uh uh for sale the doctor I risk yeah a high-risk doctor and of course they put you on certain precautions because I am in a wheelchair so I have to do like the heppard shots and then she gave me uh I&amp;#39;ve been in a case that I can take like daily as a preventive so we just kind of monitored things and at 35 weeks I had a really bad day and like Museum or arguing and really really grouchy and uncomfortable I think I have barks the digs I was just not happy and so we got the car to go to the hospital just to see you like and make sure I wasn&amp;#39;t actually in labor and we went to grab a bite to eat at Arby&amp;#39;s afterwards I felt so much better I looked Santa&amp;#39;s like just go home I don&amp;#39;t want to go to hospital so we came back home and that night we kind of I don&amp;#39;t even think we really did like and I ended up taking stomach but I said because I still felt nauseous so I go to bed and I like two in the morning I wake up and I&amp;#39;m screaming bloody burner and then it&amp;#39;s like what and I&amp;#39;m like I&amp;#39;ll be there Diner I&amp;#39;m in labor uh like get me into a hospital now so we call number one and the whole time I was actually in the ambulance in labor and I&amp;#39;m like oh my gosh the EMTs were like this crazy but they were great they were wonderful so we get to the hospital and I see the on-call doctors and she&amp;#39;s like all right you&amp;#39;re poor savings let you go naturally so let me go naturally and by then we had already decided the epidurals don&amp;#39;t work so when I say that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;d be natural I didn&amp;#39;t have anything so about halfway through Labor I just I was freaking it was so painful so the nurse said I didn&amp;#39;t give you something that I&amp;#39;ll just ease the pain so as long as it wasn&amp;#39;t enough was so good better I was like okay so I took a little bit of Medicine but it didn&amp;#39;t really wear it off or anything it just kind of it helped so I&amp;#39;m gonna put you asleep between uh contractions is what it did so yeah exactly it let me go to sleep between it but just kind of nice so it&amp;#39;s probably now what 4 35 in the morning and I go through library for a few more hours and a clock rolls around and mile become science working like okay and I will remember this guy like had confidence in me but did not think I&amp;#39;m gonna boost me out at all and like five minutes after he got there my water broke probably about what 10 minutes after that I found a sharp pain he broke your water yeah the doctor broke your water and it was it was taken longer than he thought it should take so he was fixing to put one of those suction things on his head and try to pull it out but guess what I said was that episode because I thought it was really in her pain and they said no Maya everybody says he&amp;#39;s out he&amp;#39;s out looks it was like a football coming that shot out of her so fast all it seen was like a streak or a shadow just zip through there it took her a while to realize that that was the baby that was out already it&amp;#39;s definitely possible so fast for another year and a half and I&amp;#39;m pregnant for a third time with Jonathan and I was absolutely miserable the entire pregnancy dad says I was quite the witch um so my first daughter sounds when thing was normal and fine and thanks for progressing normally but I could tell the baby was huge I was so uncomfortable like all the time I go in for my second ultrasound and they&amp;#39;re like oh my God this kid is double the size of what it should be so the high risk doctor said that that wasn&amp;#39;t your ultrasound when she looked at the tech right she&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s no way this could be yeah they I mean he&amp;#39;s like exploded like overnight so by then I had my sugar glucose which you know how horrible those are and I felt it so that&amp;#39;s when they decided I had just install diabetes and say because they decided that and he was so large they decided they were going to have to Appliance Syrian so I wasn&amp;#39;t that happy about it but a single day so I ended up going into the hospital a week before I was going to have a C-section and again they did like the heart ultra sound and they did like all the public uh Jay stop I just all those things once again just to make sure that everything was okay and it was thank goodness so I went in and what time was that day you leave the story from here because you don&amp;#39;t remember but we&amp;#39;re pretty insistent on me being in the room right oh yes that was like the major point then I wanted since like the first C-section I had was their emergency section and didn&amp;#39;t get to be there like I wanted it there like second I had to be put to sleep both of them so I wasn&amp;#39;t quite like going in there or going in and having just this detection and you still got the express Shoppers like I do not see personally how women can stand to be awake even if they&amp;#39;re numbed because a C-section is a major operation and we had a nurse warn us about that I shouldn&amp;#39;t even go to the uh the room and we had a few of them say less nonsense it&amp;#39;s just normal you know but but this one was right it is very rough it&amp;#39;s a very major surgery there was blood everywhere and they&amp;#39;re mopping blood up everywhere and they&amp;#39;re jerking on their body and uh were they had curtains up to block me from seeing stuff and I could not stand up I had to sit in this certain chair until a certain time I could not um you know film or photo until a certain time you know they&amp;#39;re like don&amp;#39;t you&amp;#39;re not allowed to take this you&amp;#39;re not allowed to do this you&amp;#39;re not allowed to see us put her to sleep you know in case something happens so it was very controlled and the doctor really didn&amp;#39;t want me to be there anyway but somehow there was like a probably 15 plus people doing different things you know doctors nurses texts you know scrambling around but the the issue with the uh gestational diabetes is that he would he probably would have been 15 pounds by the time he would have tried to you know and so he was how many pounds was he when we nine something almost blinding almost nine pounds so he would have been about 15 pounds if we&amp;#39;d have waited till the full term and yeah she probably possibly could have died you know there&amp;#39;s people have probably given birth to a 15 pound baby but it&amp;#39;s rare and with a reduced lung capacity and all that it&amp;#39;s um but this this was probably our our hardest right because we had to stay in the baby ICU and all that yeah yeah go ahead and say how hard it was because you were it was really hard like uh as most women know I&amp;#39;m saying all about cry um when you have well you have a baby your hormones is gonna go crazy Leo so like right afterwards it&amp;#39;s not not I didn&amp;#39;t even I was in able to see him for like 48 hours when they separate them they usually give you an iPad to see them so you gotta and you know while she&amp;#39;s in recovery and he&amp;#39;s not in the same room so so you get to see them through an iPad through was it FaceTime or something yeah I like this stuff you don&amp;#39;t get you know the mother doesn&amp;#39;t get to touch them for until she has so much recovering and is allowed to go to the ICU yeah thank you whatever you want to call it so that was probably really hard because I was about like your body is like going through all these changes and really fast and there&amp;#39;s no baby there to like to show for it and then like I&amp;#39;m I was producing milk like crazy so I&amp;#39;m like Lincoln everywhere and because he was pre-term he wasn&amp;#39;t taking food for like six seven days something like that so he they said you know his oxygen levels were really low and you know even though he was nine pounds he wasn&amp;#39;t fully developed his lungs and everything so they kept him on oxygen for for what like a week and that brings another stress we already had two young kids at home we had people babysitting them and they were getting tired of it while our kid was in NICU for two weeks or whatever was it two weeks or three or what I was almost too so if we got to a point where we would have to come home and the doctors and nurses would be like why aren&amp;#39;t you up here with him and we live on an hour away with two young kids so we we still tried to get up there every day I think right yeah but you know afterwards he was healthy healthy and one thing that he did not like was the the formula that they gave him no so we had to kindly try to get breast milk to him you know going up and down different floors you know pumping her milk and yeah memory see I didn&amp;#39;t even think about this when we were filming it but now it&amp;#39;s kind of coming back what else did you tried they dried for real I like that twice and he would take care threw it up and they didn&amp;#39;t have any alternative they only had one brand so breast milk we had to feed him breast milk and we had to bring it every day I think so I&amp;#39;m like pumping I pumped like crazy I don&amp;#39;t like it and they said oh you have enough milk to be 10 babies but like a lot of work that&amp;#39;s definitely a hard thing because it has the caregiver but but they kind of allowed my cousin to uh be listed as a second caregiver so that she could actually go see the baby otherwise it might have been four or five days before she seen them or she might only got to see him every other day I don&amp;#39;t know because I had to try to uh be home with the kids as much as possible the other two yeah and we were given the option to stay at the hospital what was it like five dollars a night for up to 70 days as long as they didn&amp;#39;t need the room but again we were stressing out the babysitters so so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s pretty much how Jonathan came around yes and after all three I&amp;#39;ll be a little strong boys little babies and what she forgot to mention about the first one was because it was an early planned induction um they put you on a steroid right for like a week like three shots steroid to uh to get his lungs and everything you know to kind of age like like you know ages lungs and uh build up his uh muscles and stuff and his immune system and it worked um but uh the second one they were surprised that he had no problems because he just came out of nowhere you know and he we went right home after like two days and 35 weeks yeah that was perfect and [Music] hopefully he doesn&amp;#39;t have any continuing health problems that we see other than he&amp;#39;s a bigger kid so um I guess is that how you want to end it yeah so that&amp;#39;s my experience with Shoppers um I don&amp;#39;t know if you guys have questions I can try to answer them remember we&amp;#39;re not a health care professional you need to uh if you&amp;#39;re thinking about having a kid and you have fa um consult your family physician your neurologist you&amp;#39;re a pulmonologist and you&amp;#39;re in endocrinologist and uh try to get with everybody and see if they&amp;#39;re on the same page and if there&amp;#39;s if there&amp;#39;s one or two that aren&amp;#39;t on the same page you get a second opinion you know we can&amp;#39;t say go get pregnant you know and guarantee you&amp;#39;re going to have a healthy birth or anything like that and this is just our story and Natalie could have very well died with you know if if something you know or the baby one or two of the babies could have died you know without the right uh medical help you know so but thank God they&amp;#39;re all healthy yes they are so remember like this video And subscribe to my channel",

    "transcript": "B so in the mixed upper motor and lower motor neuron diseases I have gone through the M pneumonic right there was a m pneumonic for that motor neuron disease AIA Frederick AIA right then sub combined degeneration and last one was t St cellus right so in these diseases we&amp;#39;re going to see the upper motor and low motor neuron features in Combined form right so let&amp;#39;s talk about the second uh part that is called as the AIA Frederick Axia right so let&amp;#39;s talk about this disease now so this is basically autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which there is trinucleotide repeat right and that trinucleotide repeat is called as GAA right so basically we have chromosome number nine right and in that we have a gene that is called as the fexin gene right that CS for fexin fexin Gene right and basically this this is going to form the um A protein that is called as fexin right and what it does okay this is going to you know bind the iron right bind the iron right this is present within the mitochondria mitochondria right so um when there is decreased because of the trinucleotide repeat there&amp;#39;s defective you know retraction production right so there will be decreased function of this and you know Iron binding will won&amp;#39;t be happen and this lead to De degeneration of the neurons right okay so um because of the fex gene defect so there will be decreased production of Rin and there will be decreased binding of the iron and within the mitochondria so this is going to cause a degeneration of the neurot many neur tracts right so first one is called as the cortical spinal tract right if um right another one is peripheral nerves are involved basically the dorsal root ganglions right these are involved and there will be absent deep tendon reflexes right okay so uh there will be dorsal column involved right loss of prop perception PTV means prop perception two point discrimination and vibration this is function of dorsal column so these function will be invol lost in these patients and another one is that another tract that is involved that is called a Spinell tract right so there will be imbalance and incoordination in these patients when dorsal column is involved so we&amp;#39;ll see Axia in these patients right Axia in these patients so death is almost uh you know by 50 years and this is mostly due to the cardiomyopathy that is called as the hypertrophy cardiomyopathy right hypertrophy cardiomyopathy right and mostly these kids you know they present with the kyphoscoliosis Kyo scoliosis and they have you know some other features like um hammer to pavas hammer hammertoes pavis right okay so any patient that is presenting you know uh having kyos scoliosis and have you know pascavis and hemos and um uh he&amp;#39;s uh that patient is uh we if we check the um that patient is presenting with the muscular weakness and if we check the um reflexes right if we check the features of the upper motor and lower motor and both are both of them are present within this um individual so we&amp;#39;re going to think that the patient is having Fric attacks here right okay so we&amp;#39;ll have the dorsal root if uh dorsal root can get involvement right so because of that there will be absent deep reflexes right so that&amp;#39;s all about theic attex here now let&amp;#39;s talk about Subacute combined degeneration right all right so the the this happens because of the deficiency of the vitamin that is called as vitamin B12 right also known as Calamine right and it is co-actor for you know methin synthesis syes methine synthes enzyme right so risk factors is vegetarian any patient is have you know um sometimes you know D Pho Lum that also need leads to the um this deficiency of vit B12 so if we check the uh we get the blood CP we&amp;#39;re going to see the MC will will be raised right so it will be raised so SB hemoglobin will be down mean carpus volume will be up and hemoglobin will be decreased so this we&amp;#39;re going to categorize it as megaloblastic anemia right so basically what happens you know there&amp;#39;s increased production of meth methy melany coenzyme right and which damages the Ming sheet right if we you know there was a um um a process in which you know fatty acids are um you know moved to the uh TCS cycle right you know that process let me you know draw it here uh that you know fatty acids so the fatty acids right they you know are broken down into methy melany COA right then this methy melon COA is going to need B12 right and methy mile COA mutas enzyme right and this is going to you know convert this methy mile into suxy COA suy COA and and this suin Al Co a is if him if B6 is available this is going to get converted into him right if it is not available so it will be moved to TCS cycle right so if there&amp;#39;s deficiency of B12 we have increased amount of methy melon Alco and this is going to damage the moin sheet right so this is going to cause a demolation right so let&amp;#39;s just move on to the next page and let&amp;#39;s see what it says right so there will be you know caros spinal pathway is involved in these patient along with that we&amp;#39;ll have the dorsal column involved in these patients and we will have the spinos serella you know tracks these are involved in these patients so we&amp;#39;ll have this one dorsal column and we have the lateral um cortical spinal tracts right and along with that we have the spinal spinothalamic tract is involved and sometimes you know an T hor also involved so we&amp;#39;ll have the lower motor neuron features in these patient right so when when the corticospinal fibers involved so we&amp;#39;ll have the upper motor type of neuron leans and we have when peripheral nerves are involved so we will have the lower motor neuron type of Lans so if this represents the anterior horn cells when the dorsal column is B we&amp;#39;ll have the prop perception two point discrimination vibration or lost in these patients along with that that these patients are going to have the axate because of the loss of the dorsal column right they they going to have the paresthesias right okay so these are the features of the we&amp;#39;re going to get the for investigation we have we can check the serum B12 and methyl melony enzyme Co enzyme and sorry methy melony COA um if which if it toxicity is in if if its level is increased in the blood so we&amp;#39;re going to think the patient is having the B12 deficiency so we need to just replace this B12 so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s all about the Subacute combined degeneration right so let&amp;#39;s move on to the next topic and the last topic so we have the M pneumonic right so in which we&amp;#39;re going to see the um mixed upper motor and lower motor neuron type of Lans m stands for motor neuron disease right we are done with that and all of these three will have sensory features as well right so a stands for Fric AIA Subacute combined degeneration right and T stands for Tavis dellis right so let&amp;#39;s talk about Tavis D cellus in which we&amp;#39;re going to see the upper motor neuron features lower motor neuron features and dorsal column involvement right sensory involvement so let&amp;#39;s talk about tab Dells so this you know this is because of the tertiary syphus right so um this is caused by tertiary syphus that is called as neuros right basically it causes the vasculitis of the Vasa nervos that supplies the you know nerves right so the these are the this is going to cause end ortis oblu right so uh when it causes the vasculitis of the vas nervos so there will be degeneration demolation of the dorsal column and corticospinal tracts right so there will be degeneration of dorsal column corticos minor tracts and peripheral nerves right along with that will have the involvement of spino thymic tracts right so this is going to cause degeneration and demolation of neurons right okay so so in these patients we can see the uh we&amp;#39;re going to see the progressive Axia in these patient because of the involvement of dorsal column Progressive Axia right all right so so when spinothalamic tract is involved we&amp;#39;ll have the features like imbalance in these patients imbalance and incoordination right so we&amp;#39;re going to have the inex here along with that so um these features will be with that of lightning pens like Bol CR blue right this is also associated with the Char quat joint charat joint that what we see in the diabetic patients as well right because of neuropathy right uh char joints actually these are the deform joints right deed joints and along with that we&amp;#39;re going to see aroy Robertson people in these patients right so we&amp;#39;re going to treat the syphilis in the treatment is the treatment of syphilis so that&amp;#39;s all about the tabis dellis so I have completed this pneumonic that is M pneumonic right all right so now our next topic is the muscular weakness right approach to flaccid muscular weakness all right so that&amp;#39;s all for today right",

    "transcript": "(water swishing) I constantly feel an urgency to do things now while I still have the ability. And also, just to do something huge. I don&amp;#39;t wanna sit around in my life, and wait for it to pass me by. I have an urgency to go out there and grab what I can, and this is one of those opportunities to grab this huge epic journey for myself and for many other people. Use the epic. I stole that from Mike. That&amp;#39;s awesome. (laughing) Have you found yourself at all yet, dreaming about the finish line? (&amp;quot;Varuo&amp;quot; by Sigur Ros) There have been days that I&amp;#39;ve just said, Kyle stop. His motto that makes me crazy is, it&amp;#39;s not supposed to be easy. And that makes me crazy because he&amp;#39;s my son, and I want something in his life to be easy for him. So far I haven&amp;#39;t found it, but you know, some of it&amp;#39;s his own doing. (laughing) We have one of those brother relationships that was the, I&amp;#39;m gonna punch you in the face, kind of relationships. I got a scar on my head from him throwing a Game Boy game and hitting me right in the forehead. He&amp;#39;s got a strong will to him. I just wish he could... Still have a meaningful life, and do... Things that mean a lot to him. It never really hit me how... Serious it was. It didn&amp;#39;t matter who told me what was gonna happen to Kyle... Stupid. Yup. All right, here we go. We&amp;#39;re gonna try and catch some speed here. It&amp;#39;s the last run of the day, but we&amp;#39;re not supposed to say that, because that usually means you get hurt. But anyway, let&amp;#39;s have some fun. In the time leading up to when he was actually diagnosed, probably several years prior to that, I&amp;#39;d always been his baseball coach, little league coach. He was a pitcher then, and actually was a very good baseball player, and I started noticing that he was missing ground balls, he couldn&amp;#39;t get the ball over the plate, and he also had a little bit of like, a tremor. ♪ Feelin&amp;#39; scared today ♪ ♪ Write down I am okay ♪ ♪ Hundred times the doctors say ♪ ♪ I am okay ♪ ♪ I am okay ♪ They finally did the genetic test, where they took some of his blood, sent it to a lab, and at that point, although we didn&amp;#39;t know it, he had suspicions that it was Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. And when it came back, he called us into the office, and basically just told us what the diagnosis was, and we asked a lot of questions, and he really didn&amp;#39;t give us any help. He kinda gave us a webpage and said, you know, see you later, so it was pretty devastating. Of course I started looking on the internet to see exactly what we were dealing with. And basically it said that it was a degenerative disease, it was mainly diagnosed in younger children, so his was kinda unique in that he was older when we finally diagnosed it, and that it was fatal. The secret of the messy hairdo, you gotta make it look like you didn&amp;#39;t do your hair in the morning, you know? That&amp;#39;s the secret. Kyle had onset of symptoms at age 18, and he&amp;#39;s still able to walk with some assistance. He uses a wheelchair more for independence, and safety and to get around easier. Somebody like Brianne, she had onset at a much earlier age. She required use of a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and now she needs help with all of her activities of daily living, bathing, eating, dressing, and her speech is very affected, and so, it&amp;#39;s very difficult to understand her. And she also has significant loss of vision and hearing at this point. We&amp;#39;re recording. All right. You gotta scoot your head over for a second. All right, here we are. This is Brianne, once again. We are in Trucky at the FA ski weekend. We&amp;#39;re just having a lot of fun together, and here&amp;#39;s another perspective on FA from Brianne. Not so (mumbled). Not so what? What was that word? Phili, I can&amp;#39;t say it. (laughing) You know what I mean. While the neurological aspects of Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia are easy to see when you meet somebody with the condition, there&amp;#39;re other really serious complications of the disease that you can&amp;#39;t see. The most serious is heart disease, and the heart in FA is affected in almost everyone. But about a third of people with FA develop a really severe form of heart disease, called cardiomyopathy, and that cardiomyopathy is present in children, and it gets progressively worse, and individuals die by the age of 25 to 30 years of age of heart failure. They have a rule at my house... Don&amp;#39;t tell dad... &amp;#39;Cause I didn&amp;#39;t handle it well. We were told that Erin had Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia... And that it was not good, it was very rare, and there was no cure. So we needed some time in the doctor&amp;#39;s office to... Pull ourselves together &amp;#39;cause Erin was in the waiting room, and she was just a little girl, she was only 12. My wife and I, it was the... Worst time in our lives. I remember my wife telling me, long before I met Kyle that there was this kid that was gonna be on T.V., that he rides a trike. This kid from California. She said his name, I think I saw a clip on our local news. It was Kyle. Pat and I are always looking for inspirational stories, and inspirational people, and they&amp;#39;re out there. And a lot of time, we look cross country to find. You&amp;#39;re here in our town, and you&amp;#39;re doing this, and you&amp;#39;re taking off-- So you get on your bike. Yeah, and then I&amp;#39;ll be gone. Which is in June, and we wanna talk about that here in a second, but just real quick, on Saturday you&amp;#39;ve got kind of a local ride, correct? Right, yeah, it&amp;#39;s called Ride a Taxi in North Cal, and it starts in Fulsom. The main event is a 100 mile bike ride in two days, so it&amp;#39;s 50 miles a day. On the first day we also have 10 and 20 mile options. We kinda span the spectrum of abilities, and get anyone who wants to come out and ride to ride with us. Riding my bike translates into getting people excited about what they could do, and motivated to raise funds, and we all raise funds together. That fuels the research for someone to be able to look into the microscope, and know what&amp;#39;s going on in there. And then that turns into clinical trials, where the patients participate in clinical trials, and that pushes a drug further along, and then eventually... Those clinical trials will lead to an approval of a drug, which will lead to a treatment for people with FA. And holy cow, it all starts with riding a bike. That&amp;#39;s pretty cool. Let&amp;#39;s start with everybody&amp;#39;s name. Do you wanna start? Yeah, Dylan Helms. I&amp;#39;m Jennifer Helms. Jason Helms, and this is Sienna Helms. Dylan has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and that was actually diagnosed when he was about four, and at the time, nobody really considered Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia, they thought that we were just dealing with the heart issue, and... About a year after that when things were continuing to get worse, as far as the energy level, and the walking and the running, we went back to Seattle Children&amp;#39;s Hospital, and they ran a whole bunch of tests at that point, and Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia was one thing that they tested for, and that was... That was how the diagnosis came about. When they told us that that&amp;#39;s what it was, all I didn&amp;#39;t wanna hear was that it was progressive, and yeah, that&amp;#39;s... When we started to learn more about it, because it was progressive, and it is progressive. Once we found out the diagnosis about Dylan, we opted to have Sienna tested, and she also has Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. (slow music) At first I was just trying to raise money and awareness. When I realized that people were starting to look to me for inspiration, I told myself, you need to do something crazy. You need to do something so undeniably huge, that no one would even believe it was possible. 800 miles longer than the Tour De France. Voted the world&amp;#39;s toughest event. Through the desert, over the mountains, and across America&amp;#39;s heartland. Every year, cyclists from all over the world descend on ocean side California to prove themselves in the race across America. Cyclists must traverse 3,000 miles across 12 states, and climb over 170,000 vertical feet, from ocean side to Annapolis in nine days. The clock never stops. (laughing) Well, I guess it&amp;#39;s just kind of the next step, it&amp;#39;s... It&amp;#39;s another one of those darn ideas of his. (laughing) You&amp;#39;re an idiot, you&amp;#39;re crazy, and I really meant it, it wasn&amp;#39;t joking. Like, I was like, there&amp;#39;s no way you can do that. Kyle and I had talked about putting together this big event, and he started talking to me about Race Across America, and in this initial conversation, it was a matter of, he was going to get on a team, and he was talking to me because he wanted to know if I would recommend Mike. And I said, okay, what&amp;#39;s the idea? And he said, it&amp;#39;s a race across the United States... On our bikes. And I said, okay, how long&amp;#39;s this gonna take us? And he said, well, our time limit is nine days, so we have to do it in nine days. And I thought to myself, that&amp;#39;s crazy. I reached out to John Lockwood, and asked him if he wanted to do this crazy ride in like always, John said yes. This is gonna be a challenge, bring it on. But with Kyle&amp;#39;s enthusiasm, optimism, and just go get it attitude, he had me sold immediately. It kinda works non stop, somebody always has to pedal, we knew some basics. Exactly how it was gonna break down, and how much I was gonna do, and how much, I didn&amp;#39;t know. But he assured me that we would have a team that was strong, and we would have a support group that was committed. As soon as I heard they were looking for volunteers, I&amp;#39;m saying well, geez, okay, I don&amp;#39;t qualify, all I can do is, I can change a flat tire on a bicycle, but I don&amp;#39;t know what I can do, but geez, I&amp;#39;d love to be selected to be on the team. I had no clue what I was getting into. Teams consist of four riders, and a support crew. The whole team will ride 350 to 500 miles per day. The riders are split into teams of two, and race in relay format. The riding team consists of two follow vans. While one rider is on the road followed by a support van, the other rider waits ahead to continue the relay. The strategy of who races when and how long, depends on the strengths of the team members and the terrain. Riders must ride a set path, or face disqualification. The relay teams take shifts, never sleeping for more than four hours. While one team is riding, the other team is resting in an RV, and speeding ahead to prepare for the next leg. The support crew handles all of the logistics, food, fluids, navigation, clothing changes, medical needs, and bike repairs, so that the racers can focus on racing. So Mike, after the informational seminar, what do you think about RAAM? Epic. Wow. (laughing) It was a lot. I&amp;#39;m super pumped. And nervous, all at the same time. Here we go. You look good, man. My shirt, I got all the wrinkles out, right? &amp;#39;Cause I ironed the collar. Nice, nice, your collar looks magnificent. Thank you. I was pretty fearful, just &amp;#39;cause I hadn&amp;#39;t trained as much as the Mikes and Johns, you know? They were ready to go. And probably the most prepared. I would do 100 mile rides on the weekends. My goal was to put about 250 to 300 miles a weekend, and I felt that if I could do that consistently, I would build up some endurance. The challenge was at the end of each week, I felt like, okay, I rode 300 miles this week, I&amp;#39;m gonna ride 300 miles in 24 hours for RAAM. We&amp;#39;re countin&amp;#39; down for RAAM. What do you think, Sean? I think I should be doing this a lot more than I have been. Yeah. But I&amp;#39;m excited, it&amp;#39;s gonna be a good race. Yeah, I think it... Really, I think it needs to be the first thing we think about when we wake up. The race. And the last thing we think about when we go to sleep. I think that should be the thing we think about when we&amp;#39;re eating, when we&amp;#39;re working. I think it feels like it kinda has been for me. Good, me too. Mostly. You don&amp;#39;t wanna go into RAAM with, I&amp;#39;d say anything more than the most minor medical problems, because RAAM is hard enough without starting off with a physical disability, but I&amp;#39;ve always thought that the brain will push you beyond what your body can do. There&amp;#39;s been stories of people in war, and they&amp;#39;re basically awake two or three days, and you can&amp;#39;t do that in real life. Your body&amp;#39;s telling you stop this crap, stop it, and your brain says, keep on doing it. But you&amp;#39;ve gotta be in some kind of physical shape, or you won&amp;#39;t make it at all. You don&amp;#39;t get out of California. But the brain can overrule to a certain extent, and I don&amp;#39;t know where that extent is. You gotta have both. Keep getting little gnats in my mouth. I love it. There&amp;#39;s these two guys, they can&amp;#39;t hardly walk, in this incredible, the hardest race in the world. Everything&amp;#39;s easy for us, everything we do is easy. If you have FA, nothing&amp;#39;s easy. We want the entire world to know about this disease. We want the entire world to know that people are living in the shadows of this disease, because it&amp;#39;s just not known. And then by finishing, that&amp;#39;s all I expect to accomplish, a finish. And I think that alone will be significant and great for me personally, and for this team, and for all other FA patients around the globe. Is it safe to say this&amp;#39;ll be the toughest thing physically you&amp;#39;ve ever accomplished in your life. Absolutely, hands down the toughest thing. I haven&amp;#39;t done that much, you know. (laughing) I am going to have taken away an epic adventure. Pretty much the biggest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever done in my life. I look at my teammates, Kyle and Sean, and I&amp;#39;m just humbled by what they face in their lives, and the challenges they face. And I look at them, and they&amp;#39;re both incredible, both mentally and physically, and it really helps hold me accountable to what&amp;#39;s important in my life, and that&amp;#39;s my health. This race was an opportunity for me to really be able to focus on my health, and to be able to get into the physical shape it&amp;#39;s gonna take in order to complete this race. And to make sure that I can positively contribute to the team. Thank you to the team and the crew for letting me be a part of this. And... Let&amp;#39;s do this. Okay, now we have team 426, team FARA. This is Kyle, Sean, John and Mike! (crowd cheering) FARA, FARA, FARA, FARA, FARA. Okay, their charity&amp;#39;s hard to read. They&amp;#39;re raising money for Friedreich&amp;#39;s Ataxia Research Alliance, FARA, that&amp;#39;s the name, FARA. It is a debilitating, life shortening degenerative neuro muscular disorder, and they&amp;#39;re raising money to fight that. Thank you. (crowd cheering) It says here Kyle lives with this disease. He&amp;#39;s riding a specially designed bicycle just for this race, let&amp;#39;s hear it for him! (crowd cheering) Three, two, one, have fun, team FARA, we will see you in Annapolis!

Mechanic Mike, you&amp;#39;re the man. All the credit. All right, brother. Are you stoked for this glass elevator, or what? Can&amp;#39;t wait. You&amp;#39;re gonna get this mile. Yeah yeah! As we were planning the course, and which team was gonna be on the road and which legs, who was gonna start, we started plotting out how the transitions would work, and we realized that we were coming up to the glass elevator, which is a 4,000 foot descend over a couple short miles. I raised my hand and said, guys, please, give me the descent, I&amp;#39;ll crush it, I&amp;#39;ll tear it up, give it to me. And although there was some contention around who would ride the glass elevator, they granted that leg to me. And that was awesome, because I love descending, I love speed, and it was me against the mountain. I said, John, I want you to take it easy down this hill, it&amp;#39;s all downhill, it&amp;#39;s like four miles downhill. I said, I want you to take it easy, go slow. We don&amp;#39;t want any accidents, just take it easy. He takes off... And he flew, he just flew. As we made the transition at the top of the glass elevator, it was the most epic scene I have experienced in cycling to that point. And that was looking across the desert, and being able to see what felt like forever. And as the blue sky melted into the orange and yellowish desert, it was awesome. We were descending at about 42 miles an hour on a pretty narrow twisty road, and I was so full of adrenaline and endorphins, I couldn&amp;#39;t brake, I just kept going, and tried to pedal faster, and I remember distinctly passing our follow car who was in front of us filming me from the front. Passed him, there was a car in front of that, and they kept yelling at me, slow down, slow down, but there&amp;#39;s no way, I tried to slow down, I wasn&amp;#39;t even slowing down, the brakes were not working. So I figured, to heck with it, just keep going. John is somewhere up there. He is hauling butt, and the follow van is having trouble keeping up with him. So we&amp;#39;re picking up some time on this downhill here, because John is a crazy animal. I said, John, how fast were you going? He said, &amp;quot;I was going 60.&amp;quot; I said, well I thought I asked you to go slow, he said, &amp;quot;I was, I wanted to go 70.&amp;quot; Sick! That was the best thing I&amp;#39;ve ever done on a bike. So awesome. Everyday I see Dylan fall. Everyday I see a loss of function. But there&amp;#39;s hope, there&amp;#39;s hope. That&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re here. What would you guys say to people watching this movie about FA? What would you like people to hear? That everyone with... FA... Can have a wheelchair. People with FA can&amp;#39;t run as fast as people without FA, and that we usually fall down... And they don&amp;#39;t. What can you do though? Well, we can race in wheelchairs. Mm-hmm, and bikes. Yeah. (&amp;quot;Shirt&amp;quot; by The Belle Brigade) When we were going through Monument Valley, was driving, I think I was following Kyle. Woo-hoo! ♪ I am dry, I&amp;#39;m your shirt ♪ ♪ And I&amp;#39;ve been hung out on a line ♪ We had to stay behind Kyle 24 seven because of his recumbent bike.

And sat with the geneticist for an hour who explained to me what I was up against. I was there alone, so I was just trying to absorb everything. And when I left, I got back to where the elevator was, and of course, right next door were stairs. And I pushed the button for the elevator, and I was waiting... And it dawned on me, I said, you know, there&amp;#39;s stairs right across the way, and it&amp;#39;s only three floors. And it wasn&amp;#39;t so much that I was lazy, or anyhting like that, it was just convenience, I always took the elevator. And it dawned on me at that point, that doctor that I just sat down with for an hour, was telling me that a day will come that I may not be able to do that, or I won&amp;#39;t have the option, but that I&amp;#39;ll be stuck in the elevator unable to handle the stairs. So without hesitation, I said, I&amp;#39;m taking the stairs. And so I took the stairs down to my car, and I sat in my car trying to figure out what I&amp;#39;m doing, and what to do with it. And over the course of a couple years now, or three years, that&amp;#39;s evolved into what Kyle mentions is a part of what my purpose is. And so one of the reason I&amp;#39;m doing it, obviously is for personal challenge. I&amp;#39;ve been told that I won&amp;#39;t be able to do a lot of things in the future, and I&amp;#39;m okay with that when that comes, but there&amp;#39;s no reason why I can&amp;#39;t do things now. So I&amp;#39;ll do everything I possibly can to push the limits, push the envelope, whatever cliche phrases are out there. I&amp;#39;m going to grab the bull by the horns, and I&amp;#39;m going to show this bull that it&amp;#39;s picked the wrong body. Give me your victory pose. What? Your victory pose. Awesome. When an individual is diagnosed with FA, it&amp;#39;s such a lonely feeling. Most people have never heard the words Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. And so, personally when I was diagnosed, it was a really lonely feeling. I felt like me and my family were the only ones who&amp;#39;d ever heard of this disease. Based on the incidence of Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia, we know that there should be five to 6,000 people living with the disease in the United States. Currently we&amp;#39;re in contact with about 1,200 of them. This means that 80% of individuals living with FA are dealing with this disease alone. Kieth had been in the hospital for on and off for six months, mostly on, and with brief intervals being sent home on increasing levels of medication to keep his heart functioning, and on the final discharge the young doctor came up to us and gave us the final package of medications that would be intravenously injected. And he said, &amp;quot;Make sure this is hooked up on the way home. Your son could die on the drive home.&amp;quot; At that time when Kieth was diagnosed, there was no research, there were no support groups for patients, there was no awareness of Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia, there was no funding. Ron and Rachel saw this as an opportunity. FARA is the Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia research alliance. It was the organization that my wife, Rachael, and I cofounded in 1998, one year after our son, Kieth, was diagnosed. The first FARA symposium, it changed my life, and my wife&amp;#39;s life, as well as Erin&amp;#39;s life... Forever. Just, we had some hope. We walked into the place, three people alone, sat at a table by ourselves, seemed like everybody else knew each other. Erin and I are not shy people, my wife is. But at the end of that night, Erin was off mingling with everybody her age there, and we felt like we were back with family. So from the beginning of the meeting, being alone, sitting together alone, to walking away with friends for life, including Kyle... It was great. This letter that I just read before this shift was from a family friend who&amp;#39;s been supporting us through the rides and they weren&amp;#39;t even cyclists a couple years ago, and now they&amp;#39;re out doing centuries, and doing all these crazy bike rides, because of what we&amp;#39;re doing, and... They just said that... It inspires them to push themselves... Because of what we&amp;#39;re doing. And that pushes me even further. So, it&amp;#39;s a circular process, or something where, you know, I push hard, people support me, and that makes me push even harder. You guys just passed at a time station, I believe. Well, it&amp;#39;s hard to imagine how you could be pushing any harder than this. (laughing) That&amp;#39;s a good point. Yeah boy, yeah boy!

Yeah but once you get those endorphins going on those descents, you don&amp;#39;t wanna stop. I mean, like when I stopped under files miles, I&amp;#39;m like, man, I wanna keep going, but your shoulders, just the lactic acid builds up, and you&amp;#39;re holding on for dear life, and you&amp;#39;re trying to squeeze the break levers as hard as you possibly can at the same time.

All right, here we go. Go get &amp;#39;em, baby. Nice close, John. All right, Kyle, go get &amp;#39;em buddy. Good times. Hey, sir. You know, I had a wonderful, meaningful conversation with one of our crew members last night, and I learned his two sons, his only two sons are both affected with FA, and... Myself desiring to be a father, and to raise children, it really broke my heart to... Communicate, just to hear what he&amp;#39;s dealing with, and what his sons are dealing with, and I think that this disease is all about the heart, and I think we&amp;#39;re all here because we have tremendous heart, and we&amp;#39;re here to make a difference. And that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m here. I&amp;#39;m here to help, and I&amp;#39;m here to finish, and I&amp;#39;m here to tell a story. Enjoy the ride, man. I&amp;#39;ll try. Not many people could ever do this. Atta boy, Sean. Good job, Sean. Tough climb. All right, Sean. I got you. Go, Mike, whoo! Get to the van. Nice job, bud. Yeah, Sean. Okay, Mike, here&amp;#39;s the bike. Oh yeah, sorry, man. I&amp;#39;ll get it. Yeah, we got it. That woulda sucked. Oh my gosh. That&amp;#39;s the worst part I think. You just biked up the Rockies. Are we in the Rockies? We&amp;#39;re out of them. I&amp;#39;m glad I didn&amp;#39;t know that. That&amp;#39;s freakin&amp;#39; awesome. We summited the highest point, that was us. That&amp;#39;s right.\nwe got this. Yeah, man. That was the continental divide, and I don&amp;#39;t know the elevation. High, it was probably like... 40,000 feet or something ridiculous. Close to Mount Everest. Right up there by Everest. So what we&amp;#39;ve got here. It makes your poop green. It takes like crap. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure we were taking too many to start out with. Definitely. (laughs) They&amp;#39;re just like extra little supplements that... You might not get in foods, or foods we&amp;#39;d be eating. Certain minerals and stuff. He takes a little bit of estrogen in one of this. No, they&amp;#39;re mostly just like, endurolytes, also something to help the muscles recover faster. (laughing) Careful. (slow jazzy music) Our theme today has reminded us that we&amp;#39;re all in this together in a lot of ways. And it always brings me back to Ron&amp;#39;s quote that we can all say in unison now together. Acting alone there is very little we can accomplish. Acting together there is very little we will not accomplish. And that was the central theme through every single presentation we heard today. The real backbone, the real spine of FARA, is the way we&amp;#39;ve built the patient community. All these patients began like we did in 1997, 1998, as isolated individuals. Not even knowing there were 15,000 FA patients like themselves around the world, not knowing that there were 5,000 or so American patients, not knowing that there was at least a handful of scientists devoting themselves to this disorder. So they felt isolated, they felt hopeless, they felt helpless. And so if you fast forward to today, those isolated, hopeless, helpless people, are now members of a huge FA family. They&amp;#39;re not hopeless, they&amp;#39;re confident. They&amp;#39;re not helpless, they know that what we&amp;#39;re all doing together will get us across the finish line. With the support we have from FARA, and the FARA family, and the doctors, and... Ron Bartek, these dedicated people, and then Kyle comes into the equation, and... Who woulda thought a guy that can&amp;#39;t even walk is gonna ride his bicycle across the United States? Gopher vehicle, we&amp;#39;re at the Shell station-- It&amp;#39;s crazy how you can support the cause just by...

And I&amp;#39;m going, okay, this is miserable. But, I guarantee, there&amp;#39;s plenty of people out there who are like, all right, if we knew what to do to cure FA, we would do whatever it takes. We would ride through Indiana at 3:30 a.m. in the pouring rain, any day, easily, no question, if that&amp;#39;s what it took to cure this disease. And so, I truly believe that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing out here tonight, is working towards a cure, and if this is what it takes, that&amp;#39;s a small price to pay. So we&amp;#39;ll get it done.

(thundering) Soaked. I think there are 100 reasons today why I&amp;#39;m doing RAAM. And... One of your other questions was, what have you gone through to get ready for this. And... Three months ago, my father passed away. I emailed him and my mom when this came up. I said, this is what we&amp;#39;re thinking about, what do you think? And later found out that my dad was so excited about the way I was facing the challenges in my life, and so excited about the opportunity to be a part of this team, and to race across America, that he went online to see how he could be involved, and... He found a category that he could race in. It was just for fun, obviously, he was dealing with cancer, he wouldn&amp;#39;t... He was in no position to do it, and he knew that, but the idea of it was so cool to him. And once he found out that I committed to doing it, he told everybody in his world. Everybody knew that Jack&amp;#39;s son was gonna do this. And I know he was proud just to watch. And so, another reason why I&amp;#39;m riding today, is to make sure that dream becomes a reality, whether he&amp;#39;s physically there to witness it or not. I know that... I&amp;#39;m making him proud, and to me that&amp;#39;s incredible important, and incredibly motivating. That was a long answer.

Not anymore. ♪ Shake it, fake it, stick with us ♪ ♪ I could see for miles, miles, miles ♪ During the last couple of weeks of Kieth&amp;#39;s life in the hospital and at home, he had lost a lot of his ability to verbally communicate. He could still work the keyboard somewhat, so he could type out messages. But then he started having me type messages to his friends in his name, and his speech was almost incoherent. You had to put your ear right next to his lips, and you had to know his speech, and his speech patterns to make out anything. So communication was largely non verbal, and very tender, and loving... And brave. He died very graciously. Having said marvelously warm and loving things to each of us individually. He was a fine young man. I was pissed at first, I was just pissed. When I would go to church, I used to scream, and say, give it to me, switch places, if you do this little miracle, then I will do everything. Give it to me, I&amp;#39;ve done everything I need to do, but now when I&amp;#39;ll go in, I&amp;#39;ll talk, like hey, come on, just a little miracle, you can do it. There are a lot of people in this world that deal with challenges. There are... A lot of people who live a life jeopardized by some sort of disease, or something unfortunate that they never asked for. And there&amp;#39;s nothing they can do to change it. And there&amp;#39;s something inside me that says, no matter what the issue, or concern, or disease, or dysfunction is, there&amp;#39;s a way to fight it. And there&amp;#39;s always hope. So for me, it&amp;#39;s a way to remind myself that there&amp;#39;s hope for me, there&amp;#39;s hope for Kyle, and 10,000 or so other FA patients in the U.S., and there&amp;#39;s hope for people that deal with all kinds of disease. I think what we&amp;#39;re doing, and on the open road, and in such a challenge, that&amp;#39;s really is where life is meant to be lived. And so, I&amp;#39;m doing it, because I think that&amp;#39;s where life is most lived. Dylan, do you remember what it&amp;#39;s like before you had a wheelchair?

    "transcript": "welcome you guys my name is Matt Flur and I&amp;#39;m fortunate enough to be presenting again this year with Beth hon and Jean Walsh fellow fa community members and both licensed social workers seeing yourself as the hero in your own story it&amp;#39;s called narrative therapy which can be a healthy way for us to see aspects of our own lives in a nonthreatening way today we&amp;#39;re going to talk about the hero&amp;#39;s journey and how it&amp;#39;s evident in our lives with he each of my co-presenters and I will send our talks around the central question that um we&amp;#39;ll ask you to think about and then we&amp;#39;ll open the question for anyone to think about after the talk so our point is that Heroes aren&amp;#39;t just fiction in movies and comics in in books or in stories we hope to show you how the Hero Journey applies to you hi my name is Elizabeth Hamilton and I want to ensure that we make sure that we&amp;#39;re taking care of ourselves during this time so as we talk today if things are triggering or they get to be too much or you need to kind of move feel feel free to pause this recording and take care of yourself so if you notice if your heart rate increases or you&amp;#39;re just starting to feel a little tense maybe take a break or take a pause because your care matters in all things hi there I&amp;#39;m Jean Walsh I am a social worker as Matt said but I&amp;#39;m also an fa patient I&amp;#39;ve had fa for about 4 40 years or I was diagnosed I should say we&amp;#39;re just going to have a strength based discussion because in in layman&amp;#39;s terms strengths are things that are really positive for you that are asset that help you along in your hero&amp;#39;s journey um who want to continue to build relationship ships with each other we importantly want to normalize the conversation around medal Health though this whole discussion is therapeutic and nature in that we&amp;#39;re giving you things to think about that you might be able to build from your strengths upon um this this session is definitely not in intended to replace therapy back to my friend Matt thank you Jean so again my name is Matt llor I was diagnosed with fa when I was 9 years old my grad school degree is in mental health counseling but after graduation I took a contract position writing as a patient colonist for friedrick texian news and that developed in a fulltime into a full-time role at its parent company Bion news where I currently serve as the associate director of patient engagement a Shameless plug if you like existential literary and psychologic and psychological musings on life with fa check out my column on fa news called little victories I will share how I relate to one of my favorite superheroes Spider-Man even though Peter Parker looks very heroic in the picture in front of us he didn&amp;#39;t always I&amp;#39;m sorry he didn&amp;#39;t start out that way and probably didn&amp;#39;t see himself as a hero just like me and and probably just like you as well back in high school I was beginning to feel the grip of f on my life I realized that I couldn&amp;#39;t hide from from getting more and more disabled which scared the crap out of me there&amp;#39;s no way I would have believed that one day I&amp;#39;d be co-presenting a breakout session on Mental Health at the fa Symposium often the Hero Journey is unpredictable I&amp;#39;m not patting myself on the back when I say the Hero Journey applies to all of us in the fa Community next slide so the hero&amp;#39;s the hero&amp;#39;s journey was first coined in the book the hero with the Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell in the 1940s the hero&amp;#39;s journey is a similar path that followed by mythological figures by superheroes and by literary characters without going into too much detail the Hero Journey can be summed up in three phases the inciting event or the the departure comprises the uncomfortable change that says us that sets us down New Path next in the conflict or the initiation when we confront the major challenge in our lives finally we have the resolution or the return that&amp;#39;s when we conf fund The Challenge and move and when we have F The Challenge and triumphantly return to our lives before the challenge confronted us but with do found bravery and wisdom this this is a really simplistic of few and there are many more steps in the Hero Journey so so if you&amp;#39;re interested in that I highly encourage you to check out camp book but recognizing the Hero Journey is cyclical and not linear is essential so what that looks like is that even when we feel like we&amp;#39;re back at the beginning and we should be over at something we&amp;#39;re just going through the process that&amp;#39;s just part of the journey and you&amp;#39;re still hero next slide now I&amp;#39;ll go back to Peter Parker or Miles Morales for you mon modern people the initiating incident was probably the spider M that was the world shattering in a ctable event that changed Peter&amp;#39;s life course and made him begin the Hero Journey in the fa world what is our culture adventor it&amp;#39;s not spider fight but it&amp;#39;s likely our fa diagnosis but again because the journey is cyclical that may not be the only exciting event we may feel ourselves begging the beginning over and over some some other inciting incidents in our lives may be adapting to new Walking Aid or dealing with symptom regression or finding ourselves frustrated at trying to exess treatment for our Fai it may feel like we&amp;#39;re beg in the beginning and we may feel like failures and even though the psycho is very frustrating it&amp;#39;s completely normal the cult to Adventure always take the wind out of our sales and makes us feel lost but it&amp;#39;s important to remember that you&amp;#39;re not alone when you&amp;#39;re feeling that way next slide it&amp;#39;s embarrassing how long it took me to recognize the power and the unity within the fa Community whether or not you count yourself bu friends at events like the EV Symposium or any fa events I want you to understand that you&amp;#39;re not alone that for the first time maybe you&amp;#39;re around people who completely understand what you&amp;#39;re going through feeling alone in the world with a is really common but it doesn&amp;#39;t need to be especially when you surround yourself among people who you know understand what it&amp;#39;s like so know that among the F Community you&amp;#39;re no longer a lone vigilante webslinger but you&amp;#39;re an Avenger around a their superpowered people next slide and now for the question at the heart of my presentation how can we remain steadfast and be okay with f remaining steadfast means not being swayed by what we&amp;#39;re feeling in the moment but having the same outlock on on bad days as on good days the fa committee the fa committee has an overwhelming task we have to be okay despite the joyous ODS and devastating but unfortunately common loads of our disorder in that case remaining resilient and steadfast is indeed heroic remaining steadfast at all times is almost impossible at least it is for me but I think it&amp;#39;s an important goal that we have to set for ourselves it&amp;#39;s especially important to remain steadfast right now in this pretty chaotic time in the life that the fa Community when treatments are finally available to us or let me say some of us but it can be overwhelming we have worry about the cost the availability and even the potential side effects of any treatment that may come out even aside from those worries life with have f General can be quite overwhelming and unfortunately there is no objective way to remain step fast so there&amp;#39;s no key I could tell you that this is what you have to do you have to find out for yourself what makes you feel alive and happy even amidst a face highs and lows Beth will give us some tips on self-reg relation next and who can you turn to for support both friends and family and for professional for professional guidance Jean will give us some insight on relationships please think about this and ask yourself the question because we&amp;#39;ll ask we&amp;#39;ll leave asking you to think about that what will it take for you to be okay and remain steadfast in the life of that next slide I&amp;#39;ll wrap up my section with a quote by Christopher Reeves who was Superman himself he became paralyzed and wi man in 1995 a hero is a an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles persevering and enduring can be another way to say remaining steadfast for me that can look like keeping up with exercise and staying Physically Active finding time for me to write and finding ways to stay productive also connecting with friends both within and outside of the fa Community Ang in closing my section if you&amp;#39;re like Spider-Man and like me you don&amp;#39;t see yourself as a hero but maybe we should for superheroes to saing the Looking Glass now I give it over to Beth who reminds us that we&amp;#39;re all a little mad around here thank you so much Matt I really appreciate that introduction and the hero&amp;#39;s journey conversation which has just been very empowering I know for me to hear if you want to hear a little bit more from Matt about the heroes Journey please check out the two disabled dudes episode where Matt lefur is on talks about the hero&amp;#39;s journey he might not promote himself as much as I will promote him but it is incredibly powerful and I encourage you to check it out so my name is Elizabeth Hamilton and I am a licensed social worker but more importantly I am the mom of an Neer my daughter is 11 years old and she was diagnosed when she was eight and so when we started having this conversation around the hero&amp;#39;s journey and um kudos to to Jee Walsh who said hey I don&amp;#39;t really do superheroes but I love other things it made me really think about What story do I connect with and what Heroes Journey do I connect with and for me Alice and Wonderland or Alice stepping through the Looking Glass really resonated because there&amp;#39;s so many times I find in this fa Journey that I am chasing the White Rabbit whether it is balance whether it&amp;#39;s a cure peace parenting well um I find myself running down a lot of rabbit holes so when we think about going down that journey of the rabbit hole and that journey of Shifting lives my perspective has changed so much and it continues to change and adapt and so for me I&amp;#39;m constantly recalibrating which is why when um I started working for Bio news and writing for fa news um bio news is the parent company for fa news I really thought about naming it recalibrating because I&amp;#39;m always rethinking how I look at the world and look at life because things did shift for our family and for myself so for me I spend so much time trying to understand I don&amp;#39;t understand medical terminology so I find myself struggling to understand the research the doctors my child my nonf impacted child myself and at times it really feels like I&amp;#39;m learning another language our brains though are incredible and we process so much information in fact we&amp;#39;re always thinking about things so right now you are looking at the slide and you&amp;#39;re listening to me but you also could be thinking about what you&amp;#39;re going to cook for dinner tonight are the groceries that you need to purchase or what&amp;#39;s on your to-do list for later today and so you&amp;#39;re processing that information and also listening to me it&amp;#39;s incredible the amount of things that your brain can consume and come to snap judgments and we&amp;#39;re able to do that it&amp;#39;s a survival technique so let&amp;#39;s engage in just a quick example together and it&amp;#39;s not going to be the same as when I do it in person but just bear with me for a second and do it so I&amp;#39;m GNA ask you this question what color is this you&amp;#39;re going to say white right what do cows drink if you were like most people you now have said milk whether you said it out loud or in your head you snap to that decision very quickly this is white and cows obviously that&amp;#39;s milk we move to those spaces so quickly it&amp;#39;s really powerful and it&amp;#39;s a way of survival for us but the truth is cows don&amp;#39;t drink milk they drink water we also make those snap decisions when we talk about mental health or our struggles when I struggle with my mental health or my ability to regulate or my stress level or depression and I admit it and seek help that is not a form of weakness that&amp;#39;s a form of strength that&amp;#39;s me being honest so just as cows don&amp;#39;t drink milk even if we see the color white right before we&amp;#39;re asked that question it&amp;#39;s also not a deficit to seek help or to address our mental health it&amp;#39;s a sign of strength and I want us to rethink that especially as caregivers and as patients who are going through some challenging things so as I&amp;#39;ve had to rethink life I&amp;#39;ve had some things that I thought were going to be true in the parent Journey that are no longer true the future is different than what I would have originally thought and so I&amp;#39;m now rethinking what that Preferred Future and that preferred now is and it is better if I own that the roses are white than trying to paint them red because when I try to make things exist that do not exist anymore or want things to be a different way I really struggle with this thing we called self-regulation so this is why I have to talk a lot about mindfulness grounding and regulation a lot in my column because it is something that I struggle with I struggle when I get frustrated I struggle when I don&amp;#39;t self-care and then those triggers come in and I am not the preferred parent that I would like to be or the preferred person so I want to talk a little bit about the stress response and this chart is fake but the concept is real I stole the concept by Dr Bruce Perry if you want to read into his stuff he is a brilliant psychologist Neuroscience um Professor but has done a lot around trauma in the brain but if we think about for a non-trauma impacted person when you wake up and you don&amp;#39;t have that stimuli stressing you out your journey from the beginning here where you&amp;#39;re kind of calm and regulated to that stress response where you freak out right and we&amp;#39;ve all had those moments is much longer if you are a trauma impacted person you start higher if you are significantly impacted there is a very short distance between you&amp;#39;re waking in the day and hitting that point where you can no longer self-regulate or calm down I&amp;#39;m not sharing this because it&amp;#39;s a deficit for us I&amp;#39;m sharing this because I want us to to look at each other in spaces of Grace and understanding so that we recognize that we are all going through so much and our journey really requires a lot of self-a another way to explain this is a talk about your brain and I I borrowed this from Dr um seagull who really did this great hand model around the brain and it&amp;#39;s the best way for me to understand it because I need simplistic things to understand so if we think about your hand this is your brain stem right here in the middle your thumb would be your limbic system that&amp;#39;s your fight flight or free zone right we all have talked about it we&amp;#39;ve all experienced it but this is where your emotions are housed and this part of your brain is incredibly smart it was DEC Creed um in order for you to survive so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really smart with survival and getting your body to react quickly it&amp;#39;s not the best with complex conversations which is where we need your cerebral cortex or the fingers of your brain so when we&amp;#39;re nice and calm and regulated we are walking around like this right our cerebral cortex is engaged we&amp;#39;re all calm and we&amp;#39;re able to hear and respond in ways that um not only are healthy or helpful but sometimes appropriate right but it&amp;#39;s when we hit that stress response where our brain flips and our thinking brain shuts off and the survival smart part takes over survival smart does not mean good conversations right and we move into that fight fright flight or free zone I will tell you as a parent with a child with fa when I&amp;#39;m talking to medical professionals this part of my brain wants to take over it is not a good part of my brain to be interacting with people so what I have to do is constantly think about how can I stay calm how can I self regulate so the smart part of my brain is the part that&amp;#39;s interacting with people so what are some things that we can do to help self-regulate help stay calm help to take care of ourselves because we matter the first is around healthy relationships those are incredibly important and that discussion is coming movement movement really works one of the things that we used to say when we were working with providers who were going to work with kids who are trauma impacted was if you want that child to talk put them in your car and go for a long ride because when when we are moving and we&amp;#39;re moving alongside people we regulate we calm down and we connect so much better get yourself in a routine do something every day to take care of yourself it should be number one on your checklist have some self-awareness so when you are starting to get stressed out your shoulders are tensing up your breathing is getting shallow you know and you&amp;#39;re aware so you can pause and take care of you because you matter and the last piece is really around mindfulness being present to Here and Now one of the doctors we work with says you can&amp;#39;t parent in the past you can&amp;#39;t parent in the future you can only parent in the present you can also only live in the present too so try to stay where you&amp;#39;re at today so I want you to kind of walk away always providing yourself with some truth patience and Grace because that is critical in this journey knowing that we&amp;#39;re all little mat here around here and whatever way that looks like for you and so my question of what I would like people to think about is what is something that you can do that helps you what helps you feel grounded helps you feel calm and helps you regulate knowing what those tools are for you and what works for you is an incredibly important part of your journey and with that I will turn this over to my incredible colleague Jean Walsh um to talk to you about relationships thanks Beth um so I&amp;#39;m Jean wal this is me um as you as those of you who know the Lord of the Rings thing um you can recognize that Lord of the Rings is really were I identified with that story next slide please we your friendly panel and many social scientists think that romantic relationship is overemphasized so we&amp;#39;re going to focus on some other relationships today it&amp;#39;s easy for me to say that the Romantic relationship is overemphasized because for those of you who knew me I&amp;#39;ve been married for 28 years so um easy for me to say I get it but um if you can focus on stuff that&amp;#39; be great next slide as you can see one of my favorite Heroes is Legolas from lord of rings I admire and try to emulate his ability to be the hero one minute and the sidekick the next today we&amp;#39;re going to talk about two critical relation relationships one is our relationship with our doctor and other medical professionals and two is friendships next slide please let&amp;#39;s start with our medical professionals I don&amp;#39;t know about you but I always find myself super tense when I go to the doctor&amp;#39;s office even doctors I love so I&amp;#39;m trying really hard to bring the open brain that b talked to us about but um sometimes I don&amp;#39;t brain that brain I I&amp;#39;ve been a hundreds of doctors and diagnostic visits as many of you have many of these have been scary with life alterating Al altering diagnosis H handed out my initial diagnosis with pruy toxy can be summed up in this list fa no treatment no Care realair by 25 by 35 and for contacts I was 19 my day was supposed to be just starting out oh yeah if possible you should really want to take care of your feet next slide please what my feet how about my life not saying ignore anyone should ignore their feet but that wasn&amp;#39;t the problem in front of me and so so it was really insensitive my parents and I were zombies at that time we weren&amp;#39;t calling it um trauma but it definitely was trauma we were calling it shock next slide please my neurologist circa 1981 when I was dios superb diagnostician lovesy bedtime bedside Manor it is no wonder that I&amp;#39;m anxious going to the doctor my family and I were given the worst news of our lives at the doctor&amp;#39;s office I was n told to shut up as in this cartoon but I definitely was not listen to next slide please sounds familiar your story is probably a little different but also similar worst news of your life at the doctor&amp;#39;s office the doctor is being a good doctor by telling you the truth but it&amp;#39;s still the worst and traumatic news next slide please traumas at the doctor&amp;#39;s office is likely familiar to everyone with the fa diagnosis or an fa diagnosis for a loved one you may not feel you want to or should recognize our fa diagnosis as trauma but it is don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t diminish it recognizing it as such gives us power over the patient medical provider relationship maybe your diagnosis came with the awesome bedside manner and I hope it did I am not saying your doctor is intentionally inflicting trauma upon you I am saying that learning you or loved one who have fa is is a traumatic thing next slide please so how do we manage this critical relationship there are many anyways but this is how I do it I manage it by trying to be a good and likeable patient for those of you who know me that will be a shock not really sometimes I gloss over the hardships I have I almost always follow doctor&amp;#39;s advice I try to treat the doctor as a human being with the life outside of work and outside my trauma but you know when my brain is shut down as B told us about um it&amp;#39;s hard to hard to do that at the same time not complaining or glassing over things is something I&amp;#39;m trying to stop doing because the doctor can&amp;#39;t help me and he probably he or she probably won&amp;#39;t trust me if I don&amp;#39;t tell the truth I have a brutal disease and have had it for over 40 years is normal for me or any of us with the fa regardless of how long you&amp;#39;ve had it to have issues next slide please so I&amp;#39;m not the only one doing the good patient thing probably some of you are too trust is a fundamental component on both sides of the patient doctor relationship according to the literature I reviewed so when I don&amp;#39;t fully disclose what is going up for me I am not being transfer for my doctor it&amp;#39;s give and take relationship conversely when my primary care physician which this is actually real for me right now does not look up FAA I don&amp;#39;t find her competent or reliable and therefore trustworthy trust trust for you might Encompass more more than is here maybe you have your own unique items one thing you you probably want to think about after watching us is how do you manage the relationship with your medical provider for yourself or your loved one with fa next slide please so my favorite quote part of that big long quote is you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone because it reminds me of our beloved fa Community I hope you feel that way too trust is fundamental to friendships Also let&amp;#39;s take a mini very mini dive into friendships some of you may know that the Surgeon General has declared loneliness a public crisis well the anti doe to that is friendship next slide please it is not your imagination that friendship is more difficult for those of us with fa and our loved ones well there is no research bad specific to fa there&amp;#39;s a good bit into people with chronic disease and or disability so we know it&amp;#39;s harder and we have to make active decisions on how to spend our precious energy next slide please so how do we count counteract the fact that it&amp;#39;s so difficult it can be done next slide please here are some simple ways to nurture friendships remember when you&amp;#39;re helping people understand your not complaining you&amp;#39;re speaking the truth don&amp;#39;t forget the details so getting showered and ready to go out somewhere can be exhausting it can be overwhelming figuring out that the venue or the bathroom are accessible or maybe you&amp;#39;re like me and the background background noise makes a busy restaurant super hurt there are many more examples I&amp;#39;m sure you have some that are unique to yourself next slide please actually Jean can I interrupt and ask a question or make a statement so as I&amp;#39;m reading this and we&amp;#39;ve done this how many times together I thought about the fact that I have to think all the time because even though I have a child that has fa and struggles with different things I have to continue to Pivot to think about how to care for her but when you talk about helping your able-bodied um friends understand it shouldn&amp;#39;t be on you to explain that because it&amp;#39;s exhausting but at the same time I don&amp;#39;t know what I haven&amp;#39;t lived and so that&amp;#39;s just it really struck me and I just want to point it out is how important it is to continue to help us on understand and I appreciate that yeah it&amp;#39;s hard and um people have talked about this a lot of times in a lot of different context right we don&amp;#39;t know what it&amp;#39;s like to be a member of A different race or whatever but we can never we can never exactly know but we can certainly understand but our ability to understand rest upon people telling us what the issues are so it&amp;#39;s hard to be you know we have to walk the line a little bit and give people some Grace of just like I&amp;#39;m tired of explaining that I can&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t hear in a in a crowded restaurant or crowded space whatever it might be that&amp;#39;s excellent point and I just want to say friendships are super worth it um they give you a lot they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;re hard you have to work at them but they&amp;#39;re totally worth it and um for those of you that know Lord of the Rings um Sam on the left I can never tell my left or my right I have to leg my hands on the left here is pretty much Frodo&amp;#39;s sidekick throughout the whole journey but uh but froo could not have made his journey in The Lord of the Rings tail without Sam being there for him and carrying him when he needed to so back to my friend Matt all right thank you Jean I will just sum up our talk today with these uh weating our questions uh Spider-Man and I asked how can we be okay and remain steadfast with that then Alice asked what is something you do that helps you feel grounded helps you feel calm help to regulate and then legalist L let off with how do you manage your medical provider or your friend relationships these are all super important question that you guys have to think about so we ask you to reflect on them after this podcast and keep them in your mind think about them and um before I sign off I want to thank my friends Beth and Jean for doing this with me you guys are awesome and for all of you guys watching I want you to remember that U the reason we chose the topic the her journey is um because of you and that remember despite your

    "transcript": "I have a brief introductory talk because we have the members of the Hellenic Association for a Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia the carers the patients in Greece and abroad the members of the medical community researchers representatives of pharmaceutical companies France and all of you we would like to welcome you in this effort that we are doing at The Institute of pastel which we would like to thank for hosting us today is a day of Hope why because our patients from all over Greece whether they are together with us in this hall or through the internet after many years that they were expecting for the highlighting of their disease this becomes a reality the success of today&amp;#39;s event proves that with Collective work effort targets we can achieve a lot through the brief period of time from our foundation our association managed to highlight increase Ataxia but also in South and Eastern Europe is a framework of an ambitious but at the same time realistic action plan we have put certain drugs reductions which we Implement step by step our association has developed successfully the internal and international cooperations and it is a full member of your Ataxia member of the association of patients in Greece of rare diseases our association also considers extremely significant the cooperation that it has developed in recent years with U.S research Ataxia Alliance which we would like to thank for their support in today&amp;#39;s event allow me to address our patients all over aggressive who most of them are at an advanced stage of their illness and as a result they cannot be with us here today I would like to address the guys in various saloniki healthy in the island of pakist the island of curfew commodity island of coast miraclean and Kanye also I would like to address all our patients their carers and parents who have enrolled in today&amp;#39;s conference and are following the confidence in more than 22 countries in the world Argentina Brazil Austria Belgium Canada Cyprus German recording in progress foreign because six to eight percent of people in Europe have a rare disease this reflects to 30 million citizens in the European Union we know these people we have to give some hope and our efforts converts towards this point of course we are not this illusioned we know that we have a very difficult road ahead of us we hope that we are very close to the first treatment and of the disease our job as representatives of the patient starts now since we have to begin so that this therapies will be available available and accessible to our patients both recent abroad we are sure that the state will stand by it to the rare patient and show their interest in equal opportunities to all the people I would like to thank all of you and without any further Ado let&amp;#39;s begin our conference [Music] minister of state to address the conference I I would like to thank you for the invitation to this first panic Hellenic conference from friedrich&amp;#39;s a taxi and wish good luck in this conference for the clinical and approval of the first drugs that are going to help towards this direction I have sent could sense a big message of Hope to all uh the citizens that they suffer from any kind of disease I would like to to talk to you about the Mrs Mr karadia&amp;#39;s contribution who is serving this purpose and my hope is that things will change to the best for the state mechanism who at some degree has made some steps forward in order to enhance the public policy for disability and I think it is a very good example of the horizontal policy of the state and it was the first public policy that the new government undertook in 2019 following the recommendations of the United Nations poor at the rights of disabled people and after systemic work we had the national action plan for a disabled people and it was put into public dialogue in 2020 and it constitutes a very detailed approach with six pillars 30 targets actions that have specific body of implementation specific budget and specific timetable of implementation we enhance all the practices into the other hand for the first time we have close together all the actions that have to do with disability with a central control system for the development of the action national action plan we have actions the activation of course of the coordinating mechanism in all regions and municipalities and Ministries there is a reference point for monitoring this action plan so that we can have the real owner of its body who is responsible and we set up the National Committee of accessibility the counseling body for the state from people from resend abroad of high Prestige that work with intensive uh rate in order to develop these policies we had a wide codification of all the circulars that have to do with this ability let me point out that we are talking about a field where the multi-lose was not a good example a huge effort that was concentrated in over 7000 pages so that its Endeavor is Vision will understand in a unified text the rights they have we already have the electronic platform of accessing Melody for all the buildings of public interest shows that on the first level we can record and second level to improve the accessibility of public buildings although already we have three thirty thousand five hundred buildings on this platform and we have regarded a relevant amount of money from The Recovery Fund so that we can work this institution we have the institutionalization of the first pilot program for the personal carer with 1 000 positions and beneficiaries don&amp;#39;t who is a certified the disability of at least 67 percent for the region of vatica and then for the rest of Greece we have the inclusive um the inclusive uh approach in education and on another level we have employed uh 4 000 pieces for for students of special for special needs and problems so that we can have an essential educational policy for people with disabilities we concluded the national strategy of implementation and we will have the institutionalization policy and we have the unified page which is the the first accessible platform of the public Administration is certified with the highest degree 3A for with the rights of the people of disabilities and each and every person can have direct and without restrictions access and in the next period we have the unified card of disability the transfer of kepa into modern places in the peace and friendship Stadium and of course we have updating of the national action plan with new significant actions every society is judged with the respect that they show to the vulnerable citizens I think that is time we have inclusive policies in order to have a Society open and accessible to everybody thank you very much I hope you have a very fruitful conference with fruitful results thank you the state Minister and allow me to read the message of Mr plebris the minister for health honorable president dear ladies and gentlemen I would like to thank you for your invitation and I hope that you achieved the targets of the conference I feel a great pleasure that today I address this panhellenic conference as a disease causes the lack of taxes and autonomous movement the conference is a landmark for our country because it&amp;#39;s the first time in Greece the the issues that we are going to discuss are very impressive the researches and the clinical research give us the hope for this disease the people who suffer have the opportunity to speak in public for the problems they face and let us know the needs that they have it is important to listen to all the problems they have so that we can relieve them both from the other side of the state and science they are symbols of persistence and courage and we have to stand by them it is important to have such scientific initiatives information awareness exchangeable opinion education clinical research and direct communication with the people lead to the best service and better I would like to welcome all the speakers from Greece and abroad and the organizers that they have worked hard for the success of this conference I would like to address pressure this concurrence and I wish you every success athanasius Minister for health and let&amp;#39;s hope that the Ministry of Health will Embrace this initiative and will really stand by this patient now I will give the floor to the president of a neurologic society Mr Richards Professor with huge scientific background to talk to us about uh to address a conference their colleagues we are places good morning I am your voice professor of Neurology of the national capital district and University of Athens and president of the Hellenic neurological Society I addressed the initiative of the Hellenic Society for friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia for the organization of the first partic conference as a science is a neurologist I consider extremely important the public discussion that will promote the significance end of this rare disease and the urgent need in order to find treatment the presentation of modern scientific developments of the pioneering clinical trials that are taking place globally will offer new hopes to the presence that they have at least they suffer from this disease in order to have the best possible tackling of it now let&amp;#39;s give the floor to professional neurology Mr stefanis good morning you have the floor professional good morning I would like to thank for the invitation I would like to address this fantastic conferences it is the first meeting for friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia in Greece congratulations to the organizers the program of the conference is very interesting in our relative Department we have been addressing this disease and the recording of patients from all over Greece and we are doing a recording of incidents on the European Network [Music] therefore as a clinic we have a particular connection with the disease my my wife is a pediatrician neurologist and to see very often in uh mentions children with friedrich&amp;#39;s a taxi and the burden that brings it to the families therefore all together we have to embrace this effort that is taking place and to be able to the patients that we have to include them in clinical research and to give a boost to results and addressing this rare and difficult disease good luck to the conference thank you thank you professor here we have learned that we must be have the power of soul and I think that has has been shown the Olympic winner of our heart Mrs bulapatulido who is together with us with the Olympic winner but also the deputy head of the region of governor of uh Thessaloniki region good morning to everybody ladies and gentlemen I am in front of you who is uh oh and I&amp;#39;m saying I&amp;#39;m standing because some scientists managed to do so realizing the the hope I would like to express my oh to these people who are trying to find solutions for problems of people who while we consider that we will be we do not have any problems the pandemic showed us how vulnerable we are we have a constant challenges that we have to face and of course with the help of the scientists we can overcome the hurdles the funding of the infrastructure and the biological Department of the Aristotle University in Thessaloniki was not only in need but it was the need of the soul in order to support these people with the region of Macedonia which is uh of Western Macedonia is important because when you get the approval for the funding it is not the job of the region it is the job of um we have to bend down to the scientists because they are like athletes to win a prize our price is perhaps a medal but uh the medal for the side is easy to win your life and to win the life for certain people of people yes 35 000 Euros that we spend is nothing but if this helps from a wheelchair to have a child standing up and to help another child to tackle their problem I believe that we have a specific reason that we exist Ataxia can only bring to take away VA and bring back order taxes in order to win our life thank you very much and we will always be standing by you the pastor work is well known and we found out those of us that we didn&amp;#39;t know due to the pandemic we have been here for a very short time and we feel that we have been accepted by these people we would like to help them but Mrs that is gonna should allow us give us a short address to the conference please patients above all it&amp;#39;s a great pleasure to host you here the Hellenic Institute of pastel will constantly help towards these efforts not only by providing our premises but um as you very well know we have we do a lot of research for Human Health Services on diagonals not only the Corona virus but other diseases and of course research to The Wider field of Neurology therefore our actions are very many good projects and I hope that the next challenge we will have fruitful results and to have a note of optimism have good conference thank you very much I think that the scientific Community proved during the pandemic because if you don&amp;#39;t have any health problems we do not really understand how important is the health issue now with the pandemic we all realize that and how important is the scientific community and how we should let them to guide us because with the evolution of science we are going to have positive results and we will give hope for the people of friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia allow us now that I talked about rare diseases to give the floor to Mrs maryada [Music] 95 associations of our associations we are talking about the 95 percent of the people that do not have a treatment and you can see this in front of you when you don&amp;#39;t know where to address when you are lost Mr damoculu do you talk to us good morning I am the President of Association 95 with all over Greece representing a patients with rare diseases and for the first time in Greece we diagnose people we I have a child with a syndrome Williams it is a great pleasure to be with you in this Panic Hellenic conference in order to inform for this rare disease this disease which is very difficult to address and for children and adults and of course we have the imperative need for clinical research in order to find a treatment for the people who suffer at this point personally I would like to thank my personal friend Mr vasilis karachias for the invitation and for the cooperation with uh our association we are we belong to yes conferences like the one today are extremely important whether they are from the initiative of the patients or the cooperation of other people not only for the latest developments and exchange of best practices but because we all benefit all the stakeholders the most positive results of course we have the real needs of the patients we change attitude and we enhance cooperation the treatment is one of the most important issue the rare diseases six to eight thousand is a category of diseases which is which impose to the patient and the family a huge burden and the burden is in all sectors somatic psychological social Financial [Music] educational they so the journey has the the patient has a very difficult journey in order to manage in order to have access the holistic care social exclusion stigma we should not forget that 50 of the population are children therefore we are talking about a very young people and with low life expectancy with 95 percent of this disease is not having the treatment we understand that The Continuous Care of the patients and the daily fight to survive exhaust the patient himself and their family cooperation is of all the stakeholders Academy the pharmaceutical industry the society scientists health professionals you know so that we can invest into research we are here and I am really relieved at the turning point where we can cooperate and we have a golden opportunity to explore it fully what the pandemic taught to us and perhaps within the time not to lose person to invest today in what makes the unique hope for the rare diseases research development of therapists drugs in order to reach the patient I would like to wish you good luck in the conference and I expect with great interest in the speeches of the foreign scientists and the patients thank you very much thank you they are married and now at this point I would like to welcome our first panel welcome coaches and Mrs karadema Mr Alexis to take their seats in the panel give us one minute can you hear us I don&amp;#39;t know whether you can hear us I don&amp;#39;t know whether you can hear me yes perfectly I know that you had a very difficult day and I know that you tried very hard to be together with us today and thank you very much for that foreign I would like to welcome you to this first session the panel discussion starting allow me to congratulate it all an association for Ataxia Frederick and Mr karagias personally for the organization of this conference and Conference which is necessary and required today because there are radical developmental um progresses and the emerging treatments imposed that all the involved the parties they work together Physicians their patients estate and I think that this is a very clear and the perfect structure of today&amp;#39;s concurrency so let&amp;#39;s start asking the question what is the Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia first of all it is a rare disease a disease that affects one in a 50 000 people but the carriers of the disease are many more one to seven people or 90 people it is considered a classic degenerative disease with very specific characteristics either we talk about the century um situation and state or the movement of also there are certain classes of the classical phenotype and we also have myocardiopathy scoliosis diabetes and other manifestations as well foreign I mentioned that we&amp;#39;re talking about the neurodegenerative disease but from a clinical point of view many times it is a classified along with the um diseases foreign dystrophy Etc are aggressive in the beginning but in Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia this is something later during adolescence and the progress is not so fast the pulmonary function is a problem with the other dystrophysics but later on in a Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia so there are specific differences here but there is also a common characteristic and this is that you know in these in neuromuscular diseases the cooperation between many Specialties require that this is something that has been set out in the energy guidelines about the Frederick sataxia this is something that we have to talk about today whether all these guidelines are applied for the benefit of our patients another characteristic is the age of one sector most of the patients with Frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia are at the age of five or later on there are some patients that the onset of the disease is earlier than five years of age 80 to 90 percent of the patients we have the onset of the disease in the period from 5 to 20 years old so practically what does this mean it means that we need a treatment that are practically addresses um all the age Spectrum it means that the patients yesterday are going to live with this disease from the child the lessons to adulthood they are going to go to primary education secondary education University try to find work in these phases of their life they are going to create a specific treatment that what is this a specific treatment this is something that we are going to talk about the English and first person I would like you to ask a miss and dinoplus and here is neurology hospital to take the floor and talk to us about the beginning of this disease Mr dinoplus you have the flowers please unmute and also share the screen and actually oh yeah okay hello thank you very much Mr karadas for the invitation it is a conference as I heard from the people that practically deal with this neurodegenerative disease and I admire because every day we talk with families that have a children with a neurodegenerative diseases and I really hope that at the end of this conference we are going to have a fruitful conclusion of fruitful findings that are going to help these patients [Music] I&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about childhood the diseasing childhood and some clinical characteristics model because practically we are experiencing some very good days that we see this they deserve that in the past uh could not be treated or curable and could lead to death and nowadays we say that there are molecular techniques of genetic processing that practically contains the morbidity landscape and I really believe that very soon something will arise for prediction this is why my presentation is going to be a review of the primary times we see that the technology is a diseases the earlier that we can apply this genetic treatment the better for the patient so the early diagnosis at the point that the child does not show many symptoms we have an accumulation practically avoided signs the symptoms of Mobility skills it&amp;#39;s not I like the other neuromuscular diseases here we have some introductory notes we were talking about the known old disease in the German and hollow&amp;#39;s Frederick then described for the first time when the symptoms as we know they&amp;#39;re much more details of the general damage it&amp;#39;s practically due to effects and reputations in this means that you say uh synthesis of kratoxinia and that this engine can be expressed in the cerebellum is spinal cord harder muscle pancreas the spine and we have the various symptoms of the disease and in contrast to other diseases that practice is genetically are due to so a similar situations Dia uh three nucleotide expansions in England one of things are a bit different than here products which is the protein that is a regulator practically the nuclear symptoms foreign foreign [Music] classmates have managed years ago his mother helps him to wash his hair and touch his food and we&amp;#39;ll see that progressively this child although could do all these things in the pasta now she cannot control tries to adjust to the difficulties that are presented there and here you will have the attraction that we see established slowly they produce and at the same time century because we can see that very often here we have the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia the acronym is sorrow it is used the biology Nation itself and it is used to recognize the disease we use this tool this instrument for our patients with a taxi and of course patients with a Friedrich Ataxia there are other specifications and let&amp;#39;s see this situation here you can see a tribe the way that foreign does not fall down very quickly walks but there is something in his gate it&amp;#39;s not normal sometimes it goes towards the corner or a table cannot turn away [Music] sometimes to have at least a type of watching something that cannot be achieved when we have the ataxia very difficult for the child to do it and in this way we assess the gate the water another way to assess is The Stance the posture of the body um essence with a wide support base we have the grade 10. and we see whether a child can understand them in this way for 10 seconds as in this case you can see that it&amp;#39;s very difficult [Music] they actually become more difficult when we ask the child to join the two feet together in this case there is no child can stand upright foreign in the beginning is not affected but later on it is affected we say that the child here is not affected in the sitting position normal taking position no difficulties and the assessment of the speech is important each disturbance is very important the third speech we ask the child to talk and we can see that there is a North Korea in many cases then we go as you can see here where the child is asked to do specific movements and we measure this material in this case then there is this method that is lower than five centimeters in the nose finger tester in this tester we can assess this metric again but also tremor another Thursday here&amp;#39;s the test of fast alternating Health movement you say that there are slow movements in many cases and in this case we see that it is slightly irregular much here and another test quite difficult to be performed by children slide have this pathological abnormal manifestation in this way we examine children and we can easily see if there are some early forms of a taxi because as I said it is a very important to have an early diagnosis because sooner or later we are going to have some kind of treatments and we are going to hear to some Specialists later on about the possible treatment for the ataxia Usama good results and stabilization in these tests we really hope that the gene treatment or Janet Gene modification treatment will address the problem in a more functional way and after the early diagnosis by the pediatricians as I said before that the neuro degeneration was not progressed I would be able to treat them [Music] for this very informative presentation we gave us a brief and full picture of this disease it is a degenerative disease and it is a very important to have the opinion of a physician for the adult patients as well and this is why we&amp;#39;re going to have Mr kuchis with us foreign thank you very much for the invitation and I feel extremely I think too many patients here which are Greek speaking and it for some of them it might not be ideal so since you have this Comet and translation I would switch to Greek um sorry about this okay um good morning I&amp;#39;m very glad to see so many people here in the room with a families and patients I come from the United Hospital together with for many years managing the genetic Department of the hospital I&amp;#39;m going to mention two more things since 2017 at regulating hospital we are participating in this European registry and we see the patient&amp;#39;s prospectively we have this follow-up trying to be closer to the European activities and actions trying it to have our patients in studies and trials and have access to various other answers Hospital s recognized as the center of rare disease is neurological disease we are a member of the European reference Network and Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia is in with you the the diseases that have been certified with this air framework as a layer a hereditary axis and this is going to help our patients in the future this is the structure of my speech it&amp;#39;s quite brief the introductory elements have already been said I don&amp;#39;t want to Tire You by saying the same things again and again just two clinical points perhaps to be underlined for the neurologists I&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about the epidemiology in this as these data have been collected there for 25 years in the clinic if a picture of this the clinical progress of the Greek patients we&amp;#39;re going to see very briefly the algorithms that we use but of course the genetic and molecular approach is going to be touched upon by Mrs karadima later on was the first one to describe the disease the German and very soon he had restored that it was a hereditary um this is 1996 the gene was discovered let&amp;#39;s say here that this expansion that the lead said the loss of movement the two Ali Loma we have the symptoms as you can see here just a two passenger of all the attackers foreign but of course this is not something specific about the clinical picture I&amp;#39;m not going to spend much time here the first symptom may not be neurological one in 50 patients the first thing that the experiences is perhaps uh cardiac and this is a cardiologists in the majority the first symptom is the problems of walking also the characteristics is it the sensory cerebellar Ataxia from the beginning not just the cerebellar we have a mixed attacks here and this means something practical for the neurologists as well and the first years usually do not have cerebellar atrophy that cannot be seen in the MRI and this means that sometimes the diagnosis is not very specific cerebellar atrophy comes later on in this decision next is a percentage of a typical forms the Greek to 15 of the patients the disease has started later than 25 years of age and progresses slowly and this is related to the number of the repetitions of their legislative smaller than two others now I think a native hospital we said that 1996 regime was found in 1997 we tried to have the first black level diagnosis 1997. 2021 92 series of patients representing families of patients where we have residual manifestations ataxia half of them and we see the incidence of this action the great population all these years here at the laboratory assistance diagnosed 100 11 patients I want to stress that the neurogenetic unit has been the only laboratory the public health system that continuously ongoing without interruptions offers a molecular diagnosis and I believe that or we have patience in the first years patients used to go to Cyrus but in the last 10 years our clinical place at the most important role and here you can see the cases based on the residents of the patients can be found all over the territory of Greece at least according to the data that we have in a study performed some years ago we tried to see whether some religion said so higher prevalence there was the idea that this is the agenda answer the region of the Indian Island specifically the island was very prevalent in the island of Milos but had the disease was expressed in the children so we believe that there is a an increased incident in silence for the clinical picture of the patients slide this is a very busy slide based on 111 patients a diet removed the in the last 24 years the gender is as you can see why didn&amp;#39;t we average age let me see the patient is around the age of 25 but many of them had already been diagnosed by children&amp;#39;s neurologists around the age of 15 we have the onset of the disease 12 to 13 percent of the patients have a late manifestation on top of the disease you can see that they gave the symptom is for all the patients Babinski tiny here yes that disease progresses we have a paralysis of the Legacy at a certain degree this is a screenshot of the patients when we show them but we have to follow up the patients and the years to come data here 13 patients that we have followed up for at least three years in there we see that this scale presented to you by blister foreign [Music] but I think more or less the conclusion is are that our patients are the same with the European patients 26 patients will have included in Vegas a satisfactory number of patients and I really hope that in the future we are going to have more patience infection a few words about the suspicion when you become suspicious that this diagnosis should be made apart from the medical history of the family um sometimes we have parents that come from the same Village or Ataxia has been manifested there in a child another child of the family Mrs paradima is going to talk to you about this but in sporadicate Access as well we thought before the age of 25 foreign now we have only two children in a family by following this applying this algorithm study many some years ago from this position that have announced foreign disease fxn is a gene responsibility and the repetition of their genes the more frequent attacks with an early onset to the prevalence is one in 100 000 patients it is a possible clusters of the islands of the agenda the clinical picture of the patients in Greece does not differ from other European patients it will present as a research later and we must suspect that something is wrong what we see patients with some specific symptoms after excluding other causes I would like to conclude my speech here you see the key members of our Clinic thank you very much thank you Mr coaches for this comprehensive presentation that is based on their experience and I think it was very appropriate and the role that they have played in the diagnosis of ataxia unfortunately there is no time for questions perhaps at the end of the session some urgent questions may be answered now the next topic the next speaker it was mentioned by Mr Kutch is that cardiological problems sometimes constitute the beginning the initiation of the diagnosis but definitely had a big number of students for patients are the reasons of early mortality is the professor of pediatric cardiological at the hospital as a prime minister the Annapolis you have the floor good morning good to everybody it is a great pleasure and honor to be present in the first Spanish Hellenic conference for Fredericks I would really love to be with you but due to professional reasons according I have to be thessalonic I would like to give my work congratulations to Mr karachias the president together with his team to create this Hellenic Association of friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia we are talking about a very rare business which together with the creation of this association with the doctors become better and we feel that we are not alone we need everybody we need to be together and I think what was said at the beginning of the conference is that everybody is welcome we have to fight together and all the achievements and the good results derived from Collective efforts my one congratulations to Mr karachias and I would like to thank him that he gave me the honor and pleasure to be together with you in this conference I think can you see the okay can you see the screen and my slides therefore we are talking about a neurodegenerative disease data creates problems to the cardiovascular s this will have to talk about with the urologists and cardiologists as well and you will see which way and how important is the participation of a cardiologist in friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia epidemiologically lots of things have been mentioned definitely they are more common it&amp;#39;s more common in discussion and sub-Saharan Africa Asia and the United States one out of 50 000 or one out of hundred thousand as it would have said roughly we expect one of the two children to be born per year in Greece when we have a Greece with 100 years per year we expect one or two children to be born in Greece roughly we are these are in the numbers the very interesting things were received by Mr Goodrich who spoke to us about the island of Korea look existence of nature everybody admires the career because they for over a hundred years and in Italian you don&amp;#39;t die if you don&amp;#39;t exceed 100 years old but sometimes nature reverses itself it is well known the stories of a pathophysiology of the disease where we have a problem in the gene of horatuxin or products with GAA naturally in a natural person this triplet has a repetitions from 6 to 36 in a in Ataxia Breezy repetitions go over 66 some people say more than 66 roughly what else we see more than a hundred or up to 1700 then this is extremely significantly because the diagnosis and through the Gene and we can see all these things and have to do with the prognosis of the disease or as the foreign what I would say because I address the children I am a cardiologist that I will undertake a children&amp;#39;s ages what we start with with a clumsy child which is Clumsy and imagining that because in Pediatrics if something is out of the natural pediatricians are familiar and they always have a cardiovascular control there were cases where we had the diagnosis in ache Park Hospital in Thessaloniki from the cardiological part that is to say before Ataxia was named we had the clumsy child um we asked to have a cardiological uh um check and immediately we have the alarm we have the genetics who comes to get together the puzzle Parts hypertrophic and myocardiological and my cardio pasia cardiopathy and in a preventive pests we like we may have we are talking about hypertrophic cardiopathy together with a neurological institution that&amp;#39;s how we got to to the diagnosis that is to stay starting with the first neurological symptoms in combination that the pediatrician who is familiarized essential for cardio logical uh control we had we have the Frederick&amp;#39;s attacks and all the things that were said by the previous speakers that the age is that we usually see when we have the majority of diagonals at the age of 15. I believe that in the years to come this will be decreased because now we are more familiar and much more easily we can have the diagnosis and we have Gene controls compared to previous years that is to say we have become wise therefore this delay in diagnosis of previously yes I believe that from now on we will be much sooner better results in improving the situation of these children what we all know is that all of them will have a problem with myocardiopathy in the cases where the first diagnosis of ataxia without having cardiological deaths it is a self-evident that the cardiological person will follow which in its majority will prove the existence of a major cardiopathy whatever also whatever was nice to be said is that we may have myocardiopathy in the absence of neurological symptoms now how often does a figure cataxia occurs and there a five percent which you understand is a very very small percentage where we can have a Citrix Ataxia with cardiovascular and have a lack of neurological symptoms we said of course earlier on as regards the cardiovascular taken into consideration that it is a mitochondria disturbance we have a lack of protein and this leads to myopridiopathy in nurses fibrosis and we have a rarely we can have asymmetric hypertrophic and even more rare and more rarer therefore the myocardiopathy hypertrophic prevails but it is not a classic one or the inherited myocardiopathy has nothing to do with the hypertrophic myocardiopathy or Fitness Ataxia because here we have the intervention the delayed it um we have uh what that is to say we lose the um heart process that is to say we cannot have data blockers treatment which is the choice in the hypertrophic micro cardiopathy when we started with a child for example with a diagnosis of hypertrophically foreign throughout the time as regards to the address of the children with this cardiological problem the index of serious cardiological disease namely is what I said that we have the neurological symptoms the worse the problems is will be and also as regards the number of the triplet repetition and which does not have to do with a neurological symptoms and the duration of the disease perhaps we have people that are at the late age and with serious neurological symptoms but they have decreased rapid triplet repetitions and of course it is difficult to estimate the seriousness of the cardial participation because of the comorbidities the help that we have with the echo in very few minutes you have the diagnosis and now that we are acquainted with cardiac we are very familiar in order to see things more than we used to see in the past that is a micro granular and so on and so forth which which directors guide us better in early diagnosis and treatment the MRI helps quite a lot yes it is a expensive examination but mostly it will confirm to you with who you see these illnesses Frederick&amp;#39;s attacks here sometimes it is but of course we can use newer techniques the same rate in the ultrasound where we can collect the subclinical patients that and this is going to help in the future if you do his characteristics very simple test very simple test so these are clumsy children that we see they visit us and only from the ECG which is something very uh quicker and you can have the diagnosis and the sound later on so we have a characteristic sign so that you can see here conductivity disorders and this is the result of the fibrosis foreign but specifically these disorders the productivity disorders are the main characteristic now about the treatment there are many things happen instead as a conclusion I can say that in debenham and antioxidative agent something that we work is the other oxidative is something to be seen later on this is the only tool that we have and we are the oxidative group which has to do with the transfer of electrons and the restoration of energy there are some results about salsa that we have an improvement of the hypertrophy of The myocardium we will see later on how things will be affected you some studies that have been published with many patients we have some positive outcomes but as you can understand many things that need to be done in order to have our final conclusions I would like to of give some hope optimistic messages without having people the first efforts that have been carried out in myself showed a reverse of the biochemical and the cellular changes in myocalypopathy but it is only in myself I think that the future in medicine is going to be something extraordinary and I think that in a few years and they really believe that in the future this is something that we will be quite different from what we are seeing today everything will be related to Genesis to genetics we will be able to reveal in his genes and have a targeted the treatments the same disease in different people we will be able to intervene in a targeted way I believe that this is the future it&amp;#39;s going to be extraordinary and very impressive I would like again to give my congratulations to myself that today we have the first conference commission rare disease I really hope the best and wish the best for the president the members of this Association we need them we need their help thank you very much foreign taking place we are going to manage these symptoms and these signs so like he says Marius has the floor from the University of Florida thank you very much allow me to start with a small story some years ago I was visited by another lesson with his family who is one of the most frequent symptoms that the lessons faced scoliosis one of the most common problems and we have the he had the surgery there were some other problems of neurological nature that we detected so when Alki visited me again the diagnosis was um 3D attacks yeah foreign and became a member of this family a family that is called the attacks of Traders and I would like to warmly congratulate Mr karachias the president for everything that he has accomplished today waiting for the slides of the speaker there is always a plan B if this does not work awesome finishes in the next 10 minutes I&amp;#39;ll tell you a few things that have to do we&amp;#39;ll see orthopedic problems that may arise these problems is the final cord s food food this problem is that we use for these people that includes the support on a Blog foreign malformation otherwise we&amp;#39;re talking about the rigid malformation so children and other lessons with these problems well they suffer from attacks of friendly very usually they also suffer from praying due to the problems all the legs also usually they walk in a very peculiar way and this means that there is a problem that is created on the surface of the foot on the lower surface of the food at the same time not so frequent they&amp;#39;re going to be pain in other parts of the food foreign foreign and or he forces according to the International Medical literature the spine at the mild formation in these children with Ataxia for Frederick ranges from 63 to 100 63 percent dispensioned by yesterday or based on a DNA test in younger children yeah so this incident is reduced practically things that is a higher than 63 percent closer to 90 to 100 percent so this attacks here is scoliosis is manifested a few years after the Axia and affects above the genders it is very interesting that&amp;#39;s scoliosis in attack so Frederick there is a combined with because it&amp;#39;s something that is not very common when we have idiopathic scoliosis which is the most frequent one in a big number of cases one third of the patients that have malformation of the spine are not going to require a specific method of treatment is required when we had a progressive deterioration of the multiplication and this is usually for children when the scoliosis is the diagnosed before the age of 15. and in the children with Antarctica before the age of 10. affirmations that we see in the spine in children with an axial fabric are a radiologically similar to the ones that we see in idiopathic malformations of the spine and this is something that confuses us that&amp;#39;s happened with vacation life is that I mentioned in the beginning an exception is the malformations that we see in other neurological diseases that lead to the displacement of the body in one towards One Direction as I said 45 to 70 percent it&amp;#39;s called uses it is a very specific characteristic is that we have of course a left I thought I could probably say compared to the right ones that we see another idiopathic sclerosis attacks follows the specific rules concerning the clinical treatment the um drugs and medication to be used and the surgical procedure that can be used finally malformations the guardian is used when we have malformation from the 25 to 50 degrees but also in children or other lessons ever are not have another surgical procedure due to the problems that the children were accepted the guardian is not effective it is not going to affect the degenerative progress of the disease so we see a deterioration of the malformation inside the Caribbean now about the Imaging we have an assessment in evaluation of the spine because despite can affect the way that the head is a whole is held and the hip as well I would like you to know is that there are studies that show exactly sometimes we have in the MRI the anatomy which is a shown so uh the city scan is very useful for us for children that have a big degree of malformation and this can help us in order to design the surgical procedure it is very important to have a good cooperation with a cardiologists children&amp;#39;s cardiologists that are going to assess the child and give us sometimes we have problems with the lungs as well and of course we have to exclude the possibility of diabetes mellitus that could affect the respective procedure when we have over 50 degrees malformation the surgeon Master be aware of the problems that might exist opinion for example for children about a user wheelchairs Urology problems and something very specific is the apps and so reduction of the sensory potentials that we see during the surgical procedure what does this practical mean during the surgical procedure we have the corrections carried out and neurologists is present in the operating room giving us some Potentials in order to record the the function of the spinal cord unfortunately this cannot be done in these children with Ataxia of Frederick this is something that we can overcome in recent years the recording of the potentials and the possibility to place the inserts the graphs are very accurate robotics uh in these children we have to include every character and when we have um a child that is not ambulatory we have to expand our procedure up to the hip so that the correct position is given to the child the sitting on the wheelchair again it was a great honor to be here today with you thank you very much sir for his uh that said light to all the problems orthopedic problems that might exist for these patients and their positive life as I said we do not have time for questions so I would like to ask the last time assistant professor in biology and neurogetics I think you need to hospital to develop us the position of genetics and guiding these patients good morning to everybody thank you very much the association for the invitation to be a speaker in the reference conference I would like to ask them and we say we say this for this introduction I&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about the contribution of the neurogenetics and the study of the attraction of Frederick in Greek patients that these foreign both for the patients and their families as you know the cell is the subunit of the body and we can see it only through specific solution in the nucleus of HSA we have the genetic material the DNA they said DNA is stored in 23 chromosomes chromosome pairs and we have there the Genesis that have the con to find information about the proteins required by our body in this slide you can see the 23 chromosome pairs 22 Auto summary once each one comprises a two um a chromosomes exactly the same and here we have the effects Gene which is responsible for the attack of the free dry here we see the fat tracks in between five I told the regional service boxes were codified we have the information in order to create the flatraction protein between the boxes one and two the actions we have the repetition GAA you can send a picture and when we have foreign more than 66 we have the abnormal one this is related to 96 percent of the Ataxia of Red Rifle cases in very rare cases we have this we have following the mutations these red boxes one nucleotide to change in one of them in this case this is people having one a chromosome in the abnormal repetition of Gia in the other chromosome they have a point foreign continue stops functioning protein is the production of this protein is blocked protein is very important to have a function of mitochondrians we&amp;#39;re talking about a very small formations inside the cell generating energy when we do not have energy generated the cell cannot function so there is a necrosis say the flatrax engine is expressed in the cardiac tissue neurological relation pancreas so the most common clinical signs focus on these specific issues now 1997 and onwards we are the students and discovered the fratraction Gene and so then mutations related to the disease and with the progress of the molecular medicine and the genetics we can now detect the disease in the DNA of each person so we can provide genetic control both congregations and the normal carriers of the disease medicine foreign 96 of the cases one and in some cases we have point mutations so the laboratory protocols multiplication [Music] of the region that inclusively say uh three nucleotide repetition or if the pixiara that has another access that we use them in order to detect it these three nucleotide repetition whether the fungus sequencing reading one by one of the basis of the qualifying regions is used in order to determine the very rare point mutations and in this way to find the company combine the heterozygotics so this units are applied at the oh you need your hospital since 1997 today 619 genetic controllers have been performed 111 cases were positive for attacks of Frederick and 102 were normal carriers were talking about autosomalous disease which means it&amp;#39;s not for a person to get the disease both genes in a pair nine chromosomes must be mutated these children as a rule come from parents as you can see here man and woman are a normal Pirates as you can see in their chromosomes normally so they are a careers of invitation 25 possibility the first child Friedrich 50 percent to have children that are going to be careers to have limitations and 25 that have two normal chromosomes it is to see to examine the careers when we have a family of which a member has attacked so Frederick the parents of the cyclics must be controlled it is very important when we have a scheduled a pregnancy control and plaster must be carried out and this is the only way to prevent the transference of the mutated Gene in the next Generations and it is a way to abolish the disease increase the incidence of over their disease as you heard from the previous species is well there is some kind of affinity between the parents and the common origin so in our unit most of you know it because you have visited us you will have a special Clinic genetics a clinic um and the neuro kinetic scale laboratory these are combined and cooperated so in the end we can have a timely and valid diagnosis we provide consultancy genetics consultancy and follow up for our patients in the last four years we have radical a developments in the first neurology clinic of the United Hospital foreign population in 2020 the first neurology clinic was included in the European networks for rare neurology diseases and of course the attacks of food life is included in one of them and of course in effects in the last four years also is a research program that started by Stephanie two years ago aiming at providing genetic diagnosis and clinical diagnosis free of charge for the Greek population and genetic control of rare neurological diseases I mean this program is not included and because there is but because there is a panhellenic network we believe that in the future it will be included finally apart from all this a few words about the tests that are qualitative certified by a European network is then and in the last years to cooperation or between us and the Laboratories of neurogenetics in Cyprus we have a collaboration and confirmation of the words also in the future we are going to have a great development in our laboratory because we&amp;#39;re expecting specific instruments DNA analysis or tested many Genies are going to be tested using New Generation sequencing automated instrument for DNA isolations and this field is blood relations are going to be more coordinated and has to never done what is happening now and accuracy the space that we have in the Laboratories expanded by 25 square meter results for the new instruments foreign I am optimistic about new treatments but in order to eliminate the disease if the screening the genetic screening is included in the prenatal test of a person that wants a child in the family this is a procedure which is not a very expensive and we have a radical outcomes thank you very much for the excellent presentation and the informations she gave us which places besides the role as I said we do not have question time for questions I would like to thank all the speakers and I think it was confirmed is great thank you very much for a very important contribution in today&amp;#39;s event I think the fact that we came until one o&amp;#39;clock shows the interest and then I think we will not have time for uh for our break because we have people from Australia and the United States therefore we should be on time therefore I know that you are tired but let&amp;#39;s give a stretch for five minutes and then we change the panel into a carry on thank you very much",

    "transcript": "hey guys welcome back to today&amp;#39;s video and if you&amp;#39;re new here then click the playlist above and you&amp;#39;ll get a series of videos where you can know more about me and today&amp;#39;s video is quite highly requested because i like get questions on a daily basis about like what happened and what are the symptoms like can you do this can you do that so yeah okay so today i&amp;#39;ll be talking about my disease that i have and the symptoms that i experience like for each person is extremely different so the disease that i have is called fa which is uh foreign damage to the neural system so it&amp;#39;s a neurodegenerative disease that is progressive so like initially i was walking and all and now i&amp;#39;m in a wheelchair uh but because it affects the neurosystem like walking is not the only issue that i have there are many more things that people uh experience and yeah today i&amp;#39;m gonna talk about all of those things so the first symptom that i have is a high heart feet so like people the structure of my bones in my feet they have like an arch kind of thing uh which makes it difficult to stand and like the structure of my left foot is like weird i don&amp;#39;t know i&amp;#39;ll put a video i don&amp;#39;t know how to explain it but that makes it extremely difficult to stand even and walk and that&amp;#39;s why i wear uh leg braces if you&amp;#39;ve ever seen in my photos or like if you&amp;#39;ve seen me in public then yeah that&amp;#39;s the reason i wear like braces for like support for my legs okay so the main main symptom of frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia uh is lack of coordination and lack of balance so like i actually laugh about this now like basically i don&amp;#39;t have balance as a normal person would so like imagine a drunken person for example not like the mental effects but like the physical effects of getting drunk like being all lack of balance and moving here and there like there are incidents in my life which i&amp;#39;m like how did that happen how did that happen so i just started laughing out about it and let me show you a few clips yeah and uh if you know me then uh you know that i love coffee so like i have like super different experiences with the coffee itself because like i cannot properly like hold the mug itself because of lack of balance in my arms so like but still i go through the pain i go through everything and i drink my coffee even if i need to use straw i&amp;#39;ll do it but i need my coffee so did you know that my eyes can dance so like uh i actually don&amp;#39;t know that it&amp;#39;s happening but when i talk to people they&amp;#39;ve told me like my friends and even my parents my dad has told me a new time that my eyeballs inside just keep dancing inside and i don&amp;#39;t even know that it&amp;#39;s happening wait let me see if like i can show you i&amp;#39;ll try to show you wait so i&amp;#39;ll just be staring yeah my eyeballs can dance can yours no i don&amp;#39;t think they can so the next thing it&amp;#39;s a major thing it&amp;#39;s uh fatigue so uh if you want to know the value of it then basically it&amp;#39;s like mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell of europe but they certainly would know and yeah we lack mitochondria in our body and that&amp;#39;s why like we experience this fatigue you know so like i get like super tired for like doing the smallest smallest of things like my mom will be in the kitchen like the whole morning or something and she won&amp;#39;t be as tired and i&amp;#39;ll just be like going to the washroom or taking a bath and i&amp;#39;ll be like dead on the bed like doing like certain things just hike up my fatigue like while going to the washroom and like taking a bath and that&amp;#39;s why like um if i get sick then i can&amp;#39;t even do these things because like oh when a person gets sick they get tired also and like i&amp;#39;m already tired like without getting sick i&amp;#39;m already tired so if i get sick then i just end up on the bed and i don&amp;#39;t do anything like okay so the next thing that i have is uh scoliosis so scoliosis is like having an arc in your back like uh your spine is straight but mine is like curvy that makes sense like i&amp;#39;ll put a picture or something yeah so my spine is curvy and that uh affects like the structure of my body and also i&amp;#39;m not sure but that might be the cause of my back pain that i have i&amp;#39;ve become like a grandma early in my age oh yeah and uh i don&amp;#39;t know if you guys know but then my speech is also slurred people with predixor taxia have like a varying speed problem mind is not that bad some people can&amp;#39;t even talk properly uh but uh my dad keeps telling me that my i have a nasal voice so i talk with my nose i don&amp;#39;t know if that makes sense but then uh yeah i don&amp;#39;t know like you guys tell me is my speech slurred i think it is learn a bit and that&amp;#39;s why i was so conscious to speak but now obviously i&amp;#39;m used to it so like it&amp;#39;s just a normal thing that i&amp;#39;m doing right now and yeah like when i was like around like 11 12 or 13 or something like that 13 or something i was a kid okay i was a kid and that time i had cardiomyopathy so that&amp;#39;s like um an enlarged heart kind of thing it&amp;#39;s a heart condition and because of that like i had breathing problems and like my heart was racing 24 7 and i used to be like pretty active when i was a child also like i used to swim and like play soccer and all those things so like this cardio mother used to cardio cardiomyopathy used to interfere with like all my activities so that it was there but then like when i came to india it like vanished all of a sudden and ever since i&amp;#39;ve never checked up on my heart or anything like i never felt the need to i don&amp;#39;t know i mean maybe i should and frederick&amp;#39;s attacks also causes diabetes in people so like uh i&amp;#39;m thankful to the lord to the god that i don&amp;#39;t have diabetes as of now i don&amp;#39;t have it because i love my sweets i i&amp;#39;m like a desert person like if i go to a restaurant i&amp;#39;ll focus more on the desserts than the main course so yeah those are my symptoms with the fa and i don&amp;#39;t know why i don&amp;#39;t think i missed anything like if i was in a clinical trial then i would like be backed up with all the symptoms that i&amp;#39;m facing and all but right now like i&amp;#39;ve just forgotten that i have this fa and i&amp;#39;m just not like you know going and looking at all my symptoms so these are all the things that i have and these are all things i wrote down and i don&amp;#39;t think i missed anything but uh yeah if you also have fa then please let me know what are the things that you will have what are the symptoms that you are facing and yeah please subscribe press the like button and i&amp;#39;ll be

    "transcript": "hi everybody so I&amp;#39;m uh Dr Sanjay b chandani um M anfa researcher here at OU um and I just wanted to thank everybody for being here and for your support and generosity honestly this makes a researcher feel really good that the community is behind us and we&amp;#39;re all on the same page and we&amp;#39;re all trying to get to the same thing which is the cure for this devastating disease called fa um I&amp;#39;m here to introduce another fa researcher who&amp;#39;s a superstar he&amp;#39;s the professor of Neurology um at UT Southwestern and he&amp;#39;ll just be coming up uh in a second his name is Dr mik napala and he does a lot of things for fa and I&amp;#39;ve known him for at least 20 years and he&amp;#39;s like I said a superstar researcher um but I just wanted to give you one sort of angle on the kinds of things that are necessary for research in FA to happen so obviously people with fa are seen in the clinic and we collect blood samples and but in research Labs you need to work on people&amp;#39;s cells and people&amp;#39;s DNA on people&amp;#39;s genes to be able to come up with a a cure for fa and Dr napala in addition to the research that he does he is one of the world&amp;#39;s biggest repositories for celles from people with fa so somebody in Europe wants to work on people with fa he will ship them via FedEx sells from people who have fa and when I say Sals now we obviously know that people with fa have a neurological condition and they have a heart condition he will even sell send them not sell them send them cells that are neurons brain cells and heart cells from people with fa so he&amp;#39;s got the technology to actually make these cells from the cells that you get in the clinic and he&amp;#39;ll make these nerve cells and heart cells and send them around the world and this just gives you another angle on what it takes to actually come up with a it&amp;#39;s not just clinical trials there are a lot of things that have to be tried in the lab and then they get into people and so I&amp;#39;m going to introduce Dr mik [Applause] napala well thank you so much and it it is my first time our first time at at Suare and as a good scientist I I do have a very short power Point presentation so if you if you look at the slides um so yes we have a lab currently at in Dallas at University of Texas uh Southwestern Medical Center but the accent is not from Texas I was born raised and educated in Poland okay so just to clarify that and we have a we have a laboratory which is focused exclusively on FAA we only work with fa we have been doing it for way more than 15 years uh and I I think on the next slide we have kind of an overview of different projects a picture of the lab and this is a different project which we which we are engaged in we look for not only a cure but we look for molecular bases of the disease which then can lead to finding a different modes of therapies we also work with specific fre samples patients not all fre are the same we look with uh we work with samples with patients which we called point mutation those are rare patients but they exist uh we worked on uh developing specific essays which can help uh developing a cure so on the next slide um I wanted to to point out what what Dr B chandani Sanji pointed out that uh this is a human disease yes when we discovering a drug or a cure we cannot really work initially in humans yes we have to work in something which we called Model systems what are model systems and you can see those on those slides this is bacteria eoli it&amp;#39;s a very common model system we work in the lab actually some of the basic mechanism of 3D taxi was were discovered in ecola in bacteria yeast common yeast are very good scientific model we heard for sure about drosophila fruit fly a good model Mouse model everybody everybody uh heard about it but what my lab specializes it in is human cells human cellular models so those are cells which are actually taken from fa patients their family members and unaffected controls and on the next slide um it&amp;#39;s just an introduction we established that a few years ago it&amp;#39;s called the freed taxia celline repository and on the next slide I uh it&amp;#39;s it outlines how the process how the process works so we collaborate mostly with Dr David Lynch which probably most of you know in Children Hospital of Philadelphia when he sees a patient with fa the patient donates a piece of of a skin this piece of a skin from the arm is sent via FedEx overnight to our laboratory and we develop from the this piece of skin we develop cells called Skin fiber blasts and you can say well what skin has to do and this actually the picture shows those develop the process of development takes about two months to get those cells what skin has to do with fa well it can so in the next slide um it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a representation this shows what we actually have in the repository currently in the repository we have cells from the skin of about 80 FR Dr patients we also have a different type of cells from these patients and I&amp;#39;m going to to tell you about it on the on the next slide um actually on the next slide we have also okay so let me let me divert for a second so what we can do with those skin cells um the skin cells can uh serve to generate cells called induced PL poent stem cells what are those induced PL poent stem cells these are the cells which we can use to generate cells which are affected in free drugs so we take skin we make those induced PL potent stem cells which can be then differentiated into different types of cells so from those induced ploton St cells we can make neuronal cells so the cells which are in our brain affected in fredrix we can make from those cells cells called cardiomyocytes cardiac cells which are affected in free RS so this is all comes from one 3 mm piece of a skin biopsy from an arm of impatient and as I mentioned we have about 30 of those uh about 80 of those lines in our repository and next slide shows you what we also do we work with them in the lab but we ship them we ship them all over the world those cells are actually right now in India in Australia they are in France in in Sweden in many other European countries and on this map you also see how many different cities in the United States have those cells uh I think we we made more than 100 shipment since the the the we moved to UT Southwestern next slides actually show you how this entire process works this process takes about four months total starting from this little piece of skin which you see on the left corner then the next part of that slide is those skin fibr blasts grown those skin cells then the next part part is those round cells which are induced PL poent stem cells and then on the right hand side you can see neuronal cells on the left hand side if we could make a video this actually is a video you would see those are cardiac cells which are beating so this is part of our laboratory I would say about 20 or 30% of our e effort goes to that repository the rest goes to the basic projects in fre R and of course this is doesn&amp;#39;t happen by me I&amp;#39;m sitting in the office and organizing those things what it happens thanks to is on the next slide is the people in the lab uh Jill uh Puri and all other who are shown here and all their projects and the second thing which is most important in our work is the funding this doesn&amp;#39;t happen for free we have funding from federal government from uh Department of Defense from National Institute of Health but we have been blessed with the continuous funding uh from Far um and thank you guys for that that&amp;#39;s what you contribute [Applause]",

    "transcript": "good evening everyone I&amp;#39;m Mike Bryant this is my first time at the Suare and this has been this is just been great um I&amp;#39;ve been asked to uh introduce our next speaker whom I&amp;#39;ve known for quite some time um many of you may have heard fa&amp;#39;s um with this quote fa does not define me you&amp;#39;ve probably heard that a lot from faers well that&amp;#39;s true of Kyle fa does not define him all of his accomplishments Define him he&amp;#39;s a University graduate he graduated in with an engineering degree after five years he couldn&amp;#39;t do it in four um and after a couple of years of working in engineering he decided that it wasn&amp;#39;t for him and he wanted to ride his bike for a living so that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s done for the last 15 years or so he is the uh founder and the director of the Rita taxia program through Farah and over the last 10 or 12 years they&amp;#39;ve raised over $10 million through that program and I think just as importantly the program has brought together thousands of people who otherwise would never have known about Frederick&amp;#39;s sat taxia and it&amp;#39;s brought together the whole fa community in a lot of different ways and I think that&amp;#39;s one of his greatest accomplishments he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s a excuse me he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s my hero and uh I know that he&amp;#39;s an inspiration to many of the fa and he&amp;#39;s also a great symbol of Hope for a lot of the families in the caregivers out there his his motto which his mother hates is it&amp;#39;s not supposed to be easy and that kind of defines a lot of his uh physical challenges that he&amp;#39;s decided to overtake during the years as an example the notes I have for this speech are on the back of my vaccination card so that I can go to India to cycle with Kyle to the highest paved Road in the world 19,000 ft so Frederick&amp;#39;s a taxia does not define Kyle but I think it explains a lot of things um I think it&amp;#39;s brought out the best in him and I&amp;#39;m very proud to be able to introduce him as my son Kyle Bryant [Applause] all right does anyone else need to wipe the tears from their eyes over that one thank you Dad that was that was wonderful um you know I&amp;#39;m so proud that introduction was makes me really proud uh because we all know that many of the things about who we are are from our parents and I&amp;#39;m so proud of that so thank you Dad um and I&amp;#39;ve got to tell you that I&amp;#39;m fired up lately like be Beyond fired up that I&amp;#39;ve ever been before and it&amp;#39;s because of all of you it&amp;#39;s because of the momentum of the fa Community not only in research and Drug development yeah that momentum is going like crazy right now but also just people understanding that supporting each other is what makes this community and what moves us all forward this event is a prime example of that it&amp;#39;s all of us coming together incredible details that the Gars have thought of and bringing everyone together to support each other and to support treatments and a cure for fa so thank you so much to the gar family the delightful G family for putting all of this together I also do have to compliment Michael speech how incredibly powerful was that thank you so much Michael contributions to the fa Community come in all shapes and sizes and as my dad said on June 2 first we&amp;#39;re leaving the us to go to India we&amp;#39;re going to ride 200 miles from 11,000 ft up to 19,000 ft and some people would say like I&amp;#39;ve gotten this question a lot I feel like why why would you do that why do you need to go to the top of the highest p in the world and a lot of it is personal I want to be at the top of the highest paved Road knowing that I got there under my own power I want that from me but also this is how I contribute to the fa Community I love cycling I I love cycling probably more than anything in my life and to be able to say and to myself that I can use that to benefit the fa Community to get us all closer to the cure for fa I&amp;#39;m really really excited about that but you know the thing that gets me really fired up is seeing people in the community realize their value and realize that they can make an impact it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be cycling you don&amp;#39;t have to ride a trike or or a bike to contribute to the momentum of the community it&amp;#39;s playing music right how much money debris raised tonight let&amp;#39;s here for all the incredible progress you made so it&amp;#39;s playing music it&amp;#39;s participating in clinical trials making our voices heard on Capitol Hill and wherever it needs to be heard and it&amp;#39;s reaching out to each other and supporting each other through the through [Music] this incredibly difficult Journey but it&amp;#39;s so rewarding when we can support each other and realize our power to affect everybody in the community and move us all forward so thank you for getting me fired up and thank you to the G family for getting everyone together and getting us all closer to trement and care for fa thank you so [Applause] much so I&amp;#39;m not in your program because this is a surprise oh no it&amp;#39;s not you&amp;#39;ve been here before so um when you have a child with fa step back when we think of our lives for those of us who don&amp;#39;t have fa I think we would like to think of them as a nice smooth airplane ride you&amp;#39;re going down the runway and you take off when you&amp;#39;re born and you start to ride and you get higher and higher and it&amp;#39;s a controlled and it&amp;#39;s better and better and then you get to a cruising altitude and everything&amp;#39;s going and you have you you get a job and you have a family or whatever you choose to do with your life you do it and then if we if our dreams are met we retire we get spend time more time with family and slowly you know we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re coming in for a landing and if everything goes the way we would dream it would go we would come into that smooth landing and would we would pass away and our family would would remember all the times that we had and that would be the way that we would envision our lives going for a parent to watch a child with fre it&amp;#39;s a tax here it&amp;#39;s more like watching somebody shot out of a cannon and your child is at first rising and rising and you think this is great this is you loved the child more than you loved anything in your life and you&amp;#39;re and and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s and this is wonderful but then something&amp;#39;s off and you begin to detect this Arc that you did not expect and you go to doctors and you find this and you learn this and so forth and finally you realize your your child is now starting to fall and you don&amp;#39;t know what to do and you&amp;#39;re trying to figure this out and the child is struggling and you&amp;#39;re struggling and what you want is something somebody to throw your child a Lifeline get this child some help and so now through Farah we have an organization that has put together the basic research to find these technologies that have the potential to bring our kids to help our kids with this as they begin to fall in the off Arc we&amp;#39;re looking at between Farah and Fa research Labs which are here tonight and pharmaceutical companies which are here tonight they&amp;#39;re looking at Wing suits and parachutes and all different ways of helping our kids catch a lift and join us on the airplane and we will get there this is the part of the evening okay there&amp;#39;s still wine over there I was going to say the silent auction is closed there&amp;#39;s still wine so please buy some more wine I&amp;#39;m not sure if there&amp;#39;s any jewelry left this is the part of the evening where we simply ask for a donation we&amp;#39;re not asking we&amp;#39;re not going to give you a silent auction item or or a jewelry pool or anything else like that we would ask that we&amp;#39;ve got a few more songs and the before we announce our results if you have anything left in your wallets please pull them out Michael mentioned that at the beginning of the night we were at $390,000 our goal in 2024 was $424,000 we are within sight of that goal so if you have anything left to give please give and enjoy these next three songs before we before we announce our results and thank you all for coming tonight we appreciate you all very very much and we love you thank you [Applause]",

details on this issue i have a brief introductory talk because we have the members of the hellenic association for friedrichs ataxia the carers the patients in greece and abroad the members of the medical community researchers representatives of pharmaceutical companies friends and all of you we would like to welcome you in this effort that we are doing at the institute of pastor which we would like to thank for costing us today is a day of hope why because our patients from all over greece whether they are together with us in this hall or through the internet after many years that they were expecting for the highlighting of their disease this becomes a reality the success of today&amp;#39;s event proves that with collective work effort targets we can achieve a lot through the brief period of time from our foundation our association managed to highlight increase three drinks ataxia but also in south and eastern europe in the framework of an ambitious but at the same time realistic action plan we have put certain targets and actions which we implement step by step our association has developed successfully the internal and international cooperations and it is a full member of your ataxia member of the association of patients in greece of rare diseases our association also considers extremely significant the cooperation that it has developed in recent years with u.s research ataxia alliance which we would like to thank for their support in today&amp;#39;s event allow me to address our patients all over greece who most of them are at an advanced stage of their illness and as a result they cannot be with us here today i would like to address the the guys in various alumni in the island of pakistan the island of corfu commuting island of coast rakland i would like to address all our patients their carers and parents who have enrolled in today&amp;#39;s conference and are following the conference in more than 22 countries in the world argentina brazil austria belgium canada cyprus germany recording in progress is because six to eight percent of people in europe cover heir disease this reflects to 30 million citizens in the european union in all these people we have to give some hope and our efforts converge towards this point of course we are not disillusioned we know that we have a very difficult road ahead of us we hope that we are very close to the first treatment and of the disease our job as representatives of the patients starts now since we still have to begin so that these therapies will be available available and accessible to our patients both greece and abroad we are sure that the state will stand by us to the rare patient and show their interest and give equal opportunities to all the people i would like to thank all of you and without any further ado let&amp;#39;s begin our conference [Music] let&amp;#39;s give the floor to mr jera petritus minister of state to address the conference i would like to thank you for the invitation to this first panic hellenic conference for friedrichs ataxia and to wish good luck in this conference for the clinical and approval of the first drugs that are going to help towards this direction i have center could sense a big message of hope to all uh the citizens that they suffer from any kind of disease i would like to talk to you about the mrs mr karadia&amp;#39;s contribution who is serving this purpose and my hope is that things will change to the best for the state mechanism who at some degree has made some steps forward in order to enhance the public policy for disability and i think it is a very good example of the horizontal policy of the state and it was the first public policy that the new government undertook in 2019 following the recommendations of the united nations for the rights of disabled people and after systemic work we had the national action plan for disabled people and it was put into public dialogue in 2020 and it constitutes a very detailed approach with six pillars 30 targets actions that have specific body of implementation specific budget and specific timetable of implementation we enhance all the practices and on the other hand for the first time we have close together all the actions that have to do with disability with a central control system for the development of the action national action plan we have actions the activation of course of the coordinating mechanism in all regions and municipalities and ministries there is a reference point for monitoring this action plan so that we can have the real owner of each body who is responsible and we set up the national committee of accessibility the counseling body for the state from people from greece and abroad of high pressures that work with intensive rate in order to develop these policies we had a wide codification of all the circulars that have to do with disability let me point out that we are talking about a field where the multi-laws was not a good example a huge effort that was concentrated in over 7 000 pages so that each and every citizen will understand in a unified text the rights they have we already have the electronic platform of accessibility for all the buildings of public interest shows that on the first level we can record and second level to improve the accessibility of public buildings although already we have 3 30 500 buildings on this platform and we have recorded a relevant amount of money from the recovery fund so that we can work this institution we have the institutionalization of the first pilot program for the personal carer with 1 000 positions and beneficiaries with a certified disability of at least 67 percent for the region of vatican and then for the rest of greece we have the inclusive the inclusive approach in education and on another level we have employed 4 000 teachers for students especially for special needs and problems so that we can have an essential educational policy for people with disabilities we concluded the national strategy of implementation and we will have the institutionalization policy and we have the unified page of jr which is the the first accessible platform of the public administration certified with the highest degree 3a for with the rights of the people of disabilities and each and every person can have direct and without restrictions access and in the next period we have the unified card of disability the transfer of kpa into modern places in the peace and friendship stadium and of course we have updating of the national action plan with new significant actions every society is judged with the respect that they show to the vulnerable citizens i think it&amp;#39;s time we have inclusive policies in order to have a society open and accessible to everybody thank you very much i hope you have a very fruitful conference with fruitful results thank you the state minister and allow me to read the message of mr plebis the minister for health honorable president dear ladies and gentlemen i would like to thank you for your invitation and i hope that you achieved the targets of the conference i feel a great pleasure that today i addressed this panic hellenic conference ataxia means lack of taxes as an illness as a disease causes the lack of taxes and autonomous movement the conference is a landmark for our country because it&amp;#39;s the first time in greece the the issues that we are going to discuss are very impressive the researches and the clinical research give us the hope for this disease the people who suffer have the opportunity to speak in public for the problems they face and let us know the needs that they have it is important to listen to all the problems they have so that we can relieve them both from the side of the state and science they are symbols of persistence and courage and we have to stand by them it is important to have such scientific initiatives information awareness exchange of opinion education clinical research and direct communication with the people lead to the best services and better i would like to welcome all the speakers from greece and abroad and the organizers that they have worked hard for the success of this conference i would like to address this conference and i wish you every success athanasius players minister for health and let&amp;#39;s hope that the ministry of health will embrace this initiative and will really stand by these patients now i will give the floor to the president of the neurologic society mister c wools professor with huge scientific background to talk to us about to address the conference dear colleagues dear patients good morning i am your host steve golis professor of neurology of the national podunity of athens and president of the hellenic neurological society i addressed the initiative of the hellenic society for friedrichs ataxia for the organization of the first panhellenic conference as a scientist and neurologist i consider extremely important the public discussion that will promote the significance and of this rare disease and the urgent need in order to find treatment representation of modern scientific developments of the pioneering clinical trials that are taking place globally will offer new hopes to the patients that they have at least they suffer from this disease in order to have the best possible tackling of it now let&amp;#39;s give the floor to professional neurologist mr stefanis good morning you have the floor professor good morning i would like to thank for the invitation i would like to address this fantastic conference it is the first meeting for friedrichs ataxia in greece congratulations to the organizers the the program of the conference is very interesting in our neurologic department we have been addressing this disease and recording of patients from all over greece and we are doing a recording of incidents on the european network from mario&amp;#39;s partners and now mr coach is in miscarriage therefore as a clinic we have a particular connection with the disease my my wife is a pediatrician neurologist and she very often mentions children with friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxi and the burden that brings to the families therefore all together we have to embrace this effort that is taking place and to be able to the patients that we have to include them in clinical research and to give a boost to research and addressing this rare and difficult disease good luck to the conference thank you thank you professor here we have learnt that we must we have the power of soul and i think that has has been shown the olympic winner of our heart mrs vula patulido who is together with us with the olympic winner but also the deputy head of the region of governor of thessaloniki region good morning to everybody ladies and gentlemen i am in front of you with uh oh and i&amp;#39;m saying i&amp;#39;m standing because some scientists managed to do so realizing the the oh i would like to express my ow to these people who are trying to find solutions for problems of people who while we consider that we we do not have any problems the pandemic showed us how vulnerable we are we have constant challenges that we have to face and of course with the help of the scientists we can overcome the hurdles the funding of the infrastructure and the biological department of the aristotle university in thessaloniki was not only in need but it was the need of the soul in order to support these people with the region of macedonia which is of western macedonia is important because when you get the approval for the funding it is not the job of the region it is the job of us and we have to bend down to the scientists because they are like athletes to win a prize our price is perhaps a medal but the medal for the scientists is to win your life and to win the life for a certain people of people yes 35 000 euros that we spend is nothing but if this helps from a wheelchair to have a child standing up and to help another child to tackle their problem i believe that we have a specific reason that we exist ataxia can only bring to take away va and bring back order taxes in order to win our life thank you very much and we will always be standing by you the pastor work is well known and we found out those of us that we didn&amp;#39;t know due to the pandemic we have been here for a very short time and do we feel that we have been accepted by these people we would like to help them but uh start is going to should allow us give us a short address to the conference please thank you mr spiropolo chair dear participants patients above all it&amp;#39;s a great pleasure to host you here the hellenic institute of pasteur will constantly help towards these efforts not only by providing our premises but as you very well know we have we do a lot of research for human health services on diagnosis not only the coronavirus but other diseases and of course research to the wider field of neurology therefore our actions are very many good projects and i hope that the next challenge we will have fruitful results and to have an auto of optimism have a good conference thank you very much i think that the scientific community proved during the pandemic because if you don&amp;#39;t have any health problems we do not really understand how important is the health issue now with the pandemic we all realize that and how important is the scientific community and how we should let them to guide us because with the evolution of science we are going to have positive results and we will give hope for the people of friedrichs ataxia allow us now that i talked about rare diseases to give the floor to mrs mariadamopolo [Music] associations of associations we are talking about the 95 of the people that do not have a treatment and you can see this in front of you when you don&amp;#39;t know where to address when you are lost mr adam apollo you talk to us good morning i am the president of association 95 with all over greece representing patients with rare diseases and for the first time in greece we diagnose people we i have a child with a syndrome williams uh it is a great pleasure to be with you in the spanish hellenic conference in order to inform for this rare disease this disease which is very difficult to address and for children and adults and of course we have the imperative need for clinical research in order to find a treatment for the people who suffer at this point personally i would like to thank my personal friend mr vasiles karaz gas for the invitation and for the cooperation with our association we are we belong to yes conferences like they want today are extremely important whether they are from the initiative of the patients or the cooperation of other people not only for the latest developments and exchange of best practices but because we all benefit all the stakeholders the most positive results of course we have the real needs of the patients we change attitude and we enhance cooperation the treatment is one of the most important issues the rare diseases six to eight thousand is a category of diseases which is uh which imposed to the patient and the family a huge burden and the burden is in all sectors somatic psychological social financial [Music] educational they so the journey has the the patient has a very difficult journey in order to manage in order to have access the holistic care social exclusion stigma we should not forget that 50 of the population are children therefore we are talking about a very young people and with low life expectancy with 95 of these diseases not having the treatment we understand that the continuous care of the patients and the daily fight to survive exhausts the patient himself and their family cooperation is of all the stakeholders against the academia the pharmaceutical industry the society scientists health professionals so that we can invest into research we are here and i am really relieved at the turning point where we can cooperate and we have a golden opportunity to exploit fully what the pandemic taught to us and perhaps within the time not to lose patience to invest today in what makes the unique hope for the rare diseases research development of therapies drugs in order to reach the patient i would like to wish you good luck in the conference and i expect with great interest the speeches of the foreign scientists and the patients thank you very much thank you they are married and now at this point i would like to welcome our first panel welcome mr jimmy and from mr coochies and mrs to take their seats in the panel give us one minute can you hear us i don&amp;#39;t know whether you can hear us i don&amp;#39;t know whether you can hear me yes perfectly i know that you had a very difficult day and i know that you tried very hard to be together with us today is a professor in neurology director of the first neurology clinic we would like to thank you very much dear president their colleagues ladies and gentlemen i would like to welcome you to this first session the final discussion allow me to congratulate the hellenic association for ataxia friedrich and mr karajas personally for the organization of this conference and conference which is necessary and required today because the radical developmental [Music] progress progresses and emerging treatments imposed that all the involved the parties they work together physicians patients the state and i think that this is a very clear and the perfect structure of today&amp;#39;s concurrency so let&amp;#39;s start asking the question what is the frederick&amp;#39;s attraction first of all it is a rare disease a disease that affects one in 50 000 people but the carriers of the disease are many more 1 to 7 or 90 people it is considered a classic degenerative disease with very specific characteristics either we talk about century situation and state or the movement of also there are some classes of the classical phenotype and we also have myocardiopathy scoliosis diabetes and other manifestations as well it is a rare picture of this frederick&amp;#39;s attacks and i would like to stress two things first of all i mentioned that we&amp;#39;re talking about the neurodegenerative disease but from a clinical point of view many times it is classified along with the [Music] musculoskeletal hospital together with other patients with muscular dystrophy etc and there it is quite clear that this disease is something special it is different from all the others i can mention two or three things first of all the busan dystrophy etc are aggressive in the beginning but in frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia this is something later during adolescence and the progress is not so fast the pulmonary function is a problem with the other dystrophies but later on in frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia so there are specific differences but there is also a common characteristic and this is that in these neuromuscular diseases the cooperation between many specialities required that this is something that has been set out in the spa in the guidelines about the frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia this is something that we have to talk about today whether all these guidelines are applied for the benefit of our patients another characteristic is the age of onset most of the patients with frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia are at the age of five or later on there are some patients that the onset of the disease is earlier than five years of age 80 to 90 percent of the patients we have the onset of the disease in the period from 5 to 20 years so practically what does this mean it means that we need treatment that practically addresses um all the age spectrum it means that the patients we are going to live with this disease from the childhood lessons that other lessons from adolescence to adulthood they are going to go to primary education secondary education university try to find work within these phases of their life they are going to need a specific treatment that what is this specific treatment this is something that we are going to talk about in this first lesson i would like you to ask mr dinocle hospital to take the floor and talk to us about the beginning of this disease mr dinopoulos you have the flower and also share the screen thank you very much mr karajas for the invitation it is a conference as i heard from the people that practically deal with this neurodegenerative disease and i admire it because every day we talk with families there that have a children with neurodegenerative diseases and i really hope that at the end of this conference we are going to have a fruitful conclusion to fruitful findings that are going to help these patients [Music] i&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about them [Music] the disease in childhood and some clinical characteristics of the friedrich ataxia in childhood and i use this motto because we are experiencing some very good days that we see they say that in the past could not be treated there or curable and could lead to death and nowadays we say that there are molecular techniques of genetic processing that practically can change the morbidity landscape and i really believe that very soon something will arise for predicts ataxia this is why my presentation is going to be a review primary science we see that in all of these diseases the earlier that we can apply this genetic treatment the better for the patient so the early diagnosis at the point that the child we have an accumulation practically of all the signs the symptoms of mobility skills it&amp;#39;s not unlike the other neuromuscular diseases here we have some introductory notes we were talking about a known old disease in the german and philosophy they described for the first time the symptoms says we know the maturity is practically due to effects and mutations in this means they reduce the synthesis of fraction and this gene can be expressed in the cerebellum in spinal cord hard muscle pancreas the spine and we have the various symptoms of the disease and in contrast to other diseases that practically genetically are due to to similar situations daa ah three nucleotide expansions in the engine one things are a bit different than here which is the prod is a regulator practically the nuclear symptoms they are very clearly uh described is the progressive cerebellar attraction usually observed up to the age of 15. lesions and of course relatives which is not a neurological sign but it is manifestable if [Music] you know children come to us with ataxia but at the beginning everything is uh normal here we have address nine years old that cannot take issues something that his classmates have managed years ago his mother helps him to wash his hair and cut his food and we say that progressively this child although could do all these things in the past and now she cannot control tries to adjust to the difficulties that are presented there and here we have the attacks that we see established slowly difficulties getting down the stairs in this adaxia is a cerebral and at the same time century we can see that very often here we have the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia the acronym is sarah it is used the biology nation and it is used to recognize the disease we use this tool this instrument for our patients with ataxia and of course patients with uh friedrich ataxia there are other specifications and let&amp;#39;s see this situation here you can see a tide the way that it the child works not fall down very quickly walks but there is something in his gate he&amp;#39;s not normal sometimes it goes towards the corner or a table cannot turn away [Music] sometimes we ask the child to have this type of watching something that cannot be achieved when we have the ataxia very difficult for the child to do it and in this way we assess another way to assess is the stance the posture of the body with a wide support base we have the grade 10 and we see whether a child can stand them in this way for 10 seconds as in this case you can see that is very difficult [Music] things to become more difficult when we ask the child to join the two feet together in this case there is no way a child can stand upright a more difficult things become when we have this supported base when we have incredible in this way we grade the stance then we have the sitting position the sitting position in the beginning is not affected there but later on it is affected we see that the child they hear is not affected in the sitting position normal taking position no difficulties and the assessment of the speech is important each disturbance is very important the third speech we ask the child to talk and we can see that there is another in many cases then we go to the limbs the fingertips as we call it as you can see here where the child is asked to do specific movements and we measure this material in this case then there is this material that is lower than five centimeters in the nose finger third in this tester we can assess this metric again but also tremor the specific case set between two and five centimeters another test is the test of us alternating called movement you see that there are slow movements in many cases and in this case we see that it is slightly irregular where the attack signations have this pathological abnormal manifestation in this way examine children and we can easily see if there are some early forms of attacks because as i said it is a very important to have an early diagnosis because sooner or later we are going to have some kind of treatments and we are going to hear to some specialist later on about the possible treatment for the ataxia we have used a debenham with some good results and stabilization in these tests we really hope that the gene treatment or a genetic gene modification treatment will address the problem in a more functional way and after the early diagnosis by the paediatricians as i said before that the degeneration has not progressed but would be able to treat them i really hope that this conference will give us a fruitful continuous we are experiencing a period of hope in a neurodegenerative disease i would like to thank mr democratic [Music] very informative presentation we gave us a brief and full picture of this this is it is a degenerative disease and it is very important to have the opinion of a physician for the adult patients as well and this is why we&amp;#39;re going to have mr coaches with us mr kucinis who is an assistant professor of neurology and neurogenetics thank you very much for the invitation and i feel extremely talking um but i think there are too many patients here which are greek speaking and for some of them it might not be ideal so since you have this concomitant translation i will switch to greek um sorry about this families and patients i come from the canadian hospital together with harare for many years managing the genetic department of the hospital i&amp;#39;m going to mention two more things since 2017 at the united hospital we are participating in this european registry and we see the patients prospectively we have this follow-up trying to be closer to the european activities and actions are trying it to have our patients in studies and trials and have access to various hairdressers uh neurologist cleaning at the united hospital was recognized at the center of rare diseases neurological diseases we are a member of the european reference red network and friedrichs ataxia is included in the diseases that have been certified with this framework as a rare hereditary and this is going to help our patients in the future this is the structure of my speech it&amp;#39;s quite brief the introductory elements have already been said i don&amp;#39;t want to tire you by saying the same things again and again just uh two clinical points a perhaps had to be underlined for their neurologists i&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about the epidemiology in this as these data have been collected there for the 25 years in the clinic a very brief picture of the clinical progress of the greek patients very briefly the algorithm that we use but of course the genetic and molecular approach is going to be touched upon by mrs karadima later on nicolas who was the first one to describe the disease in german and very soon she understood that it was a hereditary disease in 1996 the gene was discovered let&amp;#39;s say here that this expansion that relates that the loss of movement it is a residual disease from as you can see here just a two percent of all their taxes when we talk about the prevalence in europe it seems that it is more frequently in western europe and becomes rarer when we go towards the earth but of course this is not something specific about the clinical picture i&amp;#39;m not going to spend much time here the first symptom may not be neurological one in 50 patients the first thing that they experiences is perhaps cardiac and this is the cardiologist in the majority the first symptom is the problems of walking also the characteristic is the century here ataxia from the beginning not just a cerebellar we have a mixed ataxia and this means something practical for the neurologist as well in the first years usually do not have a cerebellar atrophy that cannot be seen in the mri and this means that sometimes the diagnosis is not very specific foreign and this is related to the number of the repetitions of their lives later smaller than 200 now at the canadian hospital we said that 1996 regime was found in 1997 we tried to have the first molecular diagnosis representing families of patients where we have residual manifestations or sporadic ataxia half of them and we see the incidence of this accented population all these years you&amp;#39;re here at the laboratory with your assistance i want to stress that the neurogenetic unity has been the only laboratory in the public health system that continuously ongoing without interruptions offers molecular diagnosis and i believe that oh we have patients here from all over greece in the first years but in the last 10 years our united power clinic plays the most important role and here you can see the cases based on the residence of the patients you can see that the disease can be found all over the territory of greece at least according to the data that wake up in a study performed some years ago patients we tried to see whether some original regions so higher prevalence there was the idea that this is the aegean islands the region of the aegean islands specifically the islands [Music] [Music] foreign was expressed in the children so we believe that there is a an increased incidence in silence for the clinical picture of the patient this based on 111 patients that i have moved in the last 24 years the gender is as you can see by the the average age that you see the patient is around the age of 25 but many of them had already been diagnosed by children&amp;#39;s neurologists around the age of 15 we have the onset of the disease 12 to 13 of the patients have a late manifestation onset of the disease you can see that the gait symptom is for all the patients babinski here as the disease progresses we have a paralysis of the legs at a certain degree this is a screenshot of the patients when we saw them but we have to follow up the patients in the years to come data here 13 patients that we have followed up for at least three years in the effects of framework and we say that this scale presented to you by bistro binoculars before has a progressive increase and there&amp;#39;s an average in three years our patients had an increase of four points in this scale last year we had england&amp;#39;s publication very much the speed of progress it depends whether the patients are abulatory or not the age as well but i think more or less the conclusions are that our patients are the same with the european patients 26 percent we have included in the effects a satisfactory number of patients and i really hope that in the future we are going to have more patients in fact a few words about the suspicion when you become suspicious that this diagnosis should be made apart from the medical history of the family um sometimes we have parents that come from the same village or ataxia has been manifested in a child another child of the family mrs aladima is going to talk to you about this but in sporadica taxes as well with onset before the age of 25. we&amp;#39;ve had more children in the family and we have only two children in the family i follow this uh applying this algorithm in a study many some years ago from the spread conditions that have announced that earlier over half of the patients we see that we can diagnose all the patients that have different the ataxia but sometimes we can using this algorithm diagnose an extra 10 percent over symptomatic patients we the conclusions are that we talk about the residual disease fxn is the gene responsibility and the repetition of this jg needs a more frequent attacks with an early onset the prevalence is one in 100 000 patients it is with some clusters possible clusters of the islands of the aegean the clinical picture of the patients in greece does not differ from other european patients it will present as this late onset freedom ataxia and we must suspect that something is wrong what we see patients with some specific symptoms after excluding other causes i would like to conclude my speech here you see there for this comprehensive presentation that is his base on their experience and i think it was very appropriate and the role that they have played in the diagnosis of ataxia unfortunately there is no time for questions perhaps at the end of the session some urgent questions may be answered now the next topic the next speaker it was mentioned by mr coaches that cardiological problems sometimes constitute that we deal with the initiation of the diagnosis but definitely at a big number of students for patients are the reasons of early mortality mr yanopoulos is the professor of pediatric cardiological at the hospital i have a mr yanoplus you have the floor good morning good to everybody it is a great pleasure and honor to be president in the hispanic health conference for friedrichshad actually i would really love to be with you but due to professional reasons for the hipaa hospital i have to be in thessalonica i would like to give my warm congratulations to mr karachi as the president who managed to together with his team to create this hellenic association of friedrichs ataxia we are talking about a very rare disease which together with the creation of this association we the doctors become better and we feel that we are not alone we need everybody we need to be together and i think what was said at the beginning of the conference is that everybody is welcome we have to fight together and all the achievements and the good results derive from collective efforts my one congratulations to mr karajas and i would like to thank him that he gave me the honor and pleasure to be together with you in this conference i think can you see the okay can you see the screen and my slides therefore we are talking about a neurodegenerative disease data creates problems to the cardiovascular this we have to talk about with neurologists and cardiologists as well and you will see which way and how important is the participation of a cardiologist in friedrichs ataxia epidemiologically lots of things have been mentioned definitely they are more common it&amp;#39;s more common in percussion and uh sub-saharan africa asia and united states one out of fifty thousand or one out of hundred thousand as it was said uh roughly we expect one two children to be born per year in greece when we have a greece with 100 births per year we expect one or two children to be born in greece roughly are these in the numbers the very interesting things were said by mr kuchis who talked to us about the island of korea because it&amp;#39;s instincts of nature everybody admires the career because they for over a hundred years and in italy you don&amp;#39;t die if you don&amp;#39;t exist 100 years old but sometimes nature reverses itself it is well known the stories of pathophysiology of the disease where we have a problem in the gene of horatoxin or frataxin with gaa naturally in a natural person this triplet has repetitions from 6 to 36 in a in ataxia frederick these repetitions go over 66 some people say more than 66 roughly what else we see more than a hundred or up to 1 700 and this is extremely significant because the diagnosis gets through the gene and we can see all these things and have to do with the prognosis of the disease as the the more serious this is more the repetitions perhaps they have one thousand two hundred one thousand seven hundred repetitions they lower this number the prognosis is better their talk we are talking about a problem destruction of metahorse and the disturbances in the production of energy they are for the mitochondrion and the consequences that we have with the cells therefore we are talking about the body fingers legs and hands dysarthria diabetes what i would say because i address children i am a cardiologist that i will undertake children&amp;#39;s ages what we start with with a clumsy child which is clumsy and i&amp;#39;m mentioning that because in pediatrics if something is out of the natural pediatricians are familiar and they always have a cardiovascular control and check there were cases where we had the diagnosis in a hyper hospital in thessaloniki from the cardiological part that is to say before ataxia was named we had the clumsy child from which we asked to have a cardiological check and immediately we have with the alarm we have the geneticist who comes to get together the puzzle parts hypertrophic and myocardiological and my [Music] that we may have we are talking about hypertrophic cardiopathy together with the neurological issues and that&amp;#39;s how we got to the diagnosis that is to stay starting with the first neurological symptoms in combination with that the pediatrician who is familiarized essential for cardiological control we had have the friedrichsha taxi and all the things that were seen by the previous speakers that the ages that we usually see then we have the majority of diagnosis at the age of 15 i believe that in the years to come this will be decreased because now we are more familiar and much more easily we can have the diagnosis and we have gene controls compared to previous years that is to say we have become wiser therefore this delay in diagnosis of previous years i believe that from now on will be much sooner better results in improving the situation of these children what we all know is that all of them will have a problem with myocardiopathy in the cases where the first diagnosis of ataxia without having cardiological tests it is self-evident that the cardiological testing will follow which in its majority will improve the existence of myocardiopathy whatever also what was nice to be said is that we may have myocardiopathy with the absence of neurological symptoms now how often does the friedrich attacks the outsiders and there are five percent which you understand is a very very small percent where we can have friedrichs ataxia with cardiovascular and have a lack of neurological symptoms we said of course earlier as regards the cardiovascular take into consideration that it is a mitochondric disturbance we have a lack of protein and this fibrous and we have uh rarely we can have asymmetric hypertrophic and even more rarer and more rarer therefore the myocardiopathy hypertrophic prevails but it&amp;#39;s not the classic one or the inherited myocardiopathy has nothing to do with the hypertrophic myocardiopathy of satasia because here we have the intervention [Music] that is to say we cannot have a blocker&amp;#39;s treatment which is the choice in the hypertrophic cardiopathy when we started with the child for example with the diagnosis of hypertrophic the first thing we did was theta blockers when we had the gene diagnosis that we have with friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia and we stop these blockers because it creates problems it is very basic to us we have become wiser in all this uh throughout the time as regards the address of the children with these cardiological problems the index of serious cardiological disease mainly is what i said that it has to do with the age the earlier we start the that we have the neurological symptoms the worse the prognosis will be and also as regards the number of the triplet repetition and this does not have to do with the neurological symptoms and the duration of the disease perhaps we have people that are at a late age and with serious neurological symptoms but they have a decreased triplet repetitions and of course it is difficult to estimate the seriousness of the cardiac participation because of the comorbidities the help that we have with the echo in very few minutes you have the diagnosis now that we are acquainted with we are very familiar in order to see things more than we used to see in the past that is microgranular and so on and so forth which which direct us guide us better in early diagnosis and treatment the mri helps quite a lot yes it is a expensive examination but mostly it will confirm to you you see this illusion it is not the hype or petrol about the fiber of this but of course we can use newer techniques in the ultrasound where we can detect the subclinical very simple test very simple tests these are clumsy children that we see they visit us and only from the city which is something very quick and you can have the diagnosis and with the sound later on so we have a characteristic sign so that you can see here conductivity disorders and this is the result of the fibrosis in the myocardium with the blocks and everything is differentiable but specifically these disorders separate activity disorders are the main characteristic now about the treatment many things have been instead as a conclusion i can say that in debian an antioxidant agent something that we work is the are the oxidative agents so don&amp;#39;t has some very good outcomes this is something to be seen later on this is the only tool that we have and of energy are some results of that that we have an improvement of the hypertrophy of the myocardium we will see later on how things will be affected i&amp;#39;m not going to require you some studies that have been established with many patients we have some positive outcomes but as you can understand many things that need to be done in order to have our final conclusions i would like to give some hope optimistic messages gene treatments say we do not have any people the first efforts that have been carried out in meister showed a reverse of the biochemical and the cellular changes in myocardiopathy but this only in mice i think that the future in medicine is going to be something extraordinary and i think that in a few years and i really believe that in the future this is something that will be quite different from what we are seeing today everything will be related to genes to genetics we will be able to intervene in these genes and have a targeted treatments the same disease in different people with these treatments in this securities and repetitions we will be able to intervene in a targeted way i believe that this is the future it&amp;#39;s going to be extraordinary and very impressive i would like again to give my congratulations that today we have the first conference on this rare disease the panchayati conference i really hope the best and wish the best for the president and the members of this association we need them we need their help thank you very much i would like to thank mr yanov for this very comprehensive presentation you gave us information about the vs aspects and you gave us some hope for the future we do not have a time for questions now you stressed that sometimes cardiology problems is the way to have the diagnosis of the patients but more frequently the orthopedics problems give us a suspicion of that this disease is now happening taking place we are going to manage these symptoms and these thank you very much allow me to start with a small story some years ago i was visited by another lesson with his family with one of the most frequent symptoms that adolescents face scoliosis one of the most common problems in other lessons and we had he had the surgery there were some other problems of neurological nature that we detected so when architected me again the diagnosis was friedrich ataxia so we have patients that visit us for orthopedic reasons and the diagnosis comes later on it is a great honor for me that i got to know these people i was i became a member of this family a family that is called the attacks of frederick and i would like to warmly congratulate mr president for everything that he has accomplished today waiting for the slides of the speaker there is always a plan b if this does not work remember in the next 10 minutes i&amp;#39;ll tell you a few things that have to do with the orthopedic problems food there is a very usual frequent test that we use for these people that includes the support on a block so if the heal is corrected we talk about the flexible malformation otherwise we&amp;#39;re talking about the rigid malformation so children and adolescents with these problems when they suffer from ataxia or black very usually they also suffer from pain due to the problems of the legs also pain on the outer surface of the hood because usually they walk in a very a peculiar way and this means that there is on the surface of the foot on the lower surface of the foot at the same time not so frequent they&amp;#39;re going to be pale in other parts of the food now the way that we&amp;#39;re going to approach a patient that suffers from all these problems depends on the severity of malformation whether there are symptoms other symptoms as well from the ataxia and whether we talk about an ambulatory patient or not we in married cases we use an affection which is placed inside the shoe sometimes we can choose to have a surgical procedure for patients that are in a more severe cases and depending on the severity of the problem we try to correct the problems that exist in the joint or the various parts of the food of course i&amp;#39;m talking about ambulatory patients but usually the food is neglected the investigations now when we talk about the spine small formations we have two categories and when we have the scoliosis and or key forces according to the international medical literature the spinal malformation in these children with attacking for frederick ranges from 63 to 100 percent 63 percent is mentioned by a study or based on a dna test in younger children so this incident is reduced practically the incident is higher than 63 percent closer to 90 to 100 percent so this attack is scoliosis is manifested a few years after the axia and affects both genders it is very interesting that scoliosis in attacking friedrich is combined risk force is something that is not very common when we have radiopathic scholar system which is the most frequent one in a big number of cases one third of the patients that have malformation of the spine are not going to require a specific method of treatment treatment is required when we have a progressive determination of the malformation and this is usually for children when the scoliosis is um diagnosed before the age of 15 and in the children with attacks before the age of them all formations that we see in the spine in children with an axial fabric are radiologically similar to the ones that we see in idiopathic malformations of the spine and this is something that confuses us that&amp;#39;s happened in the case of artists that i mentioned in the beginning an exception is the malformations that we see in other neurological diseases that lead to the displacement of the body in one whole one direction as i said 45 to 70 percent scissors is combined with surfaces a very specific characteristic is that we have a left authority probably said compared to the right ones that we see in other idiopathic scholars attacks medication to be used and the surgical procedures that can be used malformations a guardian is used when we have malformation of something 25 to 50 degrees but also in children or other lessons and not have cannot undergo surgical procedure due to the but it problems that the children actually traded the guardian is not effective it is not going to affect the degenerative progress of the disease so we see a deterioration of the malformation inside the cabin now about the imaging have an assessment evaluation of the spine because the spike can affect the way that the head is a hole is held and the heat as sometimes we have in the mri the entropy which is shown so the city&amp;#39;s khan is very useful for us for children that have a big degree of malformation and this can help us in order to design the surgical procedure it is very important to have a good cooperation with audiologists children&amp;#39;s cardiologists that are going to assess sometimes we have problems with the lungs as well and of course we have to exclude the possibility of diabetes relatives that could affect the respiratory procedure when we have over 50 degrees malformation the surgeon must be aware of the problems that might exist opening up for example for children that use a wheelchair and urology problems and something very specific is the absence of reduction of the sensory potentials that we see during the surgical procedure what does this practical mean during the surgical procedure we have the corrections carried out neurologist is present in the operating room giving us some potentials in order to record the function of the spinal cord unfortunately this cannot be done in these children with a taxi of frederick this is something that we can overcome in recent years with the recording of the potential and the possibility to place the inserts the graphs are very accurate robotic now in these children we have to include every curvature and when we have a child that is not a military we have to expand our procedure up to the hip so that the correct position is given to the child the sitting on the wheelchair again it was a great honor to be here today with you thank you very much for his speech that said lighter to all the problems orthopedic problems that might exist for these patients and their quality of life as i said we do not have time for questions so i would like to ask the last speaker mrs karadima assistant professor in biology neurogenesis at the united hospital to develop us the position of genetics in guiding these patients thank you very much the association for the invitation to be a speaker in the fairness conference i would like to ask and we say this is the introduction i&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about the contribution of the neurogenetic in the diagnosis and study of the attacks of frederick in greek patients these these are some limitations and this is the outline of the presentation i&amp;#39;m going to give you some genetic information about the gene and in the end i&amp;#39;m going to focus on the capabilities and the possibilities that we have at our unit now and in the future about the diagnosis provision of assistance both for the patients and their families cell is the subunit of the body and we can see it only through specific tools in the nucleus of each cell we have the genetic material the dna this dna is stored in 23 chromosomes chromosome pairs and we have there&amp;#39;s the genes that have the quantifying information about the proteins required by our body in this slide you can see the 23 chromosome pairs 22 uh auto summary once again chromosomes exactly the same and here we have the gene which is responsible for the ataxia of what we drive here we see the fratrax indian five code regions these are red boxes were codified we have the information in order to create the protracting protein between the boxes one and two the actions we have the repetition g a a you can send the picture and when we have variation of this repetition when we have more than 66 repetitions this gene is abnormal pathogen for the person that carries it and it has to be mutated in both chromosomes because we&amp;#39;re talking in ataxia of food life about a monosomal recessive disease than 66 repetitions we are talking about the normal pain more than 66 we have the abnormal one this is related to 96 percent of the ataxia of rhythmical cases in very rare cases we have this we have point mutations these red boxes one nucleotide to change in one of them in this case these people have in one chromosome the abnormal repetition of gia and the other chromosome they have a point detection so we&amp;#39;re talking about a combinational heterozygotes the more repetitions we have the more severe the symptoms and the earlier the age of the onset of the disease disease so we have the gia replacement increase the repetition for gaa more than 66. the jingle stops functioning throtoxin protein is the production of this protein is blocked and protracting the protein is very important to have the function of utochondrium we&amp;#39;re talking about very small formations inside the cell generating energy when we do not have energy generated the cell cannot function so there is a necrosis so the fratroxin gene is expressed in the cardiac tissue neurological tissue the pancreas so the most common clinical signs focus on these specific issues now 1997 and onwards we understood and discovered the gene and saw the mutations related to the disease and with the progress of the molecular medicine and the genetics we can now detect the disease in the dna of each person so we can provide genetic control both from the patients and the normal carriers of the disease so we start from the clinician from the guidelines of the international literature will be applied in order to detect the errors in the fraternity gene 96 percent of the cases the key error is the g a a repetition of action one and in some cases we have point mutations so the laboratory protocols are a big picture and multiplication of the region that includes this uh three nucleotide repetition ortho that has another axis that we use them in order to detect this three nucleotide repetition whether the sunken sequencing reading one by one of the bases of the codifying regions is used in order to determine the very rare point mutations and in this way to find the combined heterozygote hospital since 1997 today 619 genetic controls have been performed 111 cases were possibly for a taxi of frederick and 102 were normal carriers now they got we&amp;#39;re talking about then autosomal reception disease which means that for a person chromosomes must be mutated these children as a ruler come from parents as you can see here man and a woman are a normal parent as you can see in their chromosomes 25 possibilities the first child at actual freedom 50 to have children that are going to be carriers who have the mutational in one of the chromosomes and 25 percent that have two normal chromosomes it is a key to see to examine the carriers when we have a family of which a member has attacks of frederick the parents and the siblings must be controlled it is very important when we have a scheduled pregnancies pre-metal control and plaster must be carried out and this is the only way to prevent the transfer of the mutated gene in the next generations and this is a way to abolish the disease increase the incidence of the disease as you&amp;#39;ve heard from the previous species when there is some kind of affinity between the parents and the common origin so in our unit most of you know it because you have visited us you will have especially clinic genetics at clinic and neuro kinetic care laboratory these are combined and cooperated so in the end we can have a timely and valid diagnosis we provide consultancy genetics consultancy and follow-up for our patients in the last four years we have radical developments in the western neurology clinic of for rare diseases for greater population in 2020 the first neurologic clinic was included in the european networks for rare neurology diseases and of course the attacks of free life is included in one of them and of course in effect in the last four years evian also is a research program that started by stefan two years ago aiming at providing genetic diagnosis and clinical diagnosis free of charge for the greek population and genetic control of rare neurological diseases and because there is but because there is a panceline network we believe that in the future it will be included finally apart from all this if you&amp;#39;re worried about the tests that are qualitatively certified by a european network and in the last years the cooperation or between us and the laboratory of neurogenetics in cycles we have a collaboration and confirmation of the results in the future we are going to have a great development in our laboratory because we are inspecting specific instruments for targeted the non-targeted dna analysis test many genes are going to be tested using new generation sequencing automated um instrument for dna isolations and this means that the results are going to be more coordinated and sooner than what is happening now the space that we have in the laboratory is expanded by 25 square meters for the new instrument and computing after one year the euro jetting cell laboratory to get their national certification and i would like to thank mr karatas and your association for the help provided for the calibration of the instruments and the machines that we use one of the many tests that we have to take in order to get the certifications thank you very much for your attention whatever happens new medicine i am optimistic about new treatments but in order to eliminate the disease if the screening the genetic screening is included in the prenatal test of a person that wants a child in the family this is a procedure which is not very expensive and we have a radical outcome thank for the excellent presentation and the information she gave us which plays a decisive role as i said we do not have questions time for questions i would like to thank all the speakers and i think it was confirmed it was confirmed that the level of provision of services in our country as regards see uh free dry cataxia is great thank you very much for the thank you thank you mr mercedes mr coaches mrs karadima very important contribution in today&amp;#39;s event i think the fact that we came to one o&amp;#39;clock shows the interest because we have people from australia and the united states therefore we should be on time therefore i know that you are tired but let&amp;#39;s give a stretch for five minutes and then we change the panel into a carrion thank you very much hey very sensitive for children we would like to thank them for the efforts there is a campaign of the european parliament for the protection of children for children&amp;#39;s abuse and she coordinates the natural action plan for sexual abuse i would like to thank for the invitation we wish you good fruitful conference i am here as a coordinator from the european council for sexual children&amp;#39;s abuse to sensitize and make people aware with all the tools we have from the european parliament so that we can teach the children all the golden rules that the european council says we talk to them about their body all the related dishes and now we have a new cartoon story where the protagonist is on a wheelchair so that we can protect the more vulnerable children children our aim is to stand by them listen to them so that they know how they can avoid the situation that may lead them to a difficult situation but make parents aware to be careful with the emotions of our children you know a real name in sexual abuse comes from the family environment of the child knows the person or trusts and perhaps we know this person if we trust especially one out of five children in europe we have sexual abuse in greece this is 16 and only 2 out of 100 children break their silence because their feelings are mixed the person that they love and trust creates harm to them at the same time they love them but they don&amp;#39;t want it for this thing to carry on we through the informative tools to try to urge children to speak but at the same time the state has a national action plan with the initiative of the prime minister which is for the protection of children&amp;#39;s sexual abuse and for this action plan 11 ministries cooperate because we have to have specific policies that will help us so that we can restructure the institutional operations become children friendly and help towards this direction with the thought that the informed children are safe we continue the sensitization and awareness campaign i will leave the informative material so that it can reach your children and i will be here to stand by in your efforts as a member of parliament and at the same time in any other field that may be necessary thank you very much for your attention it&amp;#39;s time to go to the second panel to talk about the clinical research and innovative treatment i am very glad that we have we women have a saying and it is proved by all of you that you are here and every day at the place of your work the next coordinator which is evangelion head in the hematological clinic of the and associate professor at the washington concierge university in a dream treatment under your business professor and when she returned in greece she set up the program in the hospital papanikola she spends time into transplanted patients trying to have clinical finances findings new therapies and treatments you have the floor thank you very much i am glad that i welcome you into this session which i think we all expect since it mentions to the innovative treatments for free it is a great honor to share this session i would like to thank mr garagias for this honorary invitation to help thank him also for the ability that he gives me to get to know the disease i only remember it from my student here and his devotion to the disease and the effort for treatment mobilized me as well as a scientist that has to do with gene treatment [Music] and from now on we are planning with other researchers in missalani to be able to approach from our side the gene therapy for this disease speaker in english therapist [Music] ataxia and we have a distinguished speaker with us uh dr dre mirella rody gagnes [Music] doctor sir chris stefani and dr mendes george um dr dre uh mendes and uh sir we will be uh join will join us virtually uh dr rodick is with us here and i would like without any further delay to start i will start um i will um i will switch to brick now uh second basically for gene treatment in order to understand a non-scientific audience to understand what we are going to hear later on ataxia fibre is a rare disease but what we call rare diseases and how rare are they in reality rare diseases characterized by the is considered that 60 people in the united states 15 europe 75 in china per 100 000 people and these are chronic diseases many times difficult which can affect every system in the human body however for the rare diseases the interesting thing from from research groups is not particularly high as you really understand etsy therefore for more rare diseases in reality they represent a non-fulfilled medical media rare disease perhaps the term is it not is disorienting if we consider that more than 7 000 rare diseases that affect over 400 million people all over the world and these numbers are increasing since new rare diseases are recognized and characterized the gene therapy theoretically could correct any uh gene disease and and the proof of concept has shown up with the gene treatment we can have results the term for gene treatment is that we are talking about a biological product which comprises from a combined dna and it is used in the human brains in order to correct to replace to add or to eliminate a genetic mutation or not depending on the target where the final target is to treat or to address diseases gene genetical problems the gene treatment is a new medical practice it is as regards to basic access the first axis is that compatible medicine acts by changing the phenotype the patient has to have the treatment by [Music] exogenously and also chemotherapy however creates many problems on the other hand the gene treatment is a holistic way of addressing the problem since it targets the root of the disease and gene but there is a mutated it can be transferred to the cell and this ideally comes done with a gene correction in c2 or alternatively with gene addition then the underlying disease can be corrected the other side which shows that the real in reality gene treatment is a new maybe medical practice is the fact that the new era in the treatment where we have been in has changed the traditional model of the drugs which is not produced massively standardized but the raw material derives from the patient and the end product ends up to the patient it&amp;#39;s a customized treatment and it is not a drug that is going to be metabolized we are talking about uh live cells for they remain there for the rest of the people&amp;#39;s life that&amp;#39;s why we are talking about live drugs therefore it is a new medical product at this point we have to point out that the gene treatment intervenes only in somatic cells and not in reproduction cells we don&amp;#39;t want to create generally generations of mutated people only in the issue that it has a problem in order to create a phenotype and not to correct to correct a natural life how does it work the gene treatment it works what is based on viruses that become inactive takes place by removing the structural elements of the virus and in their place we have the natural gene this natural gene is enters viral vector enters and monitors the divisions in the cells but also to have the expression of the virus in long term otherwise will remain [Music] but that does not guarantee the expression how is it delivered either treatment is used when it is easily accessible the cells as you can see here in vivo is used when the target cells are not easily accessible like the lungs liver muscles etc here with an extreme treatment example for mediterranean anemia for example the target the cells are removed from the patient are corrected and then returned to the patient after the patient takes a preparation it is a chemotherapy that we want there to destroy [Music] very simple procedure for the patient the viral vector is used immediately in these cases you will use the serotypes of the viruses that show tropism towards many tissue there are two basic ways the traditional the classical type of genetic treatment addition of the gene in the target cell using some viral vectors so the viral vector is going to be incorporated inserted in a non-predictable way and a normal gene remains with a mutated gene but the protein that is generated produced is normal the technology of genetic processing has been advanced in recent years and in this way we can target the relation site we use some nucleus is specific for the targeted side these nucleuses that act as a molecular scissors and with the nucleuses and the guide molecule that leads us to the target point target we have the correction of this target mutation the differences of these two approaches are that the target site is predetermined here is not predictable another way a combination with the hemopeptic cells technology we have the possibility to reprogram them by putting them in a culture with a cocktail constitutional agencies so we get them into a nearly developmental stage and in this state we have to correct the genetic dimension the genetic damage also to have an enriched population of the genetic cells to be transplanted and the other voice is at this stage to have a differentiation of these cells the abnormal gene so we have an env the cell the rich population of the disease itself and with the 3d cultures we can model the disease and choose new drugs for these types department target diseases are many genetic treatments started there for genetic diseases but later on acquired businesses were added because medication of a gene or the intervention on a gene can have a disease a modification modified effect and reprogram the specificity of the cell 40 years have gone by since the beginning of genetic treatment and nowadays we have excellent clinical results and outcomes and many drugs for rare diseases that have been approved by the various institutions and the genetic treatments and nowadays we have many successful reasons in a variety of diseases as we can see some of which the ones that we have approved products of genetic treatment and i confused by saying that as a president of the association of genetic treatment and the reparative medicine we support the research for rare diseases you can see that in the program allowing the agenda of our conference on the 27th of may 28th and we are all invited there to participate second speaker she&amp;#39;s dr tori mirela she&amp;#39;s an um associate professor and principal uh fellow um in imagine institute she leads the research group on mitochondrial diseases oh sorry [Laughter] i apologize sorry for that mirela so mirella dottori is a principal research fellow at the illawarra health and medical research institute at the university of wallop in australia her research focuses um in human stem cells to develop models for studying the nervous system and also to develop therapies for neurodegenerative diseases and in particular for dry cataxia so uh mirela the stage is yours thank you very much i&amp;#39;ll just share my screen and please be a moment sorry can you see that okay um okay so firstly i would like to thank um the um the the possibility to speak today this meeting i&amp;#39;m sorry i can&amp;#39;t speak greek i really wish i could but um yeah thank you very much it&amp;#39;s a great honor to be presenting at this meeting so with this um brief talk i&amp;#39;m really going to be speaking mainly about and the overview of the research direction our lab is taking in terms of for frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia and so sorry i will just move on so when we think about different therapies for fa the ideal scenario obviously is to basically correct the mutation because that is the the critical thing causing it is that gaa expansion and obviously the new technology is moving forward with this in particular in crispr technologies the other approach is obviously to deliver frataxin and there are our group and other groups around the world working on this as well in particular looking at different delivery systems and it could be using a viral approach as we&amp;#39;ve just heard before from embellishers you&amp;#39;ve introduced that really well as well as obviously nanoparticles the next level approach is to then um potentially promote cellular health in particular the cells that are degenerating or to prevent further degeneration and progression of the disease and a lot of these approaches in therapies are looking at in particular antioxidants or other compounds that may endogenously increase frataxin levels and finally there is also the possibility potentially for some tissues for tissue replacement and in that case would be transplantation the reason that i&amp;#39;m highlighting all of these approaches is just to show you that stem cells can feed into each of these because stem cells offers a really useful platform to test these different therapeutic avenues in a more high throughput system before you go into the human and patients so when again to this audience my apologies how i&amp;#39;m pitching it some may have a great understanding of stem cells and others that may be new but i thought to sort of go back to some of the basics so really when we define a stem cell obviously it&amp;#39;s a cell that can proliferate to give rise to self and also a cell that completely afraid to give rise to a specialized cell are relevant to that tissue now there&amp;#39;s many different types of stem cells in the body those that give rise to the hemopodic system the bone marrow and and so forth but the ones that we work in the lab are these induced pluripotent stem cells and these stem cells are actually artificially created even though they&amp;#39;re derived from human tissue or in patient cases so this was technology that was developed around 2006 by professor shinya yamanaka in japan and then there was also other groups involved in the us and he got a nobel prize for this work in 2012 because it really was a game changer for modern medicine mainly for disease modeling so very briefly and again i could although i don&amp;#39;t understand greek i could see the slides before that you already introduced this concept but the technology behind this is that essentially can take human tissue usually we use skin cells it can use even fat cells or blood cells and introduce four or five different genes or proteins um in the past we used to use viruses but now there&amp;#39;s many other approaches that essentially these four or five proteins the combination of them converts we say reprograms these skin cells to become into a pluripotent state so this word pluripotent means that these cells have the capability to give rise to all cell types of the body and essentially they&amp;#39;re mimicking embryonic stem cells that you find in a particular stage of the blastocyst which would give rise to the um to the baby or the the whole human body so once they&amp;#39;re in a pluripotent state then in the dish we can then drive them into different cell types of of the body that we may be interested in and you can appreciate this technology is really powerful because we can do a lot with these cells we can genetically edit them to either correct the mutations we can introduce new mutations to understand the disease obviously use different cell types for drug scheme screening and for some diseases in some scenarios you can transplant them back into the patient as they&amp;#39;re moving forward for parkinson&amp;#39;s disease so when this technology came about our group and also other groups around the world um quickly move forward into this technology to develop frederic&amp;#39;s ataxia ips cell lines so in our lab alone we&amp;#39;ve got about at least 13 different phrygics ataxia stem cell lines and obviously there&amp;#39;s other stem cell lines around the world and the main lineages that we&amp;#39;re focused on working on and this is also with other collaborations in australia is the main tissues main cell types affected in their pha so that&amp;#39;s the cardiomyocytes um relevant to the heart tissue then we&amp;#39;ve got all the different brain cell types in particular the cerebellar neurons and then in my lab in particular we&amp;#39;re primarily interested in the dorsal ganglia sensory neurons so this is where the proprioceptive neurons are found the which are the neurons the sensory neurons that are innervating the muscle that are sensing feeling and it&amp;#39;s these neurons as well as this um cerebellar neurons that are one of the primary sites of degeneration that begins in fa so this is just to show you you know the basic concept where you can essentially go from skin to stem cells to neurons and these neurons that you end up in the dish essentially have the same genetic background of where they came from so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost like the same cell type that&amp;#39;s converted to different stages and and different different properties so why use stem cells for screening well obviously there&amp;#39;s you know a lot of value but one of the main things to highlight is that one same that one cell lineage you&amp;#39;re working with you can differentiate into the multiple lineages so you can have the cardiomyocytes you can have cerebellar neurons you can have the dorsal ganglia sensory neurons so you have a really nice platform looking at different cell types but again with the same genetic basis and and other properties obviously because it&amp;#39;s an ongoing resource you can make multiple patient lines with varying genetic backgrounds different gaa repeats and different um phenotypes you would say in reflecting different disease progression and obviously they&amp;#39;re quite a valuable resource for high throughput you know screens for different therapies so for this talk i&amp;#39;m just going to give again a very basic overview how we&amp;#39;re using stem cells to look at differential gene delivery systems for delivering protection into the body so again it was it was really presented very well in the previous slides as i could see from from from what i saw that gene therapy is very much an umbrella word for meaning many different types of approaches it can be x fever where you genetically manipulate the cells and then transplant those cells into the body or it can be directly in vivo where you actually use viruses or nanoparticles to deliver the gene into different target tissues now of this as you can imagine like all technologies the many different parts that you need to work on at the same time to get it all right and with gene therapy one of the main things to get right is actually the delivery system so how you&amp;#39;re going to deliver frataxin then there&amp;#39;s other issues as well on how much rataxin to give and how to actually deliver frataxin to the right cell type and also into the mitochondria now we&amp;#39;re quite fortunate in our lab that we&amp;#39;ve been funded both from farrah usa and also from the australian government to look at diff a multi-pronged approach different delivery systems in particular the nanoparticles or using associated adenoviruses or viruses so with um no matter which approach you take whether it&amp;#39;s nanoparticles or viruses or different types of viruses the key thing about the delivery system um to appreciate is that every cell in the body has its unique signature and will only allow certain things in and others it won&amp;#39;t allow in and so when you&amp;#39;re trying to develop a delivery system you have to think well what will preferentially deliver this gene into this cell type and not others so what is particular about the particular nerve cell and there&amp;#39;s so many different types of nerve cells with all different properties which will allow frataxin to get into this particular nerve but avoid the liver for example so this is where again stem cells offers a really good platform to screen for these sorts of things so with the case of looking at nanoparticles so we collaborate with the group from university of melbourne professor frank caruso who&amp;#39;s a bioengineer and dr christina cortez-hugo and we&amp;#39;ve been this is a fara-funded project both usa and australia and where we&amp;#39;ve been using basically these stem cells or sensory neurons to screen different nanoparticles but the things that i&amp;#39;d really i&amp;#39;m not going to show data but i just want you to appreciate the concepts behind this so nanoparticles are usually engineered constructs but they can be also naturally occurring and there&amp;#39;s many different types of materials that can be used in the nanoparticles so you the ones that we&amp;#39;ve particularly looked at are silica based nanoparticles even gold nanoparticles or you may be familiar with the lipid nanoparticles which where the covert vaccine was used to deliver the mrna there&amp;#39;s also different ways in which you can assemble the nanoparticle itself so it&amp;#39;s not just the particle but different approaches we&amp;#39;ve looked at was saying layer by layer so the core of the particles that was silica but the external part of the composition of the nanoparticles it was a different sort of material which may again allow better accessibility to certain cells then you can have different nanoparticle sizes as well as the extracellular features which are charged and then as i mentioned you can also have naturally occurring nanoparticles so for example we looked at glycogen which is a natural metabolite that your body makes and some of these natural metabolites you can also engineer and modify in order to attach say the dna of interest the gene or the mrna so that it can get enter into the cell and the strong advantage of nanoparticles is that it&amp;#39;s not just about delivering dna obviously they can be used to deliver mrna again thinking about the covert vaccine they can also be modified to deliver proteins or particular drugs so the bottom line with nanoparticles is that they give us the greatest flexibility for screening to look at different components to deliver protection to different tissues however because it&amp;#39;s a double-edged sword because you&amp;#39;ve got all those different variations the screening takes longer so over the years we&amp;#39;ve been working with as i said these bioengineers and looking at different nanoparticle types different nanoparticle sizes charges particle densities the way they&amp;#39;re assembled and we&amp;#39;ve been using our sensory neurons derived from fa patients as a platform we&amp;#39;ve been culturing them in 3d and 2d to screen the various types and we&amp;#39;ve obtained some quite promising results with different compounds like silica based small nanoparticles and glycogen and then however i would like to flag that also when we then go to the vivo model when we test these in say animals we see sometimes quite different results so what we may see in the dish doesn&amp;#39;t always necessarily translate to what we see in vivo and that makes sense because in the body you&amp;#39;ve got the immune system you&amp;#39;ve got even in the nervous system you&amp;#39;ve got glia they can soak up different things so that&amp;#39;s okay because that&amp;#39;s the approach we take so we do all our screening in this in in our stem cell based cell types then we go to new vivo if it doesn&amp;#39;t work we go back to our platform and look at and screen the next candidates so just because it doesn&amp;#39;t always translate it&amp;#39;s not necessarily a bad thing it actually validates the purpose of having a an in vitro screening platform um to fast-track this to then choose the top candidates for the in vivo scenario for the animal studies so the second approach as i mentioned is looking at viruses in particular the adenoviruses this is work that was very recently funded only last year so again it&amp;#39;s still early days and i&amp;#39;m just going to highlight the con the approach that we&amp;#39;re taking so basically there&amp;#39;s three main aims and this is a quite a large scaled project um involving many collaborators across australia and a lot of different expertise and i myself don&amp;#39;t have expertise in um in adenoviruses but we&amp;#39;re collaborating with some doctor leslie from university of sydney who&amp;#39;s our you know virus guru who advise us on everything so again with adenoviruses there are many that are being used in clinical trials at the moment but those of you who are familiar with this technology are aware that as with these aavs there&amp;#39;s many different types and they definitely have different preference into which different tissues they can target so with our collaborators what we&amp;#39;re doing is we have these different libraries and kits so we&amp;#39;re screening one is an aav testing kit so in this kit there&amp;#39;s at least 70 different aavs which are at the moment available some are being used in clinical trials and that and some are being used in the lab and we&amp;#39;re using those to screen our different stem cell platforms to see which ones preferentially get into the cell in parallel we&amp;#39;re also screening libraries of bioengineered aavs so these have been randomly mutated in different ways particularly at the casper that is the external part of the virus that determines where it how it transfects into what cells it transfects into and we&amp;#39;re using the same cells as the screening platform now both the kits and these libraries have been barcoded so they&amp;#39;ve been genetically modified so like when you go to the supermarket and you go through the screening and every product has its barcode so the idea is that we transduce infect ourselves with these different libraries and the ones in which and they&amp;#39;re carrying a gfp protein a green fluorescent protein and the ones which show to be efficiently infecting the cells we&amp;#39;re able to isolate by fact sorting sequence it and then and then identify which particular adenovirus type whether it&amp;#39;s by an engineered one or one that&amp;#39;s available was preferential in efficient in transfecting that cell type this will take two or three rounds but we from there we will get our top candidates as i mentioned the main platforms that we&amp;#39;re using is the cardiomyocyte so this is in collaboration with dr max lim from saint vincent&amp;#39;s institute in melbourne and he has beautiful models of using using the same stem cell lines as we have in making cardiac organoids so these are tissue-like structures that are mimicking the cardiac you also can introduce vascular cells and neural cells into there and has beautiful functional assays to measure activity um the other collaborators with dr sam naylor from queensland um in australia and he has developed the technology to make cerebellar organoids so as you know in fa the main region of the brain mainly affected is the dentate nuclear nucleus within the cerebellum so um sam has been able to derive these cell types from these stem cells and make them into these little organoid-like structures and what&amp;#39;s nice is that in his um organoids he has identified quite a large proportion of the relevant nuclei that neurons that we&amp;#39;re interested in which is the deep cerebellar nuclei and then in my lab we&amp;#39;re interested as i mentioned is in the dorsal ganglis sensory neurons and again i don&amp;#39;t have time to go into all this data but there are different types of one sensing pain the one sensing skin for touch and feeling and the others are the proprioceptors that innervate the muscle and we over the years have developed a lot of protocols and expertise in deriving these cell types in the dish and also just to highlight that it&amp;#39;s not just about getting these sensory neurons as a whole we&amp;#39;re also really gearing in and we just recently were fortunate to get funding from farah to look at this deeper where we able to derive a more pure population particularly of these propriocene sensory neurons again these are the large sensory neurons that innervating the muscle that are one of the primary neurons that um that are degenerating so we&amp;#39;re using these cell types in in our screens and this is again preliminary data but just to show you um that again in our pro initially we&amp;#39;re doing these screens as i mentioned with the green fluorescent protein because we need this to be high throughput to extract it through um through i identifying the appropriate cells that have been infected so that we can isolate them and sequence them and we&amp;#39;re getting um interesting results you know some are consistent some are different across the different cell types and different platforms and then once we&amp;#39;ve chosen our top say you know three to five candice there&amp;#39;s still more work to be done so there&amp;#39;s the the second part is to look at the dosing of the virus again to verify the efficiency of transfecting that cell type also a virus may be great in you know infecting the cell but it may not be ideal for manufacturing purpose and that&amp;#39;s where we give it to our collaborators in sydney and they&amp;#39;ve got a lot of experience in in this area we also in the dish can see how well or poorly these cells interact with antibodies within the within the immune system because obviously we don&amp;#39;t want an immune reaction so we can help avoid that by screening for that in the dish and one of the main parts of this same as well is to specifically look at the liver because the liver is an organ that mops up a lot of things that you ingest in particular viruses as well as nanoparticles so we collaborate with another group again from university of melbourne who has works in liver cancer and a lot of expertise in making liver organoids from patient cells so once we&amp;#39;ve derived our top candidates we will screen these aavs in these liver organoids to see the ones that do not actually infect the liver so it&amp;#39;s a negative screen and then finally once we get through that part obviously it&amp;#39;s all about frataxin and so that&amp;#39;s we will choose our top candidates introduce frataxin into the candidate top aavs and then perform similar studies in our stem cell models and going much deeper obviously looking at mitochondrial outcomes and also functional outcomes and we have a quite a bit of expertise in that area to look at that and just to wind it all up the things that we really are facing now as we&amp;#39;re entering in this work um in particular gene therapy is and again many of you may already appreciate that it&amp;#39;s not just about delivering for a taxi but a key thing is how much for a tax and because i say it&amp;#39;s the goldilocks amount you don&amp;#39;t want too little obviously but you also don&amp;#39;t want too much so what is the right amount and how do you regulate that so we&amp;#39;re having ideas we&amp;#39;re collaborating with dr marek naparella who&amp;#39;s worked on the and promoter that helps regulate protection levels and see if we can incorporate that in obviously as i&amp;#39;ve highlighted translating these studies in the dish to human is always a challenge but we&amp;#39;ve got already in place with that collaborators different primate models to sort of address that and then a big thing is the delivery approach so you have to think do you just you know inject it directly into the regions of the brain or do you or the in the cardiac tissue or is it through you know intramuscular or iv again they&amp;#39;re things that we need to consider and one of the main things that obviously the fara community is very much aware is readout so we can measure readouts in the dish changes in mitochondria but again when it comes to clinical trials it is key to even pick up subtle differences and over time to see what we see in the dish how does that translate into humans and it&amp;#39;s and even like subtle changes in it could be as simple as picking up a cup you know something like that so that&amp;#39;s sort of like the overview of our work like i said it&amp;#39;s more about the approach and different things to think about um and where i&amp;#39;m coming from is more about the using um the model approach to hopefully fast track these therapies as quickly as possible to the to the clinic and all of this work couldn&amp;#39;t be done without the excellent teamwork across everywhere with everyone and of course funding from um farah and also the australian government with the mrf stem cell mission so thank you for your attention oh sorry i shall stop screaming we thank dr tortori for the very nice talk and the uh nice data should we go on with a second okay and the questions will be at the end right okay so our next speaker she is with us so uh dr rodriguez as his associate so she&amp;#39;s a research director at insurance at imagine institute in france and she will talk to us on [Music] the role of iron in the mitochondrial protein frataxin and how the cellular iron homeostasis is maintained or is disturbed in this condition thank you first first of all i would like to to thank you especially to thank you karazakis for this very kind invitation to this first conference so uh i&amp;#39;m work i&amp;#39;m working in imaging institute in in paris which is in naked hospital my group is working on mitochondrial disorders and we have a very special interest to free cataxia and i will present you relatively recent results that will be the starting point for clinical trial so it&amp;#39;s uh i must say that the function of frataxin is very difficult to understand and more specifically the consequences of the frataxin defects are very wide and complicated and i will try to show you a small part of this consequences and i will try also to make it very simple because it&amp;#39;s relatively difficult to explain so as you know frataxin is a mitochondrial proteins this proteins here is shown here is located in the mitochondrial matrix and it is mainly mainly involved in the biogenesis of iron sulfur clusters these ion sulfur clusters will then be associated with different proteins some of these proteins stay in the mitochondria and some iron sulfur clusters exist from the mitochondria and will be associated with other proteins so it means that a defect of frataxin will result in a defect of several proteins inside the mitochondria and outside the mitochondria you know that patients with fluid cataxia accumulates iron in the brain and in the heart and we were interested in the reason of this iron accumulation and before to show you what happens in french ataxia i will explain you very briefly the major what are the major actors involved in iron homeostasis in the same first of all iron enter into the cells mainly by the fratoxin by the transferrin receptor the iron which is the green spot here are linked to transferrin that transferred the iron and this transferrin binds to the transferrin receptor that allows the iron to enter into the cell the ion can also enter into the cells via different transporters that are called non-transparent bond ion ntbi and then after entering the cells the iron is stored in a in a protein which is called ferritin and this is very important because iron is very toxic but so he it has to be protected the cells has to be protected from the ion and in the same times the the a lot of reaction and function in the cells need iron so there is very important to have a very good equilibrium that maintain the appropriate amount of iron into the cells that make the entry that regulate the entry the storage and the exit of the iron and finally the iron exit from the from the cells using the ferro protein which is another protein so the regulation that of the iron content is very well known since very long time and briefly it it allows that in low iron conditions there is increased transparent receptor protein here that allows iron uptake and decreased ferritin to limit the iron storage to make it available and decrease ferroprotein that limit the iron exit on the contrary in high iron conditions the transparent receptor is decreased limiting the iron uptake but the ferritin is increased to lows iron storage and the ferro protein also is increased to allow the iron exit and this will make the amount of iron correctly regulated in the cells so as there is iron accumulation in brain and heart of patients with certain cataxia we decided to measure the iron content in fibroblasts of patients which is a relatively easy cells to obtain and to grow so as you can see here we measure the iron content of fibroblasts from three controls and five patients and we did the experiments in fibroblasts with no iron with always high iron concentration in the gross medium and as you can see here the tree control cells increase a little bit the iron content when grown in high iron content but in the fridge ataxia patients fibroblasts there is a very important amount of iron that suggests that these cells are totally unable to limit the iron uptake and we then wanted to understand this mechanism and we first focused on the transgene receptor first of all we observed that the transferrin receptors accumulates in fibroblasts of chronic ataxia patients you can see here a picture of the cell in which we have as blue the nucleus and in green the transverse receptor and you can see that there is a very higher signal for transferring receptors in patient cells compared to control cells we then we then try to understand the the reason of this accumulation of transferring receptor and to make a very long story short what we learn is that transferrin receptors as several other proteins can undergoes modification and one of this modification is the addition of palmitate which is a fatty acid and this modification is called palmitoylation so the transferrin receptor here is shown after addition of this palmitate which is the punitive relation not only transferring receptor but also the non-transverse bone iron transporter the ntbi transporter also undergo parameterization and this parameter relation is very important to modify the traffic of the protein in the cells and this is important for these transporters because they come from the cell membrane and they have to go inside the the cells and then to go back to the membrane so palmitoylation is very important for this type of protein so it modified the traffic and of course also their localization what we observed is that in frederick ataxia fibroblasts there is a decreased parameterization of transparent receptor and also on the anterior transporter and because of that we this results in accumulation of transverse receptors at the same membrane which induce iron uptake because the transverse receptor is stacked at the cell membrane and continue to import iron and of course of iron overload so this is one of the reason of the abnormal and increased amount of iron in in cells of free cataxia patients there is also other reasons but it&amp;#39;s it will be too long and i would like now to focus on on this part of the result because we have now a molecule that could modify this abnormal this decreased parameterization and this molecule is called arthesinate it&amp;#39;s an amity&amp;#39;s army artemisinin derivative which is known for very long time as an anti-malarial drug so it has been used for very long time in a lot of of of countries and very interesting for us in the case of ataxia this molecule can cross the blood-brain barrier and it has been shown that artesianate induce parmetration of transurine receptor and will then result in iron overload this has been shown in cancer cells and we use it in fibroblasts of patients with physical ataxia and what we observed is that when we incubate when we grow the cells of control and patients with arthritis here you can see the the black box that correspond to the amount of iron in patient cells grown with artesian it meaning that the artesian aid the reduce has a very strong effect and reduce the iron content in patient cells it&amp;#39;s still a little bit more than in control cells but it has very importantly decreased so based on these results we have decided to uh set up a clinical trial that we called artemis because of the name of artesianism and uh we we will very soon start this this clinical trial we have it has been delayed for months and months because of administrative problems and this is a phase one two clinical trial meaning that it is a study aiming to determine the tolerance and the efficacy of this molecule by this clinical trial we aim to identify the effective dose of artesynate able to reduce iron and we will measure the iron in blood cells in the patients and the second point is to identify the maximal tolerated dose of arthritis unit so it will consist in those escalation study with one tablet of 25 milli milligram per day and that will probably progressively increase until we found an effect a decrease of the iron in bmc so i this is very promising and and i hope that we will have success with this clinical trial but i have also to tell you that as i said it before there is a lot of consequences of a toxin deficiency and artisanate will act on the palmitoylation only this is already very important because it will probably modify the iron uptake from a transparent receptor also from the ntb transporters but also on other functions some of them being involved in the physiopathology of friendcataxia however there is a lot of consequences of cataxin defect that are a respiratory chain defect the the energy production a deficiency of different enzymes inside the mitochondria outside the mitochondria especially the hymn synthesis the some dna some some enzymes and protein involved in dna replication and repair and i don&amp;#39;t say that artesianate will cure completely different ataxia but it will help to to limit the iron uptake that could be detrimental for for the patients and i hope that we will have relatively soon in the six following months uh good news from this clinical trial and before finishing i would like to thank the people who were involved in this work especially florian petty who was a very brilliant phd student and arnold munich who will perform the clinical trial and i thank you for your attention thank you very much dr the questions will be at the end the next speaker in the program is dr sequi stefanie but she will join us after the end of the first session due to the time difference she will join us virtually from san diego and our final speaker for the session now is dr mendish george associate professor of pathology and cell biology columbia university dr mendes good morning everyone and i hope you hear me well um thanks very much first of all to mr karateas for the kind of invitation to share with you in the next 12 to 15 minutes something that we have learned from a different disease not produce ataxia but spinal muscular atrophy and why spinal muscular atrophy i hope that you will see in a moment the common interest common mechanisms between the two diseases so a little bit um some of the natural history for uh spinal muscular atrophy or sma patients there are mainly five types as you will see here i hope that you will see my pointer um from type zero to type four the large majority of the patients are the sma type 1 more than 50 percent of them here in this axis is the age this is mostly a juvenile type of the disease affecting mostly babies in the most severe types which is the type zero and the type one this is a fatal disease and patients suffering from sma of this kind and of these types succumbed to the disease within a year or two after birth sma type 2 is the more moderate type of the disease and sma 3 and even sma type 4 these are the milder forms of the disease with nuclear nearly normal lifespan but with severe motor disabilities so a little bit about the disease one of the common things together with fragisotractor is that this is all about a single protein the smn protein smn standing for survival of motor neuron in humans there are two genes as shown here responsible for the production of the smn protein the gene smn1 and smn2 you do need both genes because deletional mutations of both genes uh results in embryonic lethality so the disease is causing due to the deletion or the mutation of the smn1 gene the smn2 gene is a similar type of gene but unfortunately produces much less food length or proper protein compared to the smn1 so the disease is due to the severe reduction of the full-length protein produced by the smn2g now how do we study the disease so one of the important things in pre-clinical trials to first understand the molecular cellular neuronal circuit mechanisms as well as design potential therapeutics we need to use an animal model and in sma we have used the mouse model however the mouse doesn&amp;#39;t have two genes as the humans do the mouse has a single endogenous smn gene that produces smn and of course similar to humans if you deleted the smn and don&amp;#39;t do the gene you have an embryonic lethality so how people decide to do to recapitulate and have an animal model of the disease they have knocked down the endogenous cement and they have taken two copies of the human smn2 and humanized this into the mouse genome by having the two copies the results of this again is the deficiency of the smn protein now this cartoon shows a typical type 1 phenotype of the clinical symptoms prior to the identification of the genetic cause of the disease it used to be called the floppy infant syndrome because the baby didn&amp;#39;t have any reflexes similar to this type one is the so called delta seven mouse model and you can see here an affected mouse on its side is alive but it has very little posture and very little reflex compared to the normal littermate these mice survive approximately two weeks after birth whereas type ones are similar they succumb to the disease a year or so after birth what are the hallmarks of the disease first of all the death of spinal mute neurons in selective spinal segments muscle atrophy and impairment of spinal reflexes and postural defects again these are similar characteristics to what we&amp;#39;re seeing in frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia as mirella has alluded previously um we would have liked to see the point that really is key to the pathophysiology of the disease just to summarize many years of work from my lab here at colombia and as well as from others all over the world this is a transverse section of the spinal cord in blue is a spinal motor neuron sending its axon through the periphery making synapses with skeletal muscle in order to activate it but the muscle in itself knowing where our muscles are in time and in space this information is provided by this green cell which is a sensory neuron known as the represented neuron which goes and makes direct synaptic contacts with motor neurons so over many years of research now what we have found and the main findings of the disease is first of all that you having loss of these particularly synapses motor neurons effectively dysfunction selective uh motor neuron death and denervation all these leading to muscle paralysis and if the muscles are affected are reaching the lungs then you&amp;#39;re having respiratory distress and ultimately death of the patient as well as animal models so these things particularly now with the proprioceptive neurons raising the possibility that there might be common mechanisms between sma and frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia and particularly i would like to point out the following scenario what we have shown is that here is a spinal motor neuron that&amp;#39;s the soma which resides within the spinal cord this is the action in the peripheral nerve and here is the muscle how do motor neurons work well the moto neurone has been activated by pre-motor neurons showing here these different green synapses which are opposed to a certain type of potassium channel which is the kv 2.1 or also known as the delayed rectifier when your these synapses are activated they depolarize or activate the moto neuron the motor neuron actually and finally subsequently fires action potentials which these action potentials transmitted to the muscle in order to produce a fuse contraction and muscle movement ultimately joint movement in the context of the disease and certainly spinal muscular atrophy what is really happening is that you&amp;#39;re having fewer promoter synapses particularly from proprioceptive neurons which are glutamatergic and therefore they&amp;#39;re having less ability to activate the motor neurons subsequently to the reduction and dysfunction of those synapses you&amp;#39;re having fewer delayed potassium rectifier channels leading to a reduction in the firing ability and frequency of motor neurons and instead of the normal muscle movements you&amp;#39;re having twitches effectively resulting in an ability to move so because of the essence and the critical role proprioceptive sensory synapses play on the postsynaptic motor neural function then this raise the possibility that perhaps what is happening in sma might be relevant to phrygia&amp;#39;s ataxia as well so a little bit about the current therapies since the gene was developed back in 1995 from judith milken&amp;#39;s lab in france there has been an enormous effort at the basic medical research level as well as the clinical level and back in 2016 the fda approved the very first therapy this is called spin rasa and it&amp;#39;s based on the antisense oligonucleotide approach this is administered in trafficking and is supposed to be a drug that sorts out the splicing defect in the smn 2g so this can be applied to all sma type patients and of course it does not depend upon the number of copies of the smn2 which is really the moderator of the disease there is no limitation and of course um this has to be applied for a lifetime and i will tell you in a moment uh how the second fda approved is the gene therapy as mirella and dr yanaki has alluded this is based on a viral approach using the adeno-associated viruses or avs this administered in traffic intravenously and of course this applies to all sma types and this is a one-off treatment you have in one shot and that is it the third and most recently approved is a small molecular approach we have which has been developed by ptc in collaboration with ross and the sma foundation here in new york this is basically a pill you take one pill once a day for the rest of your life it could be applied to all sma patients older than two months old for a lifetime now um a little bit about the cost and the limitations and the differences of the three therapies spinraza or here the antisense oligonucleotides cost for the first time 750 000 during the first year and three hundred fifty thousand dollars per year thereafter for life and this being administered intra thickly which means that the patient has to be admitted into the hospital and injected into the cerebral spinal fluid what are the limitations well first of all the smn increase depends on how many smn ii copy numbers each patient exists it has to be administered within the cns meaning that perhaps in the periphery that might not be so accessible you need to have it every three to four months for the entire life and of course there is pretty high cost considering the zolgisma again is the gene therapy and currently as most of you know is the most expensive therapy for any disease in the world one shot 2.1 million however there are limitations with that first of all it cannot be applied to all sma patients which have having a much higher antibody than 15 milligram per meal it&amp;#39;s restricted to the age so it cannot be given to any patients because of issues with the blood-brain barrier much more important and this is the major difference between the other two therapies with the viral mediated therapy you have really no control of how much you&amp;#39;re overexpressing as a vet the cause of the disease the main issues with that protein so it continues since the the viral will transfect virtually every single neuron that it can be applied to the smn is going to continuously be over expressing over time and in collaboration with uh dr pelitzoni another colleague of mine here at colombia we have recently published and we have cautioned the community that when they&amp;#39;re using an aav particularly with an uncontrollable over expression of that protein it might have severe toxicity as we could have seen it in the mouse model whether it will apply in humans remains to be seen and we hope that we are wrong but of course this has to be taken into serious considerations particularly for neurologists when they are considering offering advice to prospective patients another limitations that three injections is not possible because as soon as you inject the av you will start the patient is going to start building antibodies and then of course there is always a problem of liver toxicity and potential side effects the small molecule approach currently being marketed by rush as abrasi it&amp;#39;s much cheaper compared to the other approach but still quite expensive depending upon the weight and the frequency in the country so this is uh in the u.s approximately a hundred thousand dollars to three hundred dollars a year once a day appeal um there are also limitations with this approach that is currently you&amp;#39;re not allowed at least from the fda point of view to be administered in neonates um it also may target other transcripts and that suggests that you might have potential of target effects and of course the cost which is also needs to be taken into account still is considered to be very high so just to summarize what i&amp;#39;m hoping friday&amp;#39;s ataxia community is going to learn from what we have found in spinal muscular atrophy research and therapeutics is that this was extremely fast considering from the moment that we have developed we have discovered the cause of the disease in spinal muscular atrophy back in 1995 in 2016 just over 20 years this has been a tremendous success in identifying the mechanisms and also bringing therapy into the patients however this could not have been done without the production and intense research efforts based on animal models cellular models not only mice but also other animal models that this was key but the mouse model particularly is terribly important as a pre-clinical model in order to go for an fda approval and then of course non-human primates will be used for toxicity but without proof of concept and proof of principle that we can rescue the mouse from the disease that would not have been possible and this came together with basic uh and clinical personnel so when the smn level is reduced to 20 percent the sma is also considered to be a multi-organ disorder so it does not really only affect the central nervous system although the central nervous system is the major issue you also have other issues with heart liver lungs and so forth and so on so the level of the smn protein is key to the extent that other organs are affected however the neuronal circuits between the motor neurons and the sensory neurons are key to understanding motor disorders and motor control there is also a clear and limited therapeutic window because it has been very well established right now that the smn is very much needed during embryonic development in early postnatal periods smn is not much so much needed in adults so as soon as and it&amp;#39;s an imperative to diagnose the situation pretty fast in order to intervene as fast as possible and its current the current uh thinking uh in therapeutic is that the earlier you intervene the better the outcome above all and i want to finish with a positive hopeful message that although sma is not cured there are three currently three powerful therapies that help first alleviating and helping from death of a patient something that would have been impossible 20 years ago and right now we might not be fixing everything but we&amp;#39;re certainly getting closer and closer and on that note i would like to thank you and of course should time be i will be more than happy to discuss any questions thank you dr mendes so uh i think we have some time for questions okay so uh is there any question from the flow yes please hello i&amp;#39;m still versus my passion of the faith electrons so my question is that we were discussing about the possible treatments and technologies that are advancing how close are commercialization let&amp;#39;s say to be available to patients for all this kind of stuff okay i think the question is from from an nfa patient all these advanced technologies how close could be to commercialization and i don&amp;#39;t know who would like to to have a an answer maybe doctor are all day [Music] online now uh i would take this question to the next panel where actually we are discussing about the pipeline update so i would suggest to to take it as a note and move it forward to the next panel another question is so first of all i would like to thank all the speakers for the wonderful presentations and talks and especially those that came from abroad either through zoom or in person that&amp;#39;s uh we&amp;#39;re greatly honored um i have a question for um uh dr agnes uh i think i really love your presentation congratulations for the very inspiring work that you&amp;#39;ve been doing have you um do you have any insights maybe on that palmitoylation defect that you see on the transferring molecules whether that is a consequence for example of a metabolic switch or perhaps a defect in gene regulation maybe some uh palmitalation transferases are not expressed as high i think actually we are able to to understand why there is effective motivation it&amp;#39;s relatively simple when you have found the solution but it was very difficult to demonstrate it actually the fataxin defect results in iron sulfur cluster containing proteins one of them is lipoic acid synthase that make the lipoic acid that is involved in the privately heterogeneous activity and when there is no lipoic acid synthesis and no lipoic acid there is decreased pdh activity decreased acetyl-coa synthesis and decreased palmitoil coe which need the acetyl-coa for for some disease so there is a direct relationship between trypoxin defect and parameterization that&amp;#39;s wonderful and is the drug that you&amp;#39;re targeting the defect also affecting that uh cycle that actually we don&amp;#39;t know how the artisan it acts what we precisely what that what we know is that it increased the parliamentariation of transferring receptor also on other iron transporter and probably also proteins that we didn&amp;#39;t have look at for the moment thank you could i address the question to mirella also is she online yes yes thank you she&amp;#39;s online hi i&amp;#39;m not sure if you&amp;#39;re you can hear me this is cosas from [Music] thessaloniki aristotle university thank you also very much for the wonderful presentation for sharing such inspiring and exciting data with us here today my question um is concerning the development of these novel vectors that you&amp;#39;re trying to target i guess different tissues with this so how do you envision this in the future do you think that it&amp;#39;s going to end up as a combination therapy using multiple vectors or are you trying to find a single vector that targets the disease tissues well at the same time protects or does not enter liver for example or other tissues thank you yeah thank you um for the question and the compliments um we don&amp;#39;t know we we&amp;#39;re throwing everything at it um it i imagine exactly like with the other speakers i think treatments for most diseases is a multi-pronged approach and i think it will require you know various approaches for different tissues that you&amp;#39;re targeting and even if it&amp;#39;s a gene delivery it won&amp;#39;t be just gene delivery i&amp;#39;m sure that you&amp;#39;ll have to add you know other therapies in combination with that i i would be surprised if it&amp;#39;s the one aav that can you know the magic aav that can um infect all the relevant tissues and not liver um so i guess it&amp;#39;s just this is the you know like um i guess the next session and the clinicians would be better to answer this but it would be depend on what is the most um prominent tissue that needs to be targeted for this individual and is it the cardiac you know is it regions of the brain and how we approach that and um and again with aavs i mean it was brought up with um the with um george&amp;#39;s talk about sma um toxicities is one big thing and with gene therapy you just have one shot that&amp;#39;s the the high risk with gene therapy um in particularly when it&amp;#39;s you know in entering into cells and um that&amp;#39;s why it has to be much more carefully thought out um in that way so i didn&amp;#39;t directly answer your question but i guess the bottom line is no we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re just seeing what aav targets the cardiac and maybe probably another aev that targets preferentially you know the cerebellar and so forth and we&amp;#39;ll just wait and see thank you okay we thank you mariella i actually have um on the same issue question so um you didn&amp;#39;t show us what the promoter of this iav vector is can you elaborate a bit i mean that cardiac specific or brain or either or both yes so one for the screen at the moment it&amp;#39;s just a standard we&amp;#39;re just using a green fluorescent gfp for the screen so it&amp;#39;s just um a cmv and we in our work we use a lot of the human elongation factor promoter so it&amp;#39;s just a generic promoter once we choose the candidate aavs we are going to address the promoter and the approach we would like to take is to look at the frataxin endogenous promoter so we&amp;#39;ve had conversations with um our collaborator and colleague in us dr marek naparella he&amp;#39;s published work in looking at different regions of the fratex and promoter to see what is the minimal promoter region to give rise to fratex and expression and um and i&amp;#39;ve just put in a grant earlier this year to look at that with to the australian government um to screen the three or four different promoters um because a lot of it will be about you know obviously regulating protection levels and you don&amp;#39;t want it too high you may be just a minimal promoter would be sufficient to avoid toxicity due to frataxin obviously there&amp;#39;s also maybe toxicity due to the aav itself but at least at the protection so we&amp;#39;ve had these conversations with um the check you ideally you want of a highly efficient aav and then play with the promoter you know so you want minimal you know transfection minimal dose to to because it&amp;#39;s so efficient that&amp;#39;s the approach we&amp;#39;re taking thank you thank you and uh another one uh what do you think i mean what are the advantages of using nanoparticles delivery tools instead of um i the main message i wanted to give is that again it comes down to flexibility because again like we heard in the sma you know talking maybe you know it&amp;#39;s about delivering protection protein or for attacks and mrna or a compound like that small molecule but that compound you can&amp;#39;t just give the small molecule it&amp;#39;d be degraded so it needs a encapsulated inappropriate delivery system to enter into the appropriate tissue and nanoparticles just gives you such um you know the vast materials the engineering you&amp;#39;ve got a lot more flexibility to work with so aavs you know work well in certain ways but they are limited even with the dna you know at the moment you can only deliver dna and a certain size whereas in other particles you&amp;#39;ve got a lot more open but with that obviously it takes a lot more work to screen so once you find this works you&amp;#39;ve got to find the appropriate delivery system to deliver that so definitely nanoparticles needs to be on the table as a delivery system for fa in parallel with with everything else that&amp;#39;s you know from you know our perspective thank you okay so i think uh that it is uh time to to close for uh for uh an hour let me let me thank the whole panel it was really forward looking and thank you uh dr yanaki thank you dr virella de tori from australia thank you uh anesthotic madame and george mendes thank you all it was really inspiring for our patients to see that the research is ongoing and we are looking forward for the next session that starts in an hour with an update on the pipeline so without further ado lance is served so please feel free thank you so much session right now which actually involves what we are more or less expecting the pipeline update on friedrichs ataxia and where we are heading i mean the science is great we are very fortunate to have all these scientists on board with us but uh we need also to understand the pipeline and where this uh it stands at the moment with okay we are okay and without further ado let me introduce miriam rai dr derice is the director of global relations and initiatives at the friedrichs ataxia research alliance which is the u.s patient advocate organization leading globally the world effort for fighting fa and finding a a an effective treatment and ultimately a cure medium the floor is yours and you will introduce to the next of the to the rest of the session thank you so good afternoon everyone [Music] well i will reiterate what all the others have done thanking the association vasilis but also all the other members of his team who are not on this place of the stage today but who did a very great job and i can tell you how complicated it is nowadays to organize a meeting partially in person it has been really challenging and don&amp;#39;t forget the challenge allowing all the different time zones of the interview so thanks to the association and rather than introducing the pipeline which gen pharma microleague will do i would like to start the pipeline on fa clinical research okay because my message is mostly meant to you here as fa community and yeah i will wait this is why yeah no problem yeah thank you so i would like to say thank you to the fa community thank you for all of you present here affairs parents caregivers researchers thank you to the fa community for your support to fa research you are supporting the research weather by helping fundraising and we heard this morning how hefa has supported the genetic lab at agent hospital to keep the adequate equipment needed for the diagnosis of fredericks ataxia whether by raising awareness and don&amp;#39;t forget may is the month of friday cataxia awareness so thank you for raising awareness like this event thank you mainly for participating to research studies and i&amp;#39;m saying clinical studies because i know unfortunately not many clinical trials are happening for fa in this regions and i can tell you there is a global effort to change the situation and we are work looking forward sorry to seeing cling trials happening here but thank you for participating to the clinical studies and i would like to insist on how important is the natural history studies on fa like the effect center here in athens this is providing a structure and a very valuable registry to better understand frida karaxia to build and be ready for better clinical trials thank you also for those who are registered at the frida kataxia patient global registry soon it will be available in many languages including greek and data collecting from their help also to build better clinical trials so again thank you for being an active member to the fa research we have achieved together and that&amp;#39;s your efforts some milestones and some important milestones to the journey on the development of treatment for fa the timing is now very exciting we have a lot of things getting ready being developed we will have today an outline an overview of the fa pipeline that would be introduced by fera and then we will hear another perspective an industry partner perspective of a specific repetitive approach and at the end we will have the clinician perspective on treatments under development but also how all these will be integrated into clinical practice so without having extra delay i would like to introduce my colleague jen farmer jen is the chief executive officer of pharah that&amp;#39;s the free track research friedrich attacks a research alliance in the u.s jen has many many long years in fa she&amp;#39;s very close to the fa community jen has a major as a genetic consultant so she knows very well the disease and i&amp;#39;ve been into fa field since 21 years and jen was already there so you can really trust what you will be telling you today jen the floor is yours thank you thank you so much miriam um for the introduction and um would just like to join you in thanking all of the organizers of this conference for putting together you know really a really spectacular agenda i&amp;#39;ve been able to listen in for the past few hours to a lot of the research talks that you&amp;#39;ve heard and really appreciate being able being able to join the conference today so thank you all so much let&amp;#39;s see hopefully you can see my slides and let me adjust there we go so um before i get started on the treatment pipeline i thought it might be helpful to some of you for me to tell you a little bit more about the friedreich&amp;#39;s taxia research alliance and what we do because we we really hope that we&amp;#39;ll be able to work more closely with ahepha and in your community both on the research as well as um you know basic research as well as the clinical research that miriam was talking about the natural history studies and bringing more clinical trials um to greece in the future and so um the friedrichs atexia research alliance was founded in 1998 by patient families affected by fa as well as researchers and the focus of the alliance is really to advance the research uh to find treatments and a cure we believe that um the way to do that is by raising funds and bringing people together who can both do the research as well as support the research and so a lot of what our organization does is is very research focused um and we we try and do this in in several different ways and these are the strategic pillars that you see here so we assemble conferences like this one to bring people together to share information to make sure that there&amp;#39;s an opportunity for you know education as well as knowledge sharing we don&amp;#39;t want research to be in a silo and we know that it&amp;#39;s important for researchers to also engage with patient community in the clinical community and and that&amp;#39;s what these kinds of conferences are so important for doing we also um you know spend a lot of time with all of our partners trying to build collaborations we know that you know one of i think when you saw dr dettori earlier today talk about her research um it was really impressive the number of researchers both in australia and outside of australia that she&amp;#39;s collaborating with um to you know to do her research and those kinds of collaborations we believe are really important we also know it&amp;#39;s important that we build collaborations with regulatory agencies like the european medicine association and you know collaborations between our organizations and you know that&amp;#39;s one of the important roles that miriam um is fulfilling it for pharah throughout the throughout europe and so you know we really believe in partnership and collaboration the other um aspects of what fair does is we directly fund fa research and we fund faa research around the world we do that through research grants to identify specific you know to to answer specific questions to understand fa better whether that&amp;#39;s the cells in the dish or studies in people like natural history studies we also believe that it&amp;#39;s important to create resources for the community so that we can speed up the research process you know i think one thing that we hear from patient families all the time is that the research goes so slowly and so one thing that&amp;#39;s really important to our organization is identifying ways to make the research go faster and one way to do that is to create resources that are available to the whole research community so that we reduce the time it takes to do that research so a lot of the cell models or cell lines that that are needed to do research we&amp;#39;ve you know put in place repositories where where cells can be shared um amongst researchers animal models um are in places where you know all researchers can access them we&amp;#39;ve also put in place resources like the patient registry that helps everyone kind of understand where individuals with fa are in the world and allows us to recruit clinical trials more quickly so these patient registries are incredibly important because they they identify where you know where people with fa are globally but then allow us to communicate directly with with the community as well as recruit for clinical trials and as miriam was saying the natural history studies are incredibly important we&amp;#39;re not able to do clinical trials if we don&amp;#39;t understand the disease in terms of the clinical symptoms how they progress and have ways to quantify or measure that progression over time you know we need tools called outcome measures and biomarkers that can be used in clinical trials to to measure how the disease changes over time and your participation in these kinds of studies is critical for us to be able to do those trials and so far has invested a lot over the last 20 years in natural history studies biomarker studies to help facilitate getting getting clinical trials going and improving um our ability to do those trials reliably and and efficiently so that&amp;#39;s just a little bit about farah and what we do i&amp;#39;ll switch gears now and just talk about the treatment pipeline before i i jump right into the treatment pipeline i just want to say a few things about how we think about developing therapies for fa when we think about developing therapies for fa there are multiple different ways to approach treatment and we believe that this is incredibly important we can target the frataxin gene we can think about targeting the frataxin protein the mitochondria where fratoxin serves its function and we can also think about symptoms that affect individuals with fa and can we treat the individual symptoms that are occurring so when when we try and think about identifying these treatments i like to think of this as sort of a cascade but a lot of the research that we&amp;#39;ve been doing for the past 20 years is to identify not only treatment approaches but what we call targets so very specific genetic or molecular targets that um you know we can make drugs from that will ultimately you know reverse some abnormal biology or some you know an or abnormal cell process and ultimately lead to improvement in symptoms and so the kinds of questions that we ask will inform identifying these these targets and so if we start up here with the fa gene and the the mutation that&amp;#39;s occurring in fa which is the the triplet repeat expansion we ask questions like you know how does the expansion occur and how does the the length of that gaa repeat expansion impact the phenotype or the symptoms and the progression of the disease and so it are there treatment approaches that can target this gaa expansion itself and will that be meaningful to treating the disease we know that the gaa repeat expansion silences um the transcription of the gene and you know reduces the amount of frataxin protein that gets made so a lot of research has gone into trying to understand how the repeat expansion silences the gene and can there are there genetic or small molecule targets that we can identify that will reverse this silencing then you know kind of going to the next level down if we think about the fratoxin the function of frataxon in the cell is that something can be that can be substituted by another protein or another drug for toxin functions in the mitochondria and so a lot of work has also gone into understanding what frataxin does in the mitochondria and the consequences of fratoxin being lost and so you know the oxidative stress or mitochondrial dysfunction are those um things that can be intervened upon can we borrow therapies you know that are being developed even in in other diseases that can reduce oxidative stress or improve mitochondrial function then um trying to understand how all of these consequences you know play out in the cell or in the um organ tissues and so you know how do these abnormal processes lead to cell death why are some types of cells more vulnerable than others and then how these changes play out over time in terms of you know changes that might happen very early in development as well as the progressive changes that take place over time and then um finally you know really trying to understand how this all translates to the symptoms that people have with fa and which of those symptoms are most important for for developing therapies and so this just should hopefully help you understand how we think about trying to develop treatments for fa and sort of the the basis for this treatment pipeline and you know with all the work that&amp;#39;s been done over the last 20 years the good news is that we&amp;#39;ve learned a lot and there are now lots of different ways in which we&amp;#39;ve identified where we might be able to intervene in the abnormal you know processes that are going on from the mutation all the way down to you know the tissue dysfunction or the the organ tissue impact in the disease so for example when we think about the repeat expansion there&amp;#39;s work now going on to try and cut out the repeat expansion or or edit the mutation we understand a little bit more about the silencing of the gene and specific drugs there&amp;#39;s a class of them now entering clinical trials called synthetic transcription elongation factors or syntax and these syntax um directly interact with the fa gene and reverse the silencing to allow more frags and protein to be made there are also now therapies entering the clinic that are both trying to replace the abnormal fa gene as well as the abnormal protein there are many drugs now that have been identified that can improve mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative stress and you&amp;#39;ll hear a little bit more about those today as well as you know looking at trying to protect the cell from those uh consequences and symptomatic therapies that you also heard about today with things like trying to regulate iron or even exercise as a therapy to improve symptoms of fa and so when we take all of this and try and put it into one picture and try and put it into a picture that tells you where where in the process are different treatments for fa we we this is what we call the treatment pipeline and so across the top is sort of the stage of development and starting on the left this is when things are very early um so in what we call discovery phase and so that&amp;#39;s being tested in the lab in cells typically in the dish or sometimes in animal models when when particular treatment approaches kind of move from the discovery phase and we say yes we think this is a potential treatment it moves into what&amp;#39;s called pre-clinical development and pre-clinical development is where you do a lot of testing in terms of dose and safety of the therapy to understand how you can test how you will test the therapy in in humans and people um there are regulatory steps that occur along the way that um are necessary where um new drugs get approved um i apologize that i&amp;#39;m using um us language in this pipeline slide but you know both in the u.s and in the eu new drugs have to be reviewed before regulatory authorities the fda in the u.s or the ema in europe before they can enter human clinical trials and so these are these are important steps that occur in the process of developing drugs and then human clinical studies occur and they occur in different phases we typically start with safety studies and then move on to what we call efficacy studies to understand how the drug is working and improving you know and if the drug is improving a specific symptom in the disease and then if we see that the drug is both safe and having a positive benefit it again goes through a regulatory review process before it can be ultimately available to to patients diagnosed with the disease so that you know doctors can write a prescription and give you a medicine and so this you know here we&amp;#39;re just kind of trying to show you where in the process different treatments are so each of these bars is you know where the arrow ends is meant to tell you where in development the treatment is then going down uh the left hand side are those treatment approaches that we just talked about so going from and now we&amp;#39;re going in reverse order so i apologize for that but you know here starting at the gene therapies through the mitochondrial based therapies so the mitochondrial therapies are the ones that are the furthest along in development and the first bar here is a drug called omavloxalone that is being developed by a company called riata pharmaceuticals and this drug has gone through multiple clinical trials and there was a positive result from the most recent trial and so riata has submitted to the food and drug administration in the u.s for approval of omap as a treatment for fa and so this drug is sort of the furthest along in the process you&amp;#39;re going to hear from dr matt klein from ptc therapeutics about patiquinone vetiquinone is also in current clinical trials and it&amp;#39;s at the stage where it&amp;#39;s being tested for for efficacy to see um you know how the drug improves the neurologic symptoms nfa there are several other drugs that are currently in clinical trials that are targeting um reducing oxidative stress or improving mitochondrial function these are all very small studies typically about 10 to 20 people and kind of looking for a signal to see if if the drug is is having the effect that they think it should have and then if if these drugs have a positive signal in these small early stage studies they would then move forward to much larger you know multinational studies to really understand if the full the full picture of the treatment effect but these are um you know several different drugs that that all focus on mitochondrial function and trying to protect the mitochondria when when frataxin is deficient you heard earlier today about a drug trial that will soon start in france that is looking at iron regulation there are several drugs that are currently in developed that are looking at pathways that are abnormally regulated because frataxin is deficient and so one of those that recently completed a clinical trial in europe is lariglidozone and that drug is being developed by minorex they did a small phase two study and saw some positive signal and so hopefully we will see lara glidazone go into a bigger multinational study you know um either later this year or early next year there are um several drugs that are in development right now that are focused on the frataxin protein and one of them is called cti1601 and with cti1601 the frataxin protein itself is being delivered and there&amp;#39;s a special carrier molecule that is attached to the protein that allows the protein when it&amp;#39;s injected it&amp;#39;s given through what&amp;#39;s called a subcutaneous injection so kind of like insulin is delivered for diabetes uh the drug is injected into uh into the skin but it it then disseminates through throughout the body and the carrier molecule allows for toxins to get into the cell and into the mitochondria and this is being developed by larimar therapeutics they finished a first in human study last year and currently evaluating longer term safety with the drug before they continue to go into the next clinical trial there are several different treatment approaches that um are trying to increase the frataxin gene expression so you know reverse that silencing that i talked about earlier and the the synthetic transcription elongation factor drugs that i mentioned are also called gene tax and they are being developed by design therapeutics and these drugs have just entered the first clinical trial and so people are getting just you know a single dose of this drug to test its safety and to figure out what dose might work to increase frataxin so this um just started about a month ago there&amp;#39;s a clinical trial ongoing in australia right now to look at a high dose of a supplement called the resveratrol that they&amp;#39;ve been um investigating now for several years that can increase fratoxin levels in the cell and should have results of this study later in the year and then there&amp;#39;s a lot of activity in the gene therapy space both replacing the gene as well as trying to edit the gene and cut out those triplet repeats and so um most of this research is still ongoing in the lab so testing in the animal models to understand dose and safety and distribution but you can see just by the number of companies listed here the amount of activity that is ongoing in trying to develop gene therapy as you heard from several of the speakers earlier today gene therapy is challenging because we want to get the gene to many different cell types in the body and right now the viral vectors and the nanoparticles that are currently available don&amp;#39;t allow for the gene to be delivered to every single cell in the body and so a lot of these different programs have had to pick and choose kind of different approaches both what cells they&amp;#39;re going to target or organ tissues they&amp;#39;re going to target as well as how these therapies are going to be delivered one of the programs being advanced by lexio therapeutics announced earlier this year that they&amp;#39;ve gotten approval from the food and drug administration in the u.s to begin their first clinical trial and lexio&amp;#39;s gene therapy approach is to replace the frataxin gene using a viral vector called avrh10 and they&amp;#39;re specifically focused on trying to deliver the gene to the heart in fa to protect from the cardiac disease or heart failure and they will um they anticipate starting this first clinical trial later this year so um that kind of gives you an overview of uh the different treatment approaches that are currently in clinical trials or soon to come to clinical trials farah keeps this treatment pipeline updated on our website and so you can always visit the website for each of these things you can kind of click on any one of the bars and there&amp;#39;s a paragraph of information that tells you some background about the drug and where the drug is in its current stage of development and just to end um you know to tie together a lot of what you&amp;#39;ve heard today um you know we all know that um there is a high unmet need in the fa community there are no approved therapies today and so any treatment approach whether it is to treat symptoms or to you know stop change the disease progression are going to be meaningful we believe that um for fa we&amp;#39;re going to need multiple therapeutics um to get to a treatment and a cure and the exciting thing is that you know we currently have a lot of therapies in development in clinical trials um and there&amp;#39;s a lot to be um hopeful about for the future and one of those you know therapies is currently under review so we could have a first approved therapy you know by the end of the year there&amp;#39;s a lot of interest from the pharmaceutical industry and i think this is really important for you all to to know and to understand that we&amp;#39;re not doing this alone there are a lot of partners in this a lot of people helping develop to develop therapies for fa and um you know what what&amp;#39;s critical to making this all go is our global engagement and partnership and and that partnership across all of our stakeholders and so um i&amp;#39;ll stop there and thank you for the opportunity to participate today and happy to take questions i think later in the session thank you very much and just let&amp;#39;s see while the slides come up uh let me begin by giving a thank you to vasulius and the honor of being able to come and present at the first hellenic phlegic ataxia society meeting i&amp;#39;ve been involved in developing therapies for friedrich ataxia for over a decade and it has been clear to me since the first day i started that getting drugs for patients with friedrich ataxia is a team effort that requires a close collaboration between scientists patients families foundations patient associations companies regulatory authorities as jen pointed out in a previous talk there are so many people that have to work together to get this forward and i am grateful to have been part of this community in our efforts it&amp;#39;s like i&amp;#39;m still waiting for a slide i will start talking and the slides will come so as i am currently with ptc therapeutics we are a company based in something&amp;#39;s happening what&amp;#39;s up yes well no it&amp;#39;s a good extent okay start again thank you again for having me here it is a pleasure to be here uh let me begin by talking now about ptc we are a global biotech biotechnology company that&amp;#39;s focused on developing therapies for patients with rare diseases we were founded in 1998 with a very simple mission use innovative science to develop drugs for patients who need therapies that was our goal when we started in 1998 and that continues to be our goal today even with our growth and success over the past 20 years while we are headquartered in the united states we have offices in 20 countries around the world and have activities in over 50 countries and have over 1200 employees but as we have continued to grow we have continued to focus on this mission of developing therapies for patients that need it today we have a very broad portfolio targeting a number of different rare diseases we have approved therapies for diseases including duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy which we heard a little bit about earlier today and have programs in a number of different diseases using a number of different approaches today i&amp;#39;ll be talking about our programs in friedrich ataxia and i&amp;#39;m very proud to say that we have two different programs one using a something taken by mouth a small what we call a small molecule and the other a gene therapy approach which we have heard a lot about today i&amp;#39;ll focus first on our small molecule program which is with a drug called the tiquinone which is currently in development for friedrich ataxia as well as other mitochondrial disease disorders the tiquinone acts at a target in the cell that is called 15 lipoxygenase or easier to remember 15 lo by targeting 15 lo our drug vetiquinone seeks to regulate the inflammation and cell stress which is known to be very important in friedreich ataxia and a number of other diseases it targets a specific pathway that&amp;#39;s called ferrotosis which is a big word to basically explain inflammation cell injury and cell death which leads to the symptoms of friedrich ataxia it&amp;#39;s given by mouth either as a liquid or as a pill and as i mentioned it&amp;#39;s right now in clinical trials for food drug ataxia as well as seizures associated with mitochondrial disease to date over 500 patients around the world have been treated children as young as one month of age adults is up to 68 years old have been treated with the drug and we have learned a great deal about how the drug works the pathway that we&amp;#39;re targeting with patiquitone this 15lo pathway has recently been shown to be very very important in a number of brain diseases including common diseases like parkinson&amp;#39;s disease and alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease but also importantly in rare diseases including friedrich ataxia the way the drug works i&amp;#39;ll go through now first let me explain what goes on in the cell in diseases like future cataxia when there&amp;#39;s high levels of stress when there&amp;#39;s high levels of stress that enzyme 15lo gets turned on when that enzyme gets turned on it increases cell inflammation and cells stress and decreases cell survival and leads to cell death what particular does is it turns 15 ll off and by turning 15lo off it can decrease inflammation it can decrease cell stress improve cell uh cell health and cell viability so basically it&amp;#39;s acting at an enzyme that&amp;#39;s turned on by the disease and by trying to turn it turning the volume down or turning it off it can decrease the inflammation and stress in the cell so the rationale or the reason why we&amp;#39;re developing the typical one for freedom of ataxia has a very strong scientific foundation uh it also has a clinical foundation which i&amp;#39;ll talk about shortly but importantly this pathway has been shown to be very very important in a number of different models of friedrich ataxia in the laboratory and also by looking at blood samples from patients with free jerk ataxia as we heard uh earlier this morning from uh professor roti iron accumulation is very important in freedom ataxia there&amp;#39;s a lot of iron that leads to stress and cell injury and cell death and there&amp;#39;s evidence of the pathway regulated by 15lo being elevated in patients with physical ataxia so what does that mean it means that we we know we&amp;#39;re targeting an enzyme 15lo that you can see in patients is active in the disease there&amp;#39;s also evidence in models in the laboratory whether those be cells in the petri dish or different animal models of disease that again this pathway of inflammation and cell stress that&amp;#39;s regulated by the 15lo enzyme is active in friedrich ataxia we also know that in these same models in the lab particularly the cell models in the lab that when we apply the the typical in the drug we see that we turn the volume down of 15lo see inflammation go down see cell stress go down and see cells survive so when you put all of these different pieces of evidence together it tells us that we&amp;#39;re working on an enzyme that is important that could be very important in the disease and it really supports the idea that turning this enzyme&amp;#39;s activity down can be important to cells and potentially important in slowing the progression of freezing potaxia we have also had clinical experience with the tiquinone which supports its further development for patients with friedreich ataxia patients with freezer cataxia have been treated in some of our earliest clinical studies which were compassionate use studies where there were reports of improvements in patient symptoms and we have also done a previous clinical trial uh in patients with friedrich ataxia which also gave us encouraging results to continue to develop the drug i&amp;#39;ll also mention that this clinical experience also not only teaches us about the potential for a drug to be helpful in the disease but it also teaches us how to do clinical trials in a disease i think as we&amp;#39;ve talked a little bit about today and jen farmer emphasized in her talk drug development in friedrich ataxia is very changing one of the challenges we have is we don&amp;#39;t yet have an approved therapy so it is hard when you don&amp;#39;t have an approved therapy to know the path to go down to get another approved therapy and so we have all many companies and many researchers have spent a lot of time trying to understand how do we design these clinical trials that we need to take to ema and to fda to get drugs approved and there&amp;#39;s a lot we can learn by talking but this the only way to really learn is by doing and by conducting clinical studies and then making learnings and then being sure we apply those learnings to future clinical trials so as we uh move forward with the ticket on fridge of ataxia we are now in our phase three trial that we call move fa and this trial is building on the scientific rationale i talked about the clinical experience we have with the drug and other studies and also allows us to apply a lot of the lessons we have learned it that we have learned as well as other companies have learned in doing clinical trials in fuji of ataxia with the hopes that we give the child the highest chance of success this trial is currently ongoing it is being conducted around the world uh with sites in europe in australia new zealand uh united states and brazil and it&amp;#39;s basically what&amp;#39;s known as a placebo-controlled trial which means patients come in the trial and they will get either the drug particularly or placebo for a period of 72 weeks and that sounds like a long time and it is a long time but again this was one of our learnings that having a longer trial is really important in being able to show that a drug works in a disease like friedrich ataxia which takes many many years to progress our job in a clinical trial is in to take a small part of the lifetime of a person and be able to show a drug works and you can imagine if a drug if a disease is moving slowly that the longer you can see and test the drug the better your chance of seeing it can slow a disease and so that was one of our important learnings that we have in this trial after this placebo period all patients will receive the tiquinone for at least 24 more weeks so that means that for patients who enroll in the trial they will have the opportunity to receive the drug even if they go through a period of receiving placebo first in this trial we enrolled patients who are seven years of age and greater actually the majority of patients in this trial are between the ages of 7 and 18 years old this is something that we believe is important because if you have a drug that is going to try to slow disease progression it would make sense to try to start it as early as possible before the disease has progressed this was something we were able to do given the experience of the tiquinone in treating children with mitochondrial disease where we were able to demonstrate that we could give the drug to children in clinical trials the primary endpoint of the study is changes in the disease rating scale the modified physics of taxi rating scale and we&amp;#39;re also looking at activities of daily living as sort of a secondary a key secondary endpoint or another critical thing we&amp;#39;re going to measure in the disease in the trial to demonstrate that the drug is having an important effect on patients with frigid ataxia i mentioned that this study is fully enrolled and we expect to have the results of this trial in the springtime or what we say the second quarter of 2023. i&amp;#39;ll now shift gears to talk about our other program in future cataxia which is our gene therapy program and ptc has a platform of gene therapy programs that includes friedreich ataxia and other diseases we&amp;#39;ve taken an approach in our gene therapy programs to do something that we call targeted delivery you can give a gene therapy in many different ways many of the therapies being studied today are given intravenously that is that given like an as an injection and the gene therapy then has to travel to many parts of the body where it might work the approach we&amp;#39;re taking at ptc is something we call targeted delivery to the brain and what that means is that we administer the gene therapy directly to a part of the brain where we think it will be most effective we believe by doing that there&amp;#39;s many advantages first by delivering the gene therapy to the exact location where you think it will have the most important effect you&amp;#39;re certain that it&amp;#39;s getting there it&amp;#39;s not like you&amp;#39;re administering it to another part of the body and are hoping that enough of it reaches where it really needs to go this also allows us to give lower doses of the gene therapy again because we know we&amp;#39;re getting it to directly the spot in this case in the brain where it needs to go our first program using targeted gene therapy delivery is for a rare disease known as aadc deficiency aadc deficiency is a disease where children are born with uh out an ability to produce normal levels of a chemical in the brain called dopamine dopamine in the brain is very important for motor activity movement things like being able to raise your head sit up for a child to crawl eventually for a child to stand and to walk and children born with aedc deficiency often don&amp;#39;t have the ability to do these tasks and so what we&amp;#39;re doing with our gene therapy is giving a gene using a virus much of what was talked about earlier today and it&amp;#39;s given through a very special brain surgery procedure that is done now for other neurological diseases but in this case we&amp;#39;re using it to deliver the gene therapy to a specific part of the brain where dopamine is really needed and what we&amp;#39;ve been able to demonstrate is that by doing that delivering a gene that is functioning to part of the brain that needs it we see increased levels of dopamine and then improvement in motor function this program is is advanced now in the regulatory process in europe we hope to have a approval for this gene therapy in 2022 and we are taking the learnings from this program and are now moving into our gene therapy program for future cataxia the friedrich ataxia gene therapy program is not yet in the clinic we&amp;#39;re still doing important testing before we go into the clinic but this program also utilizes the idea of a targeted approach in the case of free trip ataxia we&amp;#39;re delivering the gene therapy to the cerebellum specifically the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum that&amp;#39;s a part of the brain we know that&amp;#39;s really really important in friedrich ataxia now while we understand that frederic ataxia is a whole brain disease those are the parts of the brains that are affected and we also know it&amp;#39;s a whole body disease many organs in the body are affected we are taking an approach though of delivering the gene to one part of the brain we know that is particularly important to a lot of the symptoms understanding of course that as jen farmer mentioned friedrich ataxia will be a disease where hopefully one day we&amp;#39;ll have many therapies and then it&amp;#39;s going to take many therapies to treat the disease because it&amp;#39;s so complicated well we have a drug in particular that gets to all parts of the body including the brain our approach is to say okay let&amp;#39;s take the gene therapy then and focus on one specific area of the brain and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing uh in our program as i mentioned we&amp;#39;ve uh we&amp;#39;re still not yet in the clinic but we&amp;#39;ve completed many important proof of concept animal studies showing that we can deliver the gene therapy we can show that when we deliver the gene therapy the new gene can make for toxin levels it can make for toxin levels that can vary by the amount of the gene that we give and we&amp;#39;re right now in the process of completing the remaining studies that will allow us to get into clinical studies in patients and as jen farmer mentioned as well these are studies that are typically done in in laboratory animals and what they help us understand is the exact dose that we should be giving to patients and it also makes sure that the gene therapy is safe to be used in patients so we look forward to continuing to advance that program and get it into the clinic as soon as possible i&amp;#39;ll mention that we&amp;#39;ve all we&amp;#39;ve been able to complete the manufacturing process for material that could be used in patients that&amp;#39;s also another very important step in gene therapy and we hope that once we&amp;#39;ve completed uh our not pre-clinical studies that we can then move ahead uh with clinical studies and we already talking about trying to do those clinical studies in different sites around the world so in summary pt therapeutics is proudly uh partnering and working in the fuji catastrophe community we&amp;#39;re dedicated to delivering therapies to patients affected by freedom ataxia and we&amp;#39;re excited to be able to have two different programs one targeting the whole body with particular the other with the gene therapy that&amp;#39;s targeting one particular area of the brain known to be very important to the disease our move fa trial with particular is fully enrolled we&amp;#39;re looking forward to being able to share those results from that trial uh in 2023 and we look forward to continuing to progress our gene therapy program forward with the hope of being in the clinic in the very near future so with that i&amp;#39;ll thank you all again for your attention and the honor of being able to be here thank you motherfuck&amp;#39;s excellence so let&amp;#39;s move ahead it&amp;#39;s a pleasure to introduce the next speaker professor massimo pondolfo he is currently professor at the department of neurology and neurosurgery at mcgill university in canada prior to that massimo has started his journey in medicine in italy and then he moved to the us and then to montreal canada and then he moved to brussels for over 20 years where i had the pleasure to work with him on fa and last year he moved back to montreal to continue working on fa because he didn&amp;#39;t want to stop before finding a treatment so massimo it&amp;#39;s for you [Music] calispera symposium and i really want to congratulate uh for setting up this association that is putting you know supporting a fa patient from greece and making them really part of the global fa community what i&amp;#39;m going to do today is let me share my screen [Music] which i hope you can see now um is to uh make a number of considerations about developing the development of treatments for ffa and particularly pointing out certain challenges um it&amp;#39;s not going to be as let&amp;#39;s say pessimistic talk on the contrary and i think my my uh first slide really uh shows you how i&amp;#39;m not pessimistic but but really i would like to point to the accent of a number of challenges that are still there and that are being uh progressively uh tackled by researchers throughout the world and we hope that we can get really beyond these obstacles to uh define effective disease modifying treatments for a fa i&amp;#39;m saying i&amp;#39;m not i&amp;#39;m not uh pessimistic on the contrary and just to give you an idea to put that things in context i&amp;#39;m showing you this slide that shows when i started that my research in a fade back in the 1980s uh we really didn&amp;#39;t know much about this disease uh we knew that it was the probably the most common inherited attacks at least in europe in people of european descent we knew that it was autosomal recessive but we had no idea of the genetic mutation we had no diagnostic test we had the clinical diagnostic criteria that then we realized later on that we&amp;#39;re missing a good part of the patients and of course we had some supportive therapy but essentially we didn&amp;#39;t know anything about the mechanism of the disease we didn&amp;#39;t know anything about the possible therapeutic targets we didn&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re there of course so we didn&amp;#39;t have any treatment they&amp;#39;re not only available but not even in sight and then things have changed radically i would say uh since that time and of course the main advance was the discovery of the genetic mutation underlying nfa which is as you all know the uh the expansion of the gaa triple repeat inside the gene according for the protein from taxing there are some individuals who have other types of mutation affecting the frataxin gene but so far all of them are what we call compounded heterozygous with the ga origin expansion which therefore is found in each and every fa patient in the world what does this mutation do and i borrowed the slides from my graduate student now uh becoming a phd kiara dionysi it causes a number of changes in the structure of dna and in the uh in the protein that binds this dna in the cell nucleus that lead to what we call epigenetic silence that is this gene is not working anymore uh is not making enough of the messenger rna and it&amp;#39;s not making enough of the protein it uncodes for that is frataxin so basically leads to uh reduce the level of frataxin uh frataxin transcript and protein uh which are the cause of the disease free track ataxia is a disease of reflexive deficiency this deficiency is not absolute there is there is a residual level of frataxin that is made and this is very important and we we realize we can see that some cells in the body can do pretty well with that residual level of frataxin others do not so there is what we call a specific vulnerability to this protest this partial frantoxin deficiency that defines the pathological and clinical features of the disease and how much uh fratoxin deficiency is important for uh for developing the disease and its end it is important can be clearly seen by the fact that you have some individuals as it is a young man in the in the video here was in his early 20s he&amp;#39;s on a wheelchair and as you can see severely a toxic and has very low levels of attacks and we have other individuals like the lady here that you can see with miriam who is in her 70s and as you can see is much less affected and the difference is basically in the level of frataxin that these patients have in their system now uh this leads us to the first uh you know obvious in in a way approach to try and treat fa if the is a disease of frataxin deficiency let&amp;#39;s see whether we can correct the destructive deficiency if we can bring the levels of frataxin to the to those of um normal individuals or at least to those of heterozygous carriers this is a recessive disease the parents are heterozygous for the causative mutation and they have maybe 50 60 of the level of frataxin of their affected children and they are fine so let&amp;#39;s see whether we can find ways of boosting the expression of attacks into that level and this slide shows you some some possible approaches of course the gene editing you heard about it acted directly on the grated expansion and get rid of it it&amp;#39;s still at an early stage of pre-clinical development there are a number of challenges in order to take this to clinical fruition but there are a number of uh of groups that are working on it the second possibility is to the use of epigenetic modulators so that is of uh different types of molecules that can act on that epigenetic silencing that i mentioned before there is those changes in dna structure and in the proteins that are binding the dna and the fratoxin gene that make it silent and by trying to change this kind of structure so to add at this level one can try and boost the expression of different taxing gene that is make it express make it uh put it in the situation of of making uh am rna and therefore protein uh as if the expansion was not there the expansion is still there but it&amp;#39;s made let&amp;#39;s say harmless by this kind of epigenetic modulators there have been approaches in the past to use molecules called the east on the acetylase inhibitors unfortunately they haven&amp;#39;t got too real uh to the clinical phase uh because of issues about the biodistribution and toxicity and but there is now a phase one study that just started by the company design therapeutics that it uses an epigenetic modulator essentially a specific molecule that would boost the transcription of the frataxin gene and therefore the expression of reduxing just started we will see what&amp;#39;s going to happen and then of course there are a number of other ways of acting on frataxin deficiency gene replacement therapy which is the classical gene tear and be introduced by some kind of a vector a copy of the dna uh of a dna fragment that encodes for frataxin which is an extra copy compared to those in the the chromosomes and they use it to make the fratoxin that is missing in the cells of fluorescent patients there are other other molecules that can induce frataxin transcription regardless of the presence of the expansion uh there is the protein replacement therapy what you heard from from jen farmer earlier about the the current studies by the company larimer that uses frataxin fused to another shorter peptide that allows it to be distributed in cells throughout the body and to get into mitochondria this is ongoing other inducers the fratoxin synthesis that is molecules that have boosted the ability of the fratoxin messenger rna to be translated into proteins and finally inhibitors of redux degradation that are also being studied by some groups all of this clearly has the goal of restoring normal frataxin level but let&amp;#39;s ask a couple of questions where do we need to restore for a taxi level and when do you need to restore frataxin levels to have a maximum efficacy and we needed to have a critical look at what we call the neuropathology of radiocataxia i will only speak about the nervous system today i am a neurologist but of course there are other parts of the body that are affected like the heart like it like the better cells in the pancreas that need to be considered but just to focus into the nervous system we realize that if we wanted to restore normal frotaxin levels we needed to do it in the cells that are primarily affected by ffa first and foremost and we have to do it in a time frame that allows these cells to survive because we fee we cannot treat a dead cell of course so let&amp;#39;s see briefly what are the main targets in the in the nervous system for uh for for frataxin replacement therapy so the first target is what we call the the the proprioceptive neurons in the dorsal root ganglia these are neurons that are found and not even inside the northern central nervous system but in kind of a small kind of swellings of of the nerve roots uh near the spinal cord uh this contains cells that are neuron there are nerve cells that send their uh their axons the the the fibers you know the thin nerve fibers that come from the nerve cells to uh structures essentially in in muscle and in other uh and intended that to feel the opposition and movements of body parts and then the other part of their action of their nerve fiber goes into the central nervous system and transmits this information to the brain and to the cerebellum that is necessary for a good movement coordination imbalance so basically these cells are key to provide that information about body part emotion and position that is essential for coordination and these are the first cells that suffer and eventually uh disappear in in in friedreich ataxia and actually the uh the atrophy of their central branch what we call which goes in the posterior column of the spinal cord that you can see here on the right is what gave the name of the original essay by professor friedrich which he was called the uber degenerative accredited strength which means only the generative atrophy of the posterior columns of the spinal cord and this really shows and this is found very early and one issue with this pathology which is basic pathology of the pha is the fact that it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to progress very much when we see the patients is already there and we have a neurophysiological data that we collected with a kind of a sophisticated technique which is called magnetoencephalography showing that there is a defect basically the transmission of the brain of this information of body motion and position and this defect actually depends on how severe the toxin deficiency is to begin with so basically to the length of the ga repeat expansion that doesn&amp;#39;t really change with time meaning that when a patient becomes asymptomatic is probably already established and we actually have developed uh you know uh now dr yonizi uh has developed in in our lab in vitro model in which she differentiated cells this kind of cells that is proprioceptive neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells that you have already heard about today and she noticed that this cells of course afro-toxin deficiency deficient the green and the orange and red lines uh show the expression of reduxing throughout the differentiation and development of the cells and you can see that these are lower than the levels so the other two blinds that are the controls but she also noticed that that uh these cells actually express less of the markers of the proprioceptive neurons like a parvalbumin and the one that i evidence now and the run x3 which is a transcription factor that is important for the development of proprioceptive neurons this just means that there is something wrong in this cell so already at the time when the nervous system develops so well before symptoms happen and she also noticed that there&amp;#39;s something wrong in the way that this this nerve fibers grow out of the cells that they are more tortuous they don&amp;#39;t get as far and she has done some quantitative analysis on this and even the electric properties of these cells these are neurons these are excitable cells that produce what we call like action potential electric signals well their ability to generate this electric signals is somewhat impaired in at least a subset of the cells showing that there is a clear developmental component we have to keep that in mind because targeting this type of cell so when when individuals have symptomatics they may already be too late and so we cannot expect a correct important correction of the phenotype but by ear treatment there are only targets of this kind of cells do we need to target them i think so because anyway there are there is some evidence that the development of stories now to the whole story and these are you know these are uh uh you know pathology samples from dr mccorpen in albany new york who has studied what happens over time to to this proprioceptive neurons and they keep being lost so they develop abnormally but they are also lost so they are a target but this target has to be seen in the context of something that may a bit contributed to the disease to the disease progression but whose defect has already been clearly established even before symptoms appear so this is clearly not not a sufficient target what we needed to target that we needed to target the cerebellum the cerebellum and particularly the deep structure in the cerebellum called the dentate nucleus then you can see in the upper image on the left that kind of ribbon of gray matter uh it&amp;#39;s a the main output pathway out of the cerebellum the cerebellum is a part of the brain it does certain types of computation that are necessary for coordination and balance and then it has to communicate the results of its computation if you witness it to the rest of the brain and it does it through the dentate nucleus now this output pathway is essentially lost if you look at the image below the one marked refe you wouldn&amp;#39;t even see the ribbon of you know of gray matter in the depth of the cerebellum it&amp;#39;s gone the cells are gone now this is again an early process but it&amp;#39;s not a a complete process when patients become symptomatic in fact we think that patients become symptomatic when this process starts when the uh dental nucleus has already dysfunction in such dysfunctional cells and probably as lost already a number of cells and the cerebellum cannot communicate with the rest of the of the brain and symptoms of ataxia become very evident at that time that&amp;#39;s when when people become symptomatic now that&amp;#39;s a valuable target because if we intervene early enough we can probably stop this the malfunctioning and the generation of the cells and save whatever is left and make it functional again so this is a valuable target this is the target of the gene therapy that has been developed by the company if you see the speaker just before me but you have to keep in mind that there is no time to lose uh this is just a small summary of a study done by magnetic pressure and imaging that shows how with time this structure keeps being atrophied because becomes becomes lost so uh if you intervene too late there is basically not much to do again here uh i think that you understand already from the previous example of the dorsal ganglion in this example that intervening early is a major issue if we want to preserve maximum functional capacity in patients with apha and probably with any kind of neurodegenerative disease so this structure is being lost over time and the data that we have from neuropathology showed that even a few years after symptom amounts that is already significantly atrophic and then there are other structures that become a traffic with time and particularly what we call the central motor pathway of the pyramidal tracks these are basically the nerve fibers that go from the from the cortex of the brain where the motor cortex is where we decide so the the part of the of the brain and that gives the uh the start to the voluntary movement when we want to make a movement it&amp;#39;s our cortex and that activation gives the order to the uh neurons in the spinal cord that control the muscle and it does it through a pathway which is called the pyramidal tract and this pathway also degenerates particularly the longest fibers that go to the neurons that control their legs this causes weakness this causes muscle spasms so this cause a number of symptoms that are mostly present in advanced faa and in fact we have neurophysiological evidence that the conduction through this pyramidal tract is impaired what we call the central motor conduction time for instance here from the brain to the muscles in the in the hand it gets you know 15 17 milliseconds from a normal average of nine a little more than nine milliseconds so you get this conduction slowed the potential is lower muscles become weak this this happens later on so we have the third phase in the third wave if you wish you know the drgs and then the cerebellum and then we have this wave of degeneration of the pyramidal tracks if we act only on the previous waves and even if we are fully successful and we don&amp;#39;t deal with this third wave we will nevertheless expect to have some pathology but they maybe have friedreich attacks and it becomes more what we look to what we call a hereditary paraplegia a condition in which legs have become weak and stiff uh but without much ataxia is still is still a function clearly causing causing function and impairment but it may be less bad than nfa so it may be just a partial treatment to treat for instance the cerebellum but i live at this part of the pathology progress and this clearly happens with time and because we know that the longer the disease the longer the center of conduction time so the more impaired this conduction in this pathway so basically if we can make a step back we can say that what we want to do with fratex restoring therapy ideal is to restore physiologic frataxin level in all cells lose function and survival are compromised by redux and deficiency but we have challenges as first of all is the limited or unbalanced the biodistribution of gene therapy vectors or other therapeutic agents they have to reach these targets at least in the nervous system the target i just mentioned and then they have to uh direct the frataxin expression to a correct level not to not too little because otherwise you know the the treatment fails to do what it&amp;#39;s supposed to do but also not too much we don&amp;#39;t want to have to and any it is this expression that has to be balanced we don&amp;#39;t want it to too much in some cells and too little in other cells and we need it to be sustained over time without too many changes up or down because it can become excessive or insufficient over time at least in some cell types so we needed to first of all to know what the current approaches the developing approaches can do in terms of reaching their targets in terms of how much frataxin they use and how long and how this behaves over time uh we know that current g therapy vectors and other therapeutic agents have limitation in reaching or relevant to therapeutic targets within and out of the cns and therefore we can and that&amp;#39;s why we think that waiting for the magic bullet that they can do all of this it may be worth starting to use to target only a subset of vulnerable cells can we cure a fake piecemeal maybe but of course we have to understand that the treatments that are now being used to uh to upregulate for attacks and are probably not uh be able to uh are not able to target the whole thing treating cardiomyopathy may give independent benefit there is a trial that will soon share start of gene therapy directed for that to what extent in what patients we need to know what can we expect by treating just the drg so the the of the dental nucleus as i said if you try to treat just the drgs probably we&amp;#39;re not gonna get much of of of of a benefit because these are already compromised at the developmental stage treating only the dental nucleus if you do it fast enough we can probably stop the progression of attacks and maybe get some some improvement in the ataxia component of the disease my payment may not probably prevent the later development of weakness and muscle stiffness what we call the uh so turn the disease maybe it&amp;#39;s some sort of  paraphrases what can be how much we can expect from neuroplasticity from vector diffusion we target the region the vector may diffuse to other brain regions and have a more widespread effect that we need early we need a pre-clinical studies in animal models to figure that out and of course there is the issue of administering a second the third treatment to target additional cells and tissues and i&amp;#39;m referring particularly uh to gene therapy and the limitation it has from the immune point of view is excessive frataxin expression problem how does it change over time i raise this question we know from animal and cell cultural data that may be a two three-fold higher expression than normal is not problematic but there are data that that tenfold or more high expression is toxic at least for some cell types this may be related to various mechanisms too much frataxin can actually clog the the important mechanism into mitochondria the processing mechanism that makes a mature frataxin and this may affect other this may affect other other proteins as well that needed to be proud to enter mitochondria and process those there may be protein aggregation and accumulation we see that the transfected cultural cells that over-express for attacks inhabiting the wrong part of the cells and maybe to match and deform aggregates and of course the iron sulfur synthesis may be impaired if there is too much of one component compared to the others and finally there are some there are some evidence there is some evidence that if you increase too much of a taxing expression you get you get the feedback inhibition of the endogenous frataxin that may be also involve the other rhino surface synthesis factor and this may be a mechanism actually of impaired functionality when you have too much frataxin we have to consider the immune response that can of course the first of all and even before you can treat the leads to the exclusion of patients with pre-existing antibodies to the virus from which a viral vector is derived there may be ways around this ways to immunosuppress these patients or better to to derive vectors that do not cross-react with naturally occurring viruses so that are non-viral based but this is all working progress so for the same reason with the current doctors today essentially one shot only treatment you cannot repeat and if you have treated one part of the body and then you need to treat the second part of the body that may be problematic there may be lots of efficacy over time if if if any immune response is mounted against the cells that have that have been infected by the virus and there may be acute toxicity issues systemic we know that high doses of certain viral vectors like aav can cause a systemic reaction with a systemic inflammatory reaction and dysfunction of important organs like the liver and you can have focal uh also you know toxicity related to immune response and this may actually target the dorsal root and the same cells that we try to save in in fa and there is a whole again current research to about this we know already from experience in gene therapy that preventive and therapeutic immunomodulatory treatments are needed and some some groups are developing approaches to uh that should in principle allow repeat dosing and therefore facilitate also this means that this new approach to treatment i mentioned before uh a few words about other approaches so you have heard about about equinox you have heard about the concerning of the heart about many other approaches that are being now in the pipe that are now in the pipeline from gen farmer basically these are targeting the downstream consequence of fratoxin deficiency this is related what frataxin does frataxin is involved in iron sulfur cluster biogenesis and if this is impaired you have alteration of its energy metabolism mitochondria respiratory chain and also energy metabolism the mitochondria you have uh you have oxidative stress decreased energy production etc and of course this may all be targets of retoxin deficiency and i will just and i will just say that there are a number of treatments of course and you have heard about that they are targeting this downstream consequence of frataxin deficiency these are important approaches first of all because they&amp;#39;re probably going to be going to be available before some of the taxing restoring treatments are really developed enough and secondly because they may be complementary being used together with those to assure that the best of a possible rest operation of function is achieved uh in in the in the shortest possible time range i just want to mention one final thing uh concerning these approaches to correct frataxin deficiency you have already heard that inflammation may they pay a road and we actually didn&amp;#39;t look at changes in the proteins that are present in the several cerebral spinal fluid the fluid that that&amp;#39;s the brain and the spinal cord and we looked at what shade if there are proteins that are present at different abundance in fa patients versus controls and we found the number but very interesting we found both upregulated and down regulated proteins that have to do with the immune system and with inflammation uh showing that inflammation is clearly a component of the neurodegenerative process of the fee and therefore that we needed to include you know molecules or approaches with anti-inflammatory properties if we really want to have a full spectrum of uh weapons against the consequences of retoxin deficiency how do we assess therapeutic efficacy that we require a long talk by by itself we needed to have clinical outcome measures and we needed to weather what we call biomarkers this is this is a long process that is basically uh based on the ongoing natural history studies and complementary studies and not time to get into this but i&amp;#39;m saying that this is absolutely essential to proper design of clinical trials and to get to fruition of this therapeutic developments in terms of in clinical trials appropriate outcome measure and particularly understand what is the clinically significant improvement if we give a treatment we want to see a change in the life of patients we don&amp;#39;t want to see the change in a biological parameter or in a ready scale that then is in the eye of the observer more than in the life of the observed so that&amp;#39;s uh with this kind of with this kind of uh of consideration i will stop here i&amp;#39;m afraid i&amp;#39;m even spoken a little too long and i&amp;#39;m ready to take west you know together with the other speakers thank you thank you massimo thank you to all the panelists i hope the participants um thanks to all the panelists have a better understanding how the work is being done towards the complicated multiple therapeutic approaches for free dynaxia i would like to ask if we have questions from the zoom chat do we have online questions before taking questions from from the room or we don&amp;#39;t have questions okay yes [Music] a better understanding on the developmental biology of of the of the disease why does it specifically affect this type of neurons and it doesn&amp;#39;t affect some other type of neuron or another cell type equally since it&amp;#39;s a gene that is ubiquitously expressed so the protein is so why does it selectively degenerate these particular tissues do we have a good understanding so far thank you uh should i answer okay the short answer is no we don&amp;#39;t have a good understanding uh we are trying to work on it because exactly this is this is a crucial part of the story why certain cells let&amp;#39;s say with 20 of a toxin which is probably what you know what&amp;#39;s in an average level in in fa patients why a lot of cells are fine with that and others are not and even cells of the same category neurons cells of the brain some cells of the brain are fine with low fraction and some cells of the brain or the nervous system are not we&amp;#39;re trying to figure it out and that&amp;#39;s why we are working on on cell with cellular and animal models and we try to dissect really what&amp;#39;s wrong and and we what we also need is to compare different cell types and look what&amp;#39;s uh what are the differences why for instance cortical neurons neurons of the brain cortex are essentially much more resistant with possible exceptions of those that are that control uh movement you know from the motor cortex they have long axons but long axons it is not the whole story because because uh other cells there is still a difference even between cells that are all that have long axons why we they may be related to specific factors that are important for the development and survival of certain cell types and that are somehow affected either directly by an impairment in iron sulfur plaster synthesis or indirectly by mitochondrial dysfunction or some other downstream a mechanism to be honest we don&amp;#39;t know we needed to do this work thank you can i ask one question to matthew also so matthew thanks also for the wonderful talking for sharing your your um tremendous work that you&amp;#39;ve been doing with the company my question is regarding that small molecule drug that you&amp;#39;re developing and it&amp;#39;s targeting unsaturated fatty acid oxidation if i understood well do you have any input on whether the effect of the drug might be different on neuronal cells versus heart cells for example heart muscle primarily relies on fatty acids for energy and the opposite i think if i&amp;#39;m not wrong might happen under stress on the neuron and a rural component so can you target i mean the drug specifically or is it going everywhere and it might have uh different types of effects thank you yeah very good question the the target of the drug is an enzyme in a pathway that&amp;#39;s present in all cells and has been shown to be a response pathway to oxidative stress in all cells which is rather than a specific approach we&amp;#39;re taking a more general approach to a pathway that could be important in every part of the body that&amp;#39;s affected by fa um may i ask so i would like to ask you what kind of vector do you use for the clinical trial is an aav and what&amp;#39;s stereotype it&amp;#39;s an aav we haven&amp;#39;t yet shared what the serotype is we&amp;#39;ll do that once we&amp;#39;re getting closer to going into the clinic okay and one more question actually to both of you um given the complexity of the regulation of gene regulation and the multiple tissues affected how you foresee that uh of how close could be i mean gene therapy to work yeah i i think that&amp;#39;s a very good question um i i think we are all um i would like to tell the story when i was in medical school many years ago uh when the human genome was cloned and everyone believed now that we understand genes and diseases we can fix every disease um but obviously it&amp;#39;s taken us a long time and i think there is understandably a lot of excitement for gene therapy and the potential for gene therapy for diseases including friedrich ataxia which results from a single gene so the idea is if you can replace the genes that aren&amp;#39;t working perfectly with the gene that&amp;#39;s working well can we fix the disease and i think that promise remains however i think as we&amp;#39;ve talked about it your research has shown as well uh getting from this idea or something that sounds biologically very simple and turning that into a therapy is a long road uh i think we have a lot of great minds working on this together which i think will help uh i think it&amp;#39;s uh i think there&amp;#39;s promise i think we are there&amp;#39;s now one gene therapy in the clinic uh that gen farmer shared for for the heart i think that&amp;#39;s a great sign uh i think we will learn and continue to get better and better at this and i i think it might be that the first gene therapies don&amp;#39;t aren&amp;#39;t cures but can actually help the disease and i think as we move forward we can think about and gene therapy advances right so that you can do repeat dosing or give one vector to the brain one vector to the heart one those types of things that i think we would all like to be able to achieve with gene therapy i&amp;#39;m not sure we&amp;#39;re there yet but you can definitely see that as i would say the stones on the path to get there thank you hello so discussion about the therapies and let&amp;#39;s say clinical trials what needs to be done so we can see more greek patients enrolled to such cases and i mean not a generic question who needs to do so have fun is to do something government who needs to do and what if you can answer that thank you thank you for this question um do you have anything to add on that because you have experience in global physical trials we have another question on the same line asking what the community could do to accelerate approvals but also accelerate access to trials globally since your company was in touch with different disability agencies and have run clinical trials globally can you give us an insight there so i will say that when you do clinical trials there&amp;#39;s many balances to try to include as many patients as possible but also um to make sure that you can efficiently get all the patients into the trial that you need i will say that this meeting today is from my point of view a tremendous success uh in in uh bringing the community in the future catastrophe community in greece together with the global community uh i think it raises awareness and showing that there is structure and the ability to participate in trials and i think you have a wonderful leader who i think is a great advocate vastly in advocating for bringing trials to greece i will also say that the friedrichs taxi research alliance i won&amp;#39;t speak for jen she can speak but i think he&amp;#39;s done a tremendous job in building a global network of trial sites to help um companies like us when we try to do clinical trials uh to already have uh leaders pointed out structure pointed out to allow for doing clinical trials which are a lot more complicated than just doing clinical medicine there&amp;#39;s a lot that goes into it that&amp;#39;s needed and the future taxi research alliance has done a tremendous a terrific job in setting up sites around the world if i may add a comment i think it is what&amp;#39;s really important is the existence of networks of clinical sites that work together for the natural history work together to develop and test biomarkers and work together in order to define how to best design a clinical trial there is a network like this in europe and greece is part of this network it&amp;#39;s called defects the european freedom catastrophe consortium for translational studies it&amp;#39;s initially funded by the european uh commission but now living our independent life and there is another consortium in the in north america but also extending to australia that is essentially supported by far right these two are planning to be integrated and work together in the future and this is essential because this will really offer the infrastructure to do trials that will not leave exclude anybody anywhere in the world from a clinical trial because you have and the companies that are doing clinical trials are going to be uh the uh let&amp;#39;s say the partner of the structure uh they uh are going to be invited to to to have a connection of the with this networks in terms in terms not only of of you know implementing the trials but also designing the trials in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t uh that doesn&amp;#39;t exclude anybody and in a way that is most effective to to get to the the you know to have the results that we want to know if something works to know to do if something is safe and effective so greece is part of the map greece is now is involved with the effects consortium and the infection consortium and the other country which is called the ccrn are going to be more integrated in the near future and offer really the possibility to everyone to be part of this thank you yeah i would add a more complexity to the questions that got from the audience as well about pediatric clinical trials on fa if any one of you could add couple of words on it on the feasibility and complexity of it so that will help the audience to understand why not much is happening in the pediatric population thank you well it&amp;#39;s not that not much is happening with the pediatric population is the fact that the pediatric population has specific regulatory needs i mean the regulatory agencies that have to authorize the trial and they eventually have to uh accept and uh the uh the therapeutics that come out from this this trial they unlicense them they have uh they have a specific requirement a fortune and this is perfectly justified uh children are not small adults as is usually said that they may be particularly vulnerable to certain treatments that they need to be assessed in a different way some of the outcome measures that we use in adults are not really that effective so we needed to design the trials specifically for children and we needed to make sure that something that looks safe in principle and adults is also safe for developing individuals like kids so there are a number of issues on the other hand if we think that we have a treatment that may be beneficial for children and children that can really benefit from it and i insisted on the fact that the earlier we treat the better it is we can have sort of an accelerated way of having the authorization of running trials in children but again since the patient population in ffa includes individuals so many different ages it is probably what you know the part of least resistance to start testing a treatment in adults getting faster approval to do that and then extend it to children with additional pre-clinical studies and uh that are required by agency but children are not at all forgotten and in the end that they will be the primary target of any type of treatment uh that that is supposed to stop or even to prevent to the appearance of certain symptoms yeah and i i guess i&amp;#39;d just add and say that there actually are clinical trials right now ongoing in kids the move fa studies in children uh some of the other clinical trials that are ongoing include include children so um you know we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll continue to kind of see a mix of clinical trials some of them starting in adults and then moving to kids um but it it depends on the treatment that&amp;#39;s being tested and what potential therapeutic impact we think it&amp;#39;ll have in terms of you know what the risk benefits might be to sort of figure out where you know what what the best population is to test to test the drug to start um so there are going to be different approaches for different drugs and i think that&amp;#39;s the other thing that&amp;#39;s important to keep in mind yes i mean the ptc trial is above age 7 and the minorics trial started at age 12. so we were including children at least adolescence in a number of trials that have already been thank you ghost this is very helpful uh mostly for the parents present today i think we have one last question from the audience and then we should move to the last speaker of the previous session who would like to join them so and you said there are uh no one needs to be excluded for from the trials and once they are also here in greece we can also all uh patients can may participate and my question is are there any prerequisites or any restrictions let&amp;#39;s say how um or more specifically how can patients and carers help from their side is there are there any steps to do to be done and to prepare the way to start let&amp;#39;s say clinical trial what should we do as carers and stations maybe uh you know i can i can i can give an answer and then i i think i have to apologize because they have my phone has been ringing many times from the hospital service today so i need to go but uh let&amp;#39;s put it this way you uh the best thing that you can do to help with clinical trials is first of all to uh be in a in a patient uh registry or database to uh to to make manifest to the to the research uh community that you are there and you are willing you may be willing to participate there are a number of ways there are the patient registries this is the pharah registries there are the fact of being included in the natural history studies the effects or or the c&amp;#39;s theorem study which is called the facoms there is a specific studies for children as well so there is a a friday cataxia app that is being developed and then you can just uh that you can just download on your phone and put your know your information in it and that may help you to uh to be in touch with what&amp;#39;s going on in the research world and even volunteer for for clinical studies so i think the main thing is to be in touch with the community to and to be uh in some kind of registry and don&amp;#39;t forget the app i think it&amp;#39;s a good opportunity now here to make some advertisement about the faa app it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s gonna be a very important tool and it&amp;#39;s available for apple and is available for uh google uh you know uh android-based systems thank you yeah and there the app is also um translated into multiple languages and you know just to add to um what massimo suggested i would i would also say the the other thing about you know being ready to participate in clinical trials is is what you&amp;#39;re doing today in terms of being educated and kind of really understanding what these treatments are um and how they&amp;#39;re being developed and you know what&amp;#39;s um what some of the risks and benefits are going to be and really thinking about what it might mean to be involved in a clinical trial and you know being involved in a clinical trial is a big commitment it involves you know going to a research center often multiple times over a short period of time sometimes it can be you know five to eight visits in six months and so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a big commitment personally for an individual and a family to make to to participate and sometimes it could involve you know additional medical procedures it can involve obviously taking an experimental medication and so really being educated and informed um on the therapies that are in development and also you know what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s required of a clinical trial is incredibly important and and something that i think all families should take very seriously thank you thank you to all i needed to go thank you all have candy store let&amp;#39;s carry polly but i need to stay here okay so thank you thank you jen thank you professor padolfo uh dr matt clyan thank you and uh dr miriam ray because your commitment to this event is impressive thank you for the for that it is very important and this is i say it as a first step in a close cooperation which actually means that we um we can be a reliable and uh honest partner and this is something very uh this is something that we started four years ago we build it daily and we can improve it and we are dedicated to invest resources in terms of clinical centers clinical sites and of course educating uh with uh participating in seminars our beloved doctors in this effort so thank you all for being here with us today i think i think that this was a great panel thank you thank you i&amp;#39;m sorry break in 15 minutes it&amp;#39;s my pleasure to introduce dr stephanie shirkey who was supposed to present at the clinical research for innovative treatments session she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s based in california san diego stephanie has earned her phd in paris and then she got specialized in stem cells and gene therapy at the scripps institute in san diego and afterwards she became associate professor at the university of california san diego at the department of pediatrics the division of genetics and she will speak today about her project on fa development thank you stephen thank you very much thank you everybody and thank you to the organizer for inviting me to this conference i&amp;#39;m sorry you know because of the time change i you know i had to um speak later but uh so i will speak about a project that is still in practical stage for free ataxia and it&amp;#39;s the use of gene therapy but in this case we are calling ex vivo gene therapy because we are using the hematopoietic stem cells so i just show that not to talk about free cataxia because you know i mean everybody knows but it&amp;#39;s just to point out that the issue with freddie kataxia as it was uh very uh well said by dr massimo is like you have to to um uh fix the issue in many uh in many organs in freely cataxia you have to target the brain the dorsal ganglion the spinal cord the heart and the muscle so to do so the approach we are using in my lab is like are using hematopoietic stem cells which are the stem cells that reside in our bone marrow and that have a capacity of being able to migrate to all the tissues and be able to integrate therefore along so um we use this approach of autologous hematopoietic stem cell that we use from the patient and we gene modify in a dish and after the patient goes through a chemotherapy to remove their own stem cells and then we infuse back the hematopoietic stem cells where they will reside there for the rest of the life of a patient and this is not science fiction you know we this is in in a clinical trial for many uh disease already and in our own lab we really went from preclinical to clinical for another disease called cysteinosis which is a multi-organ degenerative disease also and so as dr clan say it&amp;#39;s really important to know this how to do to go from bench to bedside and we have the capacity of doing that here so we went first in the mouse model of three capacity and we use the the stem cells uh from uh normal mice that were really green so we can track the cells after transplantation and we did a irradiation so it&amp;#39;s equivalent to the chemotherapy to remove the stem cells of the other mice and we did an infusion and what we&amp;#39;ve seen was very impressive is that the the mice that have received the free catastrophization stem cells had a normal locomotor activity that was equivalent to the wild type mass that you can see here i hope you see my my cursor um the non-treated mice are the most receiving cells from the disease mice were not you see that they have defective activity defective gait uh muscle strength and coordination whereas at the mice treated were uh equivalent to the white typewriters and we were um we checked the dosa rule gonglia where the the uh neurons die uh and you see that the two controls of the two disease mice uh they there is a death of the neurons whereas the mice that receive a white type metropolitic stem cells we could preserve the the neurons we also showed that the fratoxin expression was increasing the tissues in the brain in the spinal cord and that the mitochondrial function was uh improved and so that was very you know uh we can tell you you know a metabolic stem cells will make blood cells so how come this works so we know now that the hematopoietic stem cells the beauty of them is that they don&amp;#39;t have barrier they can go anywhere in the body um especially when there is like damage and so they uh can go here in the brain and you see all the green cells here the uh it&amp;#39;s very impressive a number of cells that we could see in the brain uh in the dorsal ganglia and spinal cord so again we do one bone marrow transplant and the cells do the job they go wherever they need to go and so what we showed is that these cells become microglial cells is a sort of macrophages that reside in the in the brain and what they do here they are in in red so the microbial cells that contain the frotaxin that we tagged with a a gfp fluorophore can now be seen in the neurons and this is what we think is that the hematopoietic stem cells become microglia in the brain spinal cord drg and they can transfer the frotax into the neurons to prevent weather but again the good thing about these cells is that they can also go to the heart and the muscle so we don&amp;#39;t need to do another anything else they do they they know where they have to go and if there is damage they go there and so you can see again also in the heart all the impressive number of hematopoietic stem cells in the heart and muscles and again we show that we have expression of the other fraternity increases personal products in in heart and muscle and improved of mitochondrial function so now we want to go to clinic and we want to then gene correct the cells however uh the because the gene in the case of cysteine is we add the gene and we and it&amp;#39;s over expressed but we know that in the case of frataxin the over expression can be toxic so we wanted to avoid that so what we are doing instead is a gene editing approach using crispr cas9 and we cut the elongation and so the good thing about that is that most of the patients will see with free cataxia have this uh expansion mutation so the same approach can be used for all the patients it&amp;#39;s in in intron so we can remove it it should it&amp;#39;s not affecting the gene and um and again because it&amp;#39;s we just cut the the gene itself then uh it&amp;#39;s expressed in the same uh in the same manner so it&amp;#39;s a regular regulated manner so we showed first in the patient cells uh that was a line uh that if we do that and this is the optimized version uh so if for example for this patient one or patient two you can see that uh we if we do this uh gene editing uh approach we end up with a over not over expression but uh increased expression of frataxin in this cells from an mrna level but also from a protein level so then um we um sorry uh we went and we use the hematopoietic stem cells from the patient because now we also want to make sure that there is nothing from the hematopoietic sensor from a patient that would prevent us to do that so we use uh volunteers i mean who kindly uh participated to visa to this um uh study and uh out of five patients we um give this approach of removing the ga repeat and we obtain a gene editing efficiency going from 12 a person to up to almost 56 percent and in these cells we showed that the fratexin expression was increased and the mitochondrial function was also improved so now we went back to the mice because now the next step is to show in a mouse model that we can uh have a disease uh uh improvement with this approach and all this step is what the fda requires so we can this is called pharmacology so we have to show that this works in a mouse model so the good thing about the mouse model we are using is that if there is no photoxy mirroring throtoxin but it has a human fratexing transgene so they express a fragile cintron gene that contains 800 ga repeat so this is a perfect for our method because we are using exactly the same reagent than we will use in patient and so we show that in their stem cells we can have we can cut the ga expression and when we transplant these cells back in the mice we show that we have received a gene editing cells that ungrafted in the hematopoietic tissues that&amp;#39;s good but also in the tissues like spinal cord heart brain and skeletal muscle which are impacted by the disease but what we were impressed with is that the uh the generating efficiency you know in this tissue was limited you know but when we look at the protein level the expression of a protein frotaxin comparing the non-edited mice as control with a mass receiving the stem cell that have been elited we see a a a really significant increase of a fratexin protein expression in all the a tissue that have been in fact affected by by the disease and we also showed that there is a improved of mitochondrial function like this is a marker for mitochondria biogenesis which also is improved in the spinal cord and heart of a mice receiving the stem cells that have been military and also the cardiac hypertrophy marker that was increasing the known uh in the disease mice are improved in the non in the mice receiving the stem cells that have been edited and so um we also the last thing we we&amp;#39;ve done is that we try to see if we could improve locomotor activity so in this new mouse model uh the the neurological defect is very minimal so but uh we found that the gate shows some um uh uh some of the some parameters of the gate are different in the in the disease mice and you can see for example the number of steps because they are smaller uh increase in the mice that are diseased and they also work with uh irregular irregular irregularity and uh the pressure is also different but what we look and again it&amp;#39;s a a small amount of mice so we hope to improve all this um uh is that we in the much receiving the stamp set that have been edited have an improvement so we show like disease uh improvement with this cells that have been edited so this is a i think a great step forward to be able to convince the fdsu to we we&amp;#39;ll move forward for a clean cultural later on and so this is what we want to do is take the stem cells from the patient uh gene edited them in a dish put them back and we hope that they will be able to integrate into the disease tissue and be able to provide uh the healthy protein in all this tissue and i just want to uh to finish to thank all the lab members who works in um in the uh in this project all the patients who participated to be study uh all the uh community and all the funding the nih pharah who has been a supporter of this project since the beginning and also for australia thank you so much any questions did you hear the questions i cannot hear sorry i don&amp;#39;t hear anything hello i&amp;#39;m judge koliakos from the university of thessaloniki and i would like to ask if you or anybody else has tried in a similar experiment mr themselves that may have a similar effect with heaven so that&amp;#39;s a very good question so in the project of cystinosis we we&amp;#39;ve done we tried in parallel the hematopoietic stem cells the mesenchymal stem cells and the whole bone marrow cells and actually the mesenchymal stem cells have only a short-term effect beneficial effect and now we know that these cells actually integrate very short term into the the tissue they don&amp;#39;t stay at the in contrast to hematopoietic stem cells so the mesocombat stem cells are really good for treating acute disease but they will not stay for a long time so it&amp;#39;s not good for the chronic uh agency disorder like pre cataxia thank you we don&amp;#39;t have one more question it&amp;#39;s coming the microphone is coming okay and thank you very nice data i have um a question um that at least my knowledge allergenic stem cell transplantation has not been used for a phase treatment so um i i wonder how um your approach um would uh provide um cure in all affected tissues i mean uh we know that um bone marrow stem cells can uh differentiate in microglia and of course restore the the brain damage but i wonder how this uh can benefit the the heart that&amp;#39;s a good question so in the heart and muscles we have shown and we have shown that also for cystinosis and others i&amp;#39;ve shown that is that they become macrophages resident macrophages so at the same time it&amp;#39;s the same family of the microbial cells and um and when they they reside in the tissue and they can transfer the protein to the diseased cells the same way then this happened to the in the in the brain thank you stephanie thanks a lot for joining today thank you very much panelists who are still here i think we do have a short break before moving to the 30 minutes okay we do have a half an hour break 30 minutes before moving to uh the two last sessions thank you i really impressed with the example that you said our next speaker is a big example i didn&amp;#39;t know that i am a journalist i should have known him and it is it will be a great honor to take an interview excellent kyle bryant is together with us it&amp;#39;s a great honor to be with us i give the floor to mr theodosis lapatas microphone she repeats again what she said earlier on mr brian kyle i repeat says the speaker is with us yep i got you all right i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;m not hearing the english version so excuse my delay but um thank you for having me um i assume this is where i should introduce myself um i just wanted to say that i really wish i was there with you um i have seen some pictures of some incredible friends and i&amp;#39;m so glad that you guys are doing this i think the global pandemic has a silver lining it&amp;#39;s brought us together a little bit as a community and i would never have been in touch with all of you and several other global communities in infrastructure attacks if it weren&amp;#39;t for the pandemic so i&amp;#39;m grateful for that thank you so much for your participation in the radish taxi global challenge as everyone knows may is faa awareness month and we&amp;#39;re all part spending in the land of some muscle global challenge and i encourage everyone to participate and unite as the global community so thanks so much for having me today hi guys welcome also to our final thank you for joining the first hellenic freezer had actually congress you have been inspiration for most of us in case you don&amp;#39;t know kyle he&amp;#39;s going to introduce himself in a bit but he has been a role model for the community of the global attacks members and we look forward to is i am a journalist i should have known him and it is it will be a great honor to take an interview hear us excellent kyle bryant is together with us it&amp;#39;s a great honor to be with us i give the floor to mr theodosis is repeats again what she said earlier on mr brian kyle i repeat uh so let&amp;#39;s do it because we&amp;#39;re a people of patents so we know how to do stuff right so all right i&amp;#39;m not hearing the english live stream of the live stream to watch i have seen some pictures of some incredible friends and i&amp;#39;m so glad that you guys are doing this let&amp;#39;s start with you okay i&amp;#39;m searching to please fully sorry for that i hope you hear the translation good evening dear kyle this is the interpreter speaking can you hear me my name is katarina i was nine years old when i was diagnosed with friedrichs ataxia and how do you see how have you experienced attacks here i am trying [Music] i&amp;#39;m trying harder and i feel that i can manage in the end tell us about something introduce us and let us know how ahazak has become a thing for you and you&amp;#39;re laughing your beloved ones okay uh hello everyone thank you for being with us here i am jessica pisa for ambassador from albania i am 26 years old and i was diagnosed with frieza texas when i was 19 years old i know it may sound a little bit ridiculous but i want to thank this disease for making today the person that i am more strong more powerful and thanks to this disease i have loved myself more and um don&amp;#39;t worry about that so let&amp;#39;s move let&amp;#39;s start here in also something yes it makes something [Music] i belong to the association of friedrichs ataxia i am extremely happy that at the last we have an organization of such a conference it was a dream of life i am 39 years old i was diagnosed when i was 20. in a period of time that nobody knew what friedrich ataxia is [Music] the first symptoms began when i was 17 with some light instability and i visited various doctors but nobody knew what was it [Music] and the diagnosis took place three years later [Music] the rest i will carry on later on good evening i am christopher i am 15 years old my twin sister i was diagnosed as well from a virus that i suffered we searched and we found out that it was friedrichs ataxia but we didn&amp;#39;t know [Music] exactly what was wrong with us until today that we have learned we have found that and i am very happy that i am here with all of you that you are helping i would like to thank you very much so kyle would you like to carry on please from albania i am 26 years old and i was diagnosed with mulching when i was 19 years old i know it may sound a little bit ridiculous but i want to thank this disease for making i i think i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;m hearing a bunch of um it&amp;#39;s repeating the audio anyway um if this is the right spot for me i&amp;#39;m gonna say i i live in i was born in california oh okay i think i got it now i was born in california and i got really involved in the fa community and started riding my bike and got more and more involved and fell in love with the people in the community and the friends i made and um i just wanted to keep going and that i think that&amp;#39;s where i find myself even today with the introduction to all of you and many more people in the global community and i&amp;#39;m really excited to be involved from here on out and see we can all do together thank you thank you so you have the floor i am extremely happy that you have invited me in this event i am 35 but two years before the first symptoms arose i was late to realize both myself and the people around me and i was not interested in doing something special about it but i will mention more details later so kyle what do you think we should discuss first keep us you know keep everything for us well i want to hear what everyone is proud of you know there are we&amp;#39;re all proud of things in our lives no matter what no matter what we&amp;#39;re dealing with whether it&amp;#39;s friedrich cytaxia or a lot of other challenges in life and i&amp;#39;d love to hear what everyone is proud of that i have got to know all these people that are here today i would like to thank you once again i did not really expect [Music] this to happen today that from my since i was eight years old and i am now 15 i did not expect so quickly to get to know so many people that they have the same disease and i have met really fabulous people excellent people wonderful people thank you very much once again i am proud for many things all these years that i am a patient with friedrichs ataxia first of all i am pride because i am still fighting it is very important for us patients to fight but also for our parents who we we are trying and we are trying to make them understand that we fight hard that we are we we are going to go to the end all together and i am proud that we made this association that is to say 20 years after i have been diagnosed two years ago only it was that we made an association because in greece and we found out in greece that we have many many people we all united and we became a family it is extremely important to talk in library facebook on the phone with uh males each and every one of us was alone but now we are all together i think it is extremely important and i am very proud that i participate in all these things i am very proud that we are a big family that we fight and we carry on fighting for all these things this disease has taught me how to love myself more how to accept myself as the way i am with my perfections at my imperfection if he has told me how to be quite patient and remind me this slowly is the fastest way to get where i want to be ready good evening once again i am proud because i didn&amp;#39;t know how much strength i had inside me and my family has helped me quite a lot in this and i didn&amp;#39;t believe that in the beginning i didn&amp;#39;t believe that we will manage that we will find a drug and i am proud that i am together with you here today and i am experiencing what i am experiencing really alex andrews what are you proud what are you proud about evening once again i am very proud that i got to know all these people that we speak together on a daily basis i am very proud of my parents my relatives my friends that they have supported me all these years and i am proud of myself that that i have never given up and i am still fighting but pride as you know is a daily issue and you have to fight for it every day every night 24 hours a day thank you later we can have questions sure but let&amp;#39;s have a question later okay so i think it&amp;#39;s my turn to say for what i&amp;#39;m proud of so a imperfect problem yeah yet i am proud of my family i am very proud of what has happened today all the effort that is taking place an umbrella and a storm which is called difficult access to people with uh rare diseases but what alexander said something said never give up never give up kyle so what are you proud i you know you guys really hit me right in the heart today just now um i&amp;#39;m you know in my head i was like all right i&amp;#39;m proud of all these things i&amp;#39;ve done um but i am so proud that i haven&amp;#39;t given up too i i feel like i&amp;#39;ve i&amp;#39;ve heard that from people to just now in this session and i&amp;#39;m proud of that as well and just sometimes just getting to the next day is the challenge right and then we come upon a beautiful day and we get to meet friends and we we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re proud of what we do and it&amp;#39;s because we got through that really tough day that we get to experience the beautiful things in life and i guess you know hearing all you say that that&amp;#39;s what i&amp;#39;m proud of as well is getting through the tough days to be able to get to the beautiful days nice nice thank you thank you for your for these very nice and wise words so what&amp;#39;s the next day kyle come on he&amp;#39;s going with the first question so we&amp;#39;re all here together to get to a treatment and a cure for fa for us and for many of our friends and it takes all of us to contribute to be able to get there all of us pushing in the same direction and so i want to know how everyone contributes to the fa community there&amp;#39;s so many different ways to contribute and you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not one thing it&amp;#39;s not two things there&amp;#39;s so many different ways and i want to hear how everyone contributes to the fa community sure let me translate here that&amp;#39;s access the guy is just translating what you have just said to speak with various people for the problems i am trying to make them understand [Music] do you believe that this way the community will get aware of what is happening yes jessica i think you have some questions yes okay well i try to spread awareness about fa all over the world through the social media especially on my instagram which is a page dedicated to fa i share their daily routines how i dance how i work everything i also coordinate meetings on skype with albanian and kosovo group there are a lot of people from albania kosovo north macedonia montenegro we speak this the same language and we every month we do our meetings there on skype and thank you thank you thank you jessica so let&amp;#39;s move to santa [Music] barbara i am helping the community i believe all of you have seen a photograph of mine in facebook the last three years three or four years i have taken photographs with banners i the friedrichs ataxia do something about it therefore i have an active participation in the social media which is a part of the society and it is very easy for us in the facebook or any page to see something to inform people to make people aware of what friedrich ataxia is now from then on i have participated as a vice president as a patient with my personal story i have given interviews to journalists in magazines periodicals on the internet and also a very significant part is education i have attended schools i have given speeches to students university students for my personal story i think this is extremely important for because they we let people know what are the rare diseases what is friedrichs ataxia and how is it to live and experience such a disease and from then on i have participated with kyle and farah for the last years in order in cycle riding organizations and since i have been involved with amateur sport i am a champion in riding i i am i yes i spent a lot of time in amateur sport it did something that gave me more courage and it is something that i highly recommend to all the other patients to get strength and make a step forward and through sport i can and i am given the opportunity to talk about friedrichs ataxia that&amp;#39;s all uh i talk about my instability because it is obvious to everybody and that and that&amp;#39;s how i go forward i have no hesitation to talk about it i like talking about it to every human being i meet because this way we give strength and courage to other people to express themselves and take out of their heart something that it is rare as i have something rare to speak openly about it and [Music] let people know what this reality is and help them and as i was helped i made a step forward i am in this position now that i have always been dreaming of i would i was i always wanted i have always wanted to have a drug discovered in order to be treated in order to have a therapeutic approach alexander as the previous speakers said i was speaking to people french acquaintances in at a younger age i went to schools primaries gymnasiums and i referred i mentioned the issues of my disease and therefore the people were informed about it they knew about me because i i was never isolated at home i was always going out into villages small towns in near my city of course i faced some problems of accessibility however these never never stopped me i never gave up and i still visited to primary schools because the main problem is the young children that they do not understand what this is all about and young children must be educated because they are going to grow up into the society my own experience and with three months we talked about friedrichs ataxia we made uh it was a a great campaign by kyle and chrysanthe was involved as well and we had the global recognization of ataxia we want to mobilize people and find a drug in order to achieve this people must know what you are talking about therefore to to try to make mobilize and inform people is great because i am saying that because we feel sometimes that we are different that we are rare therefore what i am trying to contribute i i work in marketing is how to bring into the circle of ataxia people that want to help and but i meet a lot of people who want to help and i think this is a very positive approach kyle how do you how do you contribute not all of us so share please do the thing with us yeah i you know first of all i want to say that you know i think if some people see a doctor that hasn&amp;#39;t seen fa before they hear that there&amp;#39;s nothing you can do and we feel a little helpless but when we when we hear from all the people in this pin just in this panel today we can really understand that there is so much we can do and there&amp;#39;s so many ways we can help the community and get closer to a treatment um for me you know i follow what i love to do i just i love to be on my trike and i love to be cycling as much as possible and to be able to turn that into a way to unite the community and raise funds and push research for a treatment and a cure to forward is just so fulfilling and amazing to me um and to do that in the context of so many other people globally pushing in the same direction it&amp;#39;s just so incredibly encouraging to to be a part of this community thank you thank you thank you i&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re pushing the awards for the community so much i think i have planned a bunch of questions but let&amp;#39;s do one more and then let&amp;#39;s try to get some questions from our guys that are on the room okay so hit us for the third time and then let&amp;#39;s go first time okay i think that one of the things that drives us is hope i think that&amp;#39;s a big part of life hope for the future and so what i want to know for everybody from everybody is what is your hope for the future podesta i hope that we are going to get this drug of course to be active and help us that&amp;#39;s it nothing more nothing less a very beautiful girl and my hope for the future [Music] is the good quality of life that can unite us and the good quality of life of our families which includes of course good quality of life in includes a series of factors and the drug a serious a series of things that we need so that we can all have good quality of life better access to treatment access to drugs access to everything and of course to remain all of us united and get and gather together that&amp;#39;s extremely important up to you i truly believe in a treatment or a cure for all of us it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time i know that the time will come and when the time will come i will look above the sky and say this is for you to all the friends that we lost because of british attacks of level i see my the future with this drug i believe that it will come up and that&amp;#39;s where all my hopes are alex i would like to say that of course it is self-evident that the drug or some kind of pharmaceutical help but the main thing is the way of life the quality of life because i i live in a village in a very small town and the quality of life is not good at all i am away from a big city athens thessalonika or some other big city life is of isolation and exclusion from everything the city of arta where i live there is no access anywhere for me of course i do not have such a problem because someone will help someone will do something for me but this is not only for me we are talking about the rest of the people because it&amp;#39;s me today in the wheelchair so tomorrow there will be something someone else and the way this way of life must change radically in all cities towns villages small big medium size that no difference thank you very much [Music] i want to have a look in the near future 2023. two patients with clinical studies in greece to have a drug and not to have access that is what i dread and i am really looking forward to the next panel to listen to these things finally in the association to organize something in order to have one chance one chance more one chance is one chance i my hope for the future is very similar to everybody else&amp;#39;s i i hope and i&amp;#39;m confident that we will get to a treatment for fa because we&amp;#39;ll never give up that&amp;#39;s one thing i heard from everyone today and that&amp;#39;s what makes me confident that we will get there eventually and our quality of life is very improved i think by coming together and just sharing with each other our challenges and realizing that we&amp;#39;re not alone and so my hope for the future is that that continues and we continue to to uh enable a better quality of life for each other thank you thank you so vasily let&amp;#39;s try to get some more stories from patients from you we had a great funnel thank you all thank you kyle thank you alex it&amp;#39;s a wonderful uh it was very touching it was fantastic so uh i think that this let&amp;#39;s say he wants to make a question so george please make a question hello kelly my friend in facebook how doing your exercises how much does it help you how the gym that you are doing is helping you to everyday life with attacks how how what&amp;#39;s helping me i&amp;#39;m sorry how gymnastics ah exercise yeah um i you know i think that exercise for me i think we can all feel it that if we don&amp;#39;t do it for a little while you can feel how it affects our body and i think that it is a matter of just keeping moving right and the more we do that i think a rising tide lifts all boats and so when we exercise i think it improves everything it improves the way we feel physically and the way we feel about ourselves just doing something for yourself i think uh improves self-confidence and while there&amp;#39;s so many physical um physical things about exercise that benefit the body there&amp;#39;s so much benefit to the mind and just the way you see yourself as well thank you thank you so vasily up to you so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s uh salute and uh upload all our panelists here it was a great great session we will keep on fighting and working all together thank you for being a role model for everyone else and you are an inspiration because you give uh uh you you get along you you you be in front and you and uh you give this let&amp;#39;s say opportunity to everyone to understand that as the girls uh told we if we will not speak for ourselves we cannot wait for others to speak for on our on our behalf so thank you again thank you thank you very much in us i think that we will have in us the last session and the panelists uh mr filippo and mr pauletti i will switch to to greek uh for the greek community so uh for the translation need to be again okay i would like to say good evening to the last panel of the day mr cole lettis who is the president of the national committee of clinical research professor of cardiology and mr philippe dimitrius president of the national organization of medicines and professor at the kapodistrian at university of athens also i would like to welcome the friend and specialist in rare diseases of ema pediatric committee specialist in clinical studies pediatrician member of 95 of herodias is the father of hermes thank you very much for being with us we would like to thank the mr colettis you have the floor thank you very much can you hear me well thank you very much for the invitation i am sorry that finally i couldn&amp;#39;t be there with you i have some thoughts i think that was the last session foreign thank you very much for being with us i know you are abroad i know that uh you took some time to be with us it is important because all of us all the patients all the community that are together with us believes that we are in very interesting times where uh treatment may be close we don&amp;#39;t know the horizon but it may be close therefore the role of the national medicine association is very important thank you very much you have the floor good evening thank you very much for inviting me uh if there was no case that i would be absent i am a doctor as you know i am devoted to patients it is a great pleasure to be in the first conference for friedrichs ataxia but i am in france i i don&amp;#39;t want to delay you i have a very brief presentation which aims at telling us where we stand regarding the new treatment what do we expect and how we can bring these treatments much closer to us as soon as possible we should know that uh we have managed to bring faster than any other country in europe treatment that patients need characteristic examples the uh many others now friedrich&amp;#39;s attacks here because i know the conference is bilingual i have made my slides in english so frederick&amp;#39;s a taxi i think all the distinguished guests because you had an excellent agenda and specialized people it is a rare disease with these symptoms but what is important is that we are in a period of time that we get away from the standardized treatments and we have more targeted research and is targeting into these three categories what is of direct interest for the patients is the development of the gene therapy in order to have the frataxin replacement which as we know is decisive for the development of the disease we are in the time where we have a turning point research in medical sciences directed into rare diseases together with the pharmaceutical industry we will try to find treatments from research that is promoted from the universities and then to research so if we see the map of research on the global level in the last 10 years we shall see that we have a lot of achievements for diseases that in the past were were thought to be not cured but things have changed radically and we are not talking about the improvement of quality of life but for the survival of patients with good quality of life i consider that your disease is one of the coming forthcoming ones we must have we must be a little bit patient why because the development of a drug is a process that it&amp;#39;s difficult from the thousands molecules that we have in order to have it to have them on the stage of clinical research will be a few very few and very few of them will come to the end user now because we are talking about a disease that it is a rare one of excellent interest therefore in our mind we should have that we are all going to be together and our organization is ready to give you any kind of advice and as we did with all the patients we can do it together we can have a meeting put everything around on the table and see how we can have faster access to whatever is being produced on an international level therefore as soon as we get away from this medical part the development assessment of the molecules we get to the part of the clinical clinical research that mr collette is going to talk about from this phase i think we can work together in cooperation with your doctors because we have specific centers that deal with friedrich artaxia so that we can get in touch with the companies and try to claim not only more studies but more patience from the challenge then what is of great importance we come to this party in commercially available drugs we are at the initial state the studies we have the studies but if we cannot have a very strict criteria to choose patients we will try to have two other options to the patients and this is early access patients that are excluded from the clinical studies can talk with the companies so that we can create programs of customized or group access what we will we achieve we will achieve the earlier possible to offer treatment that potentially will be effective to our patients because if you see the pharmaceutical market from the research clinical research to the introduction of the drug the marketing licensing and the compensation which is the process of hda in the negotiation committee there is a time limit that may be up to three years i do not consider that since we are talking about a small number of patients with heavy symptoms i don&amp;#39;t think we should wait all together we have to cooperate and find the easiest or easiest solutions the easy solutions are clinical studies with which we can get in touch with the companies with the centers so that we can have a big number of studies or a big number of patients in one study so that means that all the patients must be informed and those that fulfill the criteria to be included in the study the national medical association and the ethical code work very fast on the other hand the patients that do not fulfill the criteria will go to the other pillar which is to claim a program of early access either individual or group one so that as to have a drug as soon as possible because i consider that we are close to the development of gene therapy and there is the third solution for those that do not fulfill the previous two criteria are the doctors themselves and if there is the need the necessity for the drug after it has gone through the clinical the clinical research they can who can try to bring it through our request to aop so that it can come through the effect which is the subsidiary of our organization you are not you are not alone you are not you are not alone there are people around you here to help you so the cooperation that was large through covet pandemic is the way in order to have a better level of life you are not alone all the academia the research bodies the national bodies are with you the state is with you in order to offer you whatever is best i i consider that we are going to have good news for you very soon perhaps we should have a meeting in order to organize the next steps thank you very much indeed hope for the best thank you president indeed this is extremely important all this uh framework that you gave us and your contribution and of course we are going to meet in order to plan together the next steps i think that today&amp;#39;s event shows that the academia the scientists our doctors the companies that support this effort and the experiment and the patients and the regulatory authorities can be together i think all these things are very important thank you very much we have a very good experience you were always there and we hope that you will keep working with us so that we can have immediate access thank you mr colettis i think he&amp;#39;s ready good evening mr colettis hello again sorry about what happened to what went wrong before so i was saying that i wanted to share with you some thoughts i don&amp;#39;t know whether you can see my slides now yes we can ladies and gentlemen i think that it&amp;#39;s time with uh it&amp;#39;s time we think we thought it&amp;#39;s time we had some radical changes and in the way that we think in the field of research in the previous century we had a lot of progress in this field and as a result we observed a huge reduction of mortality from natural causes as mr philippu said this research was intensified furthermore i would say from the 90s onwards at a great degree however if we observe here i don&amp;#39;t know whether you can see the arrow you will see that in the last 20 years there has been a stability in mortality and a life expectancy at birth i have the data from the united nations as from 1950s today to i have chosen three countries united states switzerland and greece and this is the curve of life expectancy it is similar in the three countries let&amp;#39;s take greece for example and we see that after the big progress or in the previous century the last 20 years we see that this development has lost its potential it&amp;#39;s dynamic and although we have a huge increase in the number of clinical research impressive one we see in the last 20 years in 2000 up today you see the increase in the number of clinical research in clinical studies however today humanity is fighting with the suspects so that is to say cancer cardiovascular diseases and of course rare diseases that we are talking about today which as a number are over 7 000 rare diseases and in total they are not that rare because they are an average seven percent of diseases in europe here in the graph we see the private funds that have been given for the research and we see that the council of course has got the biggest number and then we have the other the other diseases and where diseases are not present in this graph in order to tackle this problem since 1983 in the united states we had a definition of the rare disease then we had the japan with the mission and then the rest of the countries the european union lasted which defined what a rare disease is and institutionalized what is orphan treatment and we see here the prerequisites and addresses to the pharmaceutical industry aiming at attracting the funds for orphan drugs for rare diseases these companies that choose to have these results they have some privileges consulting services from ema and local agencies they are relieved from some taxes and other privileges and of course the most important one is the exclusive distribution of the drug for 10 years but now this is the private sector now let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s see the funds from the public sector let&amp;#39;s take the country united states and we see the funds from 1994 till today from nih and we see after the big increase from the 90s that we said up to the beginning of our century we see a reduction a decrease of the funds from nih in total here we can see 2018 the public funds in the united states for medical research the number is huge it&amp;#39;s 14 billion dollars however it&amp;#39;s much less of the money for military equipment but even this money the 43 billion are not being are not given easily the researchers in the united states are obliged to write proposals on a constant they seize in order to carry out the research and to estimate that the 50 of the researchers time is writing proposals things are worse however there is something consoling small but of the percentage of the fund for research derives from non-profit organizations institutes this is the black one the black color was the one and the actions of the association for friedrichs ataxia it gives us a hope that this course of action can be i can carry on in greece i&amp;#39;m not going to tire you let&amp;#39;s go back to the initial question why although we have this research the expectancy the life expectancy is not increasing significantly also we have a [Music] scientific personnel very well trained and educated this is data from unesco which shows the number of post-graduate postdocs internationally that are trained in a specific center you see we have a huge leap in the number and the main one is we see the number of publications in medicine here you can see this is impressive up to 1990 we had a little increase in from 1990 we have an exponential increase into the number of uh medical publications in recent years only they are more than all the period of time since the second world war until the beginning of the century why why is this happening this paradox is happening the reasons are very many however i believe that one reason that i want to highlight is the clinical researches the promotion i believe that political researchers are the king of uh very often though are taking place without adequate pre-clinical data without sufficient adequate support the clinical studies are the king and the biggest part of the research 90 of the funds are given for clinical studies and only 10 for pre-clinical studies and how is it possible of this paradox we are in society of knowledge and why are we lagging behind because there is a big difference between knowledge and comprehension understanding comprehension understanding means the plethora of knowledge that we possess to connect to to connect the puzzle and and shape up a hypothesis which hypothesis or a supposition will be studied in pre-clinical periods of time and on clinical uh clinical research and there must be no we should not have a gap we should have a channel of communication of pre-clinical research all the support the hypotheses should to be trialled in clinical research is not a c clinical resources as a yes or a no or a p-value the questions that arise from the clinical research is to get back to the basic research the pre-clinical research and to be studied from scratch and as mr philippe said i think this field is the field in which we have the pharmaceutical industry and the universities meet it is the sector that they have to cooperate these two bodies aiming at progress and the common good and i think it&amp;#39;s they both can gain they can get the bad things of the academic society which perhaps the research is not useless and science has a surprises and of course the universities they can contribute and they can take a lot from the pharmaceutical companies the organization the targeting and so they can get out of the crisis that we have in universities not only greece i believe but globally in something last i believe that the history has taught us that progress in the field of medical science and research and technology in general must go hand in hand with the development of uh values and if there is if these two things do not go hand in hand then we have a crisis in culture in the crisis in value let&amp;#39;s go back in 1961 where two american scientists discovered the vaccine for hollow the vaccine had was very cheap and as a result millions of children saved and let&amp;#39;s compare it with today&amp;#39;s situation with the vaccines for coving the president ladies and gentlemen i think the message of the conference is that together we are going to win says it all all the stakeholders public private sector the state the auditing the universities the academia must unite for the common good for the progress into the medical biological research thank you very much and i believe indeed that the exemplary change will be put into practice thank you very much thank you mr colettis i am sure that we proved today that together we will manage because many times we say things that they sound nice but when you invest on this when you make steps of cooperation then you become a valuable collaborator through continuous improvement of the effort and through actions we can have a really hopeful result thank you very much because we have both of you here today i would like to raise a question because we have many participants from our area this is not like belgium that the clinical terrorists are integrated at hospital so we can have a hot spot at aries regions that will be beneficial for neighboring countries and the community how far away is this idea to be implemented in the previous two meetings that we had we raised this issue how we can be a more international center we have requests from india to participate to have patients participating in clinical priorities i think this can be achieved it is feasible we raised all the legal and the practical issues the introduction of the patient is not the problem we don&amp;#39;t care whether the patient comes up from north macedonia or greece etc the problem is structural we have not followed the course of the other countries only in recent years we have exerted huge efforts in order to create the conditions here to have clinical trials so we see the pollen although we have many clinical trials in numbers the number of patients that participate is very small why because we&amp;#39;re not fully organized so what i would see as a first phase to have the legislative framework for clinical trials at hospitals we have some interventions there the second thing is to train the staff because don&amp;#39;t forget clinical trials are completely different we&amp;#39;re talking about a high quality provision of services certified so the centers must be certified the specific training and control is required at the same time the training of the staff and the third point is that the patient should be informed because it&amp;#39;s not only you that tried to find the solution many patients in the past did not the same clinical trials they positively they thought that they were drinking one of the good things the positive things that the covet pandemic gave us is that uh it familiarized us with the idea of the clinical trial so we need the gradual approach infrastructure personnel staff and patients many things have been done and we will continue to do many things we need your cooperation don&amp;#39;t forget that so positive thing that we could say and we could draw from these meetings today is to coordinate a meeting of all informed parties and the companies that are active in clinical trials because we need specialized centers in order to have the clinical trials the things we move forward you have to inform your people love all the therapeutic choices and all the data that i think we hire the for the patients themselves and the carers because of this disease the role of the character is of crucial importance thank you very much mr colettis mr philippo for your contribution echo operation offer of course we are going to cooperate do our very best so that our patients you will see that the state is studying by them thank you very much good night i think that this was a very friendly day you have a picture from the pediatric committee of ema i think that we cover the big part of the spectrum starting from symptomatic treatment up to clinical trials basic research and of course we listen to the stories of our patients and their regulatory framework what is the conclusion the message that you can draw i think that it is a unique confidence unique meeting because you are unique our children are unique and this means that we keep trying because i&amp;#39;m 20 years old ahead children have different names and different faces what i can the patriarchy is more than 70 percent everything that is new in the development all over the world is a foreign disease the big part is from neuromuscular diseases this is not accidental which is that there is much interest i can give you a message from our prediction that 40 years later the last 10 years we started with seven clinical trials and nowadays we have 7p clinical trials in the usa europe all over the world there is cooperation between our associations and the second thing is that the last 10 years there were very small groups population but what increased their life expectant expectancy by seven years is the care given our children each one of us has a role to play scientist regulators have a specific possibly you as patients and we as parents you the carers you have to play your own part today and our job is to fight for tomorrow these are my final words i was very proud to be with you thank you for the invitation and honestly i can tell you that we belong to the same community to the same family i think that with this optimistic message we&amp;#39;re going to end today&amp;#39;s conference thank you very much all of you that attended the conference although it is quite late we would like to thank the pharmaceutical companies that supported us the physicians and the researchers and our family becomes stronger every day better every day thank you very much everybody that participated in the success of today&amp;#39;s conference and of course i will ask you not to stay this success i work for institute the pastor institute i am here for you an excellent center the center of excellence for neurodegenerative disease they serve me personally i have worked for many years at various hospitals and i have experienced study of stigma marginalization the hope and despair but i&amp;#39;m here today because a taxi visited my family 40 years ago diagnosed at the age of 13 and now aged 53. is quite small for this diseases and this was an opportunity to meet mr karate and all of you internet technology writing for you right these are the things that this person does i have experienced i repeat again attacks here because of this member of my family and i know the feelings of the families that have to face the idea of the chronic disease and the unknown two things that changes of emotions in the same way self despair hope and despair if the drug that we&amp;#39;re expecting two days is not here and many times this is a threat for the family congestion the first drug that you have is a family love support all the members and the second thing is the quality of life and access we live in a city that does not have a specific parts pedestrian for pedestrians so we have what you think of all the parameters for our lives must be able to go around in the city we are vulnerable to people that are self-help i have experienced this as well and this is my conclusion never stop trusting science and never become victims of people that are not scientists and try to sell treatments ask for the help of your physicians and be sure that very soon you are going to have the drug that you are expected and i remember that i had a director in the past that used to say that appointments are set booked by life my mother has a autoimmune disease her name is machi fight and i am committed that everything that you may need to help you to stand by you i don&amp;#39;t move very easily but today was very much moved by yourself you",

say with me today any warriors please help me in welcoming the fabulous Matt Lafleur everybody ok let&amp;#39;s go into the first part of our interview so this episode focuses on when you kind of started to get symptoms when you were really little and then with that later revealed diagnosis and then keep on listening and able to rise to find out how today&amp;#39;s guest then coach I&amp;#39;m thrived afterwards in episode 2 with some added questions from our neighbor warriors Facebook group if we have any and keep on listening for episode 3 for today&amp;#39;s guest answers to the not so super quick secrets wrong okay let&amp;#39;s drive straight in to part 1 tell us about your diagnosis at age 11 Matt like what happened on that day of your diagnosis did you have any sense was leading up to it at all sure every kind of support you can imagine but at around the time I watched channel 11 my which cultures would tell me that I&amp;#39;m getting behind all of my classmates so well everyone else is really good at like throwing the ball and kicking the ball and running I was struggling to keep up with them so I would practice by myself every day and it wouldn&amp;#39;t really improve anything so I didn&amp;#39;t know what was wrong one of my coaches point out to me that I had extremely flat feet so we went and checked on them and a podiatrist and we discovered that yeah I do me a flat feet but that wasn&amp;#39;t the issue so after they finally diagnosed me with Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia oh so you were just 11 at the time like that was that super young to be diagnosed with something so big as well I could just take a pill or do a surgery and everything would be better but reading about what Friedreich&amp;#39;s is and how most people with they end up in a wheelchair by the time they are in their late teens I couldn&amp;#39;t really comprehend that additionally that destroyed me I am I couldn&amp;#39;t see myself not being able to walk really hard pill to swallow I can imagine and how did that kind of impact your parents as well because they must have been super scared my parents were absolutely destroyed by this they were really heartbroken by it they you know in some ways blame themselves for having the gene too bad so on yeah I totally do not blame them for not one me been known to all with children with their BAE that or any disorder that you are the ones who gave us life here the ones who helped us be able to enjoy the world to thrive and survive and you&amp;#39;re not we don&amp;#39;t blame you for whatever issues we may have to deal with yeah so it really just heard them to see me struggling to do things I was formerly able to do like play sports and you know keep up with all my other friends they it heard them to watch me struggle to keep up with them yeah and I&amp;#39;m like how did you climb a nice up because like when you obviously at like 11 it&amp;#39;s that age where you&amp;#39;re about to go into it being a teenager and things like that like how did you kind of relate to your friends still or did they drift away you know as a preteen was to fit in with everyone else oh yeah blend in with the grad but only I had this disorder that would that was affecting my um my dexterity and it may be clumsy pretty much hmm you know I couldn&amp;#39;t no longer just blend in I always feel like I had a spotlight on me whether I wanted better or not okay you know so it was an ongoing battle of panic you know I knew I was one to survive I just didn&amp;#39;t quite know how and it would take me a while to realize that for most i buda they as a stumbling-block as my way of not being able to reach as i had someone like to reach only recently with my job and with everything going on that FA are free drinks seems to me to be unnecessarily a roadblock or an impediment but part of who i am part of me that enables me to maybe be a little bit more in pathetic otherwise would be maybe to reach out to other it&amp;#39;s a little more deeply than i would be able to without it that&amp;#39;s incredible that all concepts of changing what you thought was a great evil to something that well still is not to be celebrated can definitely be seen to have benefits absolutely yeah quito is a little bit more about what Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia actually is and what it&amp;#39;s like to kind of have that you know something is really wrong with my legs hmm it&amp;#39;s a baby nerves do not communicate with my brain lady should so without that communication going that muscles tend to atrophy and be of disuse so that that&amp;#39;s a tag live I like believe it is all about frustration because um my brain says that my lathe in my arm that everything should be able to do a B and C should be able to do all of these everyday tasks and when I&amp;#39;m able to do that well when I do them a little a little bit off kilter it&amp;#39;s um it&amp;#39;s really hurtful it&amp;#39;s really aggravating yeah my head there&amp;#39;s no reason I shouldn&amp;#39;t be able to get up and go to the other room but my body softly so that is an incredible amount of frustration and it&amp;#39;s kind of um easy to see how in many cases that leads to negative thoughts about our own bodies I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve been there but you have to I think I learned to be a little more compassionate toward your own body a knowledge that my body is doing the best I can you know it has this thing FA that makes the things more difficult for it but that&amp;#39;s the same with me you know I&amp;#39;m trying to do the best I can&amp;#39;t Eve you know fa is out there so yeah it&amp;#39;s not about hitting anything it&amp;#39;s about seeing the struggles your face and overcoming them absolutely yeah and I think you&amp;#39;ve had such an interest in journey as well so this cause kind of started when you were about eleven so leading up to where you are now dare I ask how old you are am I allowed I&amp;#39;m 34 first time I looked up the prognosis for FA it said um most people would if he&amp;#39;d die when they are 33 counts bad you&amp;#39;re gonna completely crush that that yeah you&amp;#39;re not just beat you&amp;#39;re not you can absolutely crush it thank you worry Wow so how did it feel to actually get that prognosis credibly you know you know probably let the depression in my deal with yeah I can imagine oh I think you&amp;#39;re amazing for carry on I&amp;#39;m going already do you want any treatments at the moment to kind of try to prolong life as much as possible or is it more of a like a symptom management day-to-day kind of thing Oh currently there are no official treatments so yeah it&amp;#39;s all symptomatic I have found like little things like if they can&amp;#39;t see the coughs I do things that prevent me from coughing image which is really interesting in this time a corona virus begins coughing is a really scary thing yeah yeah FA is there is no treatment for it it&amp;#39;s all set semantics right we&amp;#39;re getting close there man it&amp;#39;s in the works it&amp;#39;s in the works that&amp;#39;s good so before we go into part two what do you think would be your main tips for living well with with FA okay I have two things that I want to mention one is one they both are thinking that I&amp;#39;m still learning but the first is not adhere to a victim&amp;#39;s mindset to not CFA or whatever condition you may face or whatever thing is in your life that you wish weren&amp;#39;t in there hmm don&amp;#39;t let that be your jailer don&amp;#39;t let that be something hold your bag keeps you from being the person you want to be because it is not that you are so much more than whatever lives in your way and you have to see that and you can&amp;#39;t let yourself be victimized but whatever is in your way and say your thing I would say is always keep I&amp;#39;m not very physical so I did this in my head but always keep a list of what you can do when you were able to and who you are and what you love and he goes a to separate list and never confused that you never met who you are is defined by what you can do because that is a non behavior at all and that is a hard lesson we&amp;#39;re not still trying to learn and master but it is so true that&amp;#39;s amazing advice Matt thank you so much and enabled raise that&amp;#39;s it for part 1 episode 1 it&amp;#39;s all wrapped up in the next episode we will discuss the amazing things that my husband since his diagnosis now look at warriors for episode 2 because you will not want

    "transcript": "hey y&amp;#39;all uh so my name&amp;#39;s Cliff Clifton uh I&amp;#39;m going to do a video of my own experiences with the sky Claires um this is not uh done by the pharmaceutical company it&amp;#39;s not done by Pharaoh it&amp;#39;s done by me it&amp;#39;s strictly my own experience um so I asked a bunch of y&amp;#39;all to leave me questions so that way I could try and answer all of your questions uh different things so I want to make sure that I cover it all um I&amp;#39;m not gonna add anybody&amp;#39;s last name but I will use their first names so mind you on experiences so here we go okay so I&amp;#39;m doing this up my computer um so uh Jamie um a last name um if you can&amp;#39;t see physical improvements but only a number of movements by a small percentage on a piece of paper how is it helping patients and exercise is still the most effective method for fa uh start much for question but it is a question um so my thought is yes extras is a huge improvement with fa the more we exercise the more you put yourself the better the results the medicine will help with that I definitely recommend that in my experience that everyone that is on it you do some kind of physical therapy occupational therapy it will help it helped me it has helped a few other people I would go with it physical exercise is one of the most effective ways that we have to fight against this so my recommendation would be to do that um so you know with in your safety field I mean don&amp;#39;t do anything crazy um let&amp;#39;s see if it&amp;#39;s a small percentage um everyone&amp;#39;s gonna be a little different uh it I don&amp;#39;t even know how to explain the percentage um because everybody is going to be completely different um so with me I did notice a few things there was better control over myself none of anything else really that I think can think of I could move better without having to hold on to everything if I did start stumble I could control myself better instead of doing the fa Shuffle I could make it stop and hold myself up um there was one instance where I was in a parking lot and I was doing something I don&amp;#39;t even remember what I was doing and my Walker rolled away um let go of the Walker first but second to do something and it was a little off to my side and I had one hand on it and I let go in return to something I never ruined my pain I&amp;#39;m just kind of turned a little bit like this I&amp;#39;m going to turn back the Walkers rolled away um so I stood there without falling for a little for five minutes I&amp;#39;d call that pretty good um considering I probably never would have been able to do that I would have definitely followed my butt or just sat down um so as saying something I don&amp;#39;t know what it says but it&amp;#39;s something I would definitely call that a little bit more than just a percentage so at least that was me uh let&amp;#39;s see here uh Renee asked I&amp;#39;m curious about side effects um did not experience any major side effects I didn&amp;#39;t notice anything and not like my mouth was dry or bathroom issues or anything like that um I don&amp;#39;t know I I didn&amp;#39;t really notice any side effects um so I I would say no but everyone is different so no it&amp;#39;s a lot of device um let&amp;#39;s see Deanna I hope I&amp;#39;m pronouncing that right Deanna um how long did you did you feel how long did it take before you felt improvements and do you feel you&amp;#39;ve maintained your improvements uh it does take about two to three weeks for the medicine to get into your system and that&amp;#39;s what almost anything um I feel like I have plateaued on my improvements um I&amp;#39;m sure if I really really worked at it and you know did a bunch more physical therapy and stuff like that it might get better and the Beautiful you can definitely try it and hopefully you will get better um if you are friends with Chandra she is definitely proving that with some serious hard work and determination that you push boundaries back quite a bit um so it&amp;#39;s definitely helping I mean when I was younger maybe I am 41 years old so yeah I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not gonna try it I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m fairly happy I not thrilled to death with the fact that I walk with the Walker but at least I&amp;#39;m still moving so yeah it&amp;#39;s something to be said at 41 years of age and still moving so yeah take it as it is um let&amp;#39;s see um Jerry asked best improvements uh I would definitely say being able to can control myself um like I said not falling not necessarily having to grab onto everything when I do miss something not just be first and whatever I was going for there is there is some stability there I definitely need to work on a lot of this because well I&amp;#39;m in shape and around his shape so yeah I could definitely do with a little less like this um so let&amp;#39;s see uh Karen asked uh side effects did it help with any fine motor skills or anything not dropping stuff uh I&amp;#39;ll definitely say no side effects again um the mother skills did help there was a better reaction uh like if I drop something fork or whatever usually I could catch it um not necessarily with same man but if I drop something I get real quick you know just um looting slap it to me and we&amp;#39;re good which makes horrible math and it upsets my dog because she doesn&amp;#39;t get any of her food falling on the floor and you know four-legged Fergie animals they survive on things that we dropped so she was not super happy about that but as far as like cell phone I drop stuff on a thousand times a day I don&amp;#39;t even think anything about it you know study uh pretty pretty good case on it so yeah uh it didn&amp;#39;t help with cell phone but it does help with uh somebody does a little stuff like that I better luck uh with my tools and stuff I don&amp;#39;t drop tools I don&amp;#39;t fumble with them in my finger that&amp;#39;s what I did um let&amp;#39;s see uh Aaron I didn&amp;#39;t hear him say um Erin asked what Improvement did you notice first um honestly I can&amp;#39;t tell you exactly what&amp;#39;s improvements I noticed first um did I was taking the Forest test and the sir test um any y&amp;#39;all are familiar um probably certain all of y&amp;#39;all are familiar with those um the major one that I noticed was the Bengal to stand uh feet apart so normal feet apart and not touch anything the meaning will stand there um I could definitely uh as things went on the medicine went on I definitely got longer where I could stand there without having to grab the counter or a doctor or fall over or whatever so to me that was a huge Improvement because I&amp;#39;m like yeah I was used to all know for all the time uh let&amp;#39;s see said uh when improvements did you notice over time with improvements slight medium of significant um I would definitely call that a significant Improvement everything else has been fairly medium um I mean there there is better control this is uh gonna be one of those medicines where you can take it and instantly you&amp;#39;re gonna notice like you don&amp;#39;t have to work far is definitely going to be one of the things that you&amp;#39;re gonna work so and the more you push yourself the more you want to get something or you know set a goal for yourself then that&amp;#39;s something where you&amp;#39;re going to be my goal was to be able to stand without touching anything and I I got there so that was Michael ultimately um uh she has did it elevate your liver blood work yes it does elevate liver enzymes um I&amp;#39;m not sure how much but everyone&amp;#39;s different uh I guess I was where they made me stop taking the meds and stuff but yes personal elevation in liver enzymes I couldn&amp;#39;t tell you much or whatever it goes I don&amp;#39;t know anything about that so uh she asked if things have plateaued over time and I would definitely say I I planted but again 41 years old so hoping a lot more of y&amp;#39;all this will help quite a bit and if you do Plateau it&amp;#39;ll be in a better place than where you are right now ha yeah I would definitely say mine has reach a plateau but it&amp;#39;s really stable um it&amp;#39;s comfortable I&amp;#39;m happy with it I&amp;#39;m not super thrilled about the Walker and everything else but it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s a comfortable place I can still do what I want to do um moms get tired but I think that&amp;#39;s for me it&amp;#39;s a H let&amp;#39;s see what else we have here um last couple of questions um Brooke asked about uh she was curious about eyesight specifically nostagmus yes nystagmus um honestly I don&amp;#39;t know uh I do have some astagment art nystagmus in my left eye but I attributed it to my age um I&amp;#39;ll say where contacts because hitting the ground and having glasses go fly and not being able to see anything was very bad it wasn&amp;#39;t wasn&amp;#39;t good uh so but my contacts my prescription has not changed except for that and that has only come on and last six months or so and I&amp;#39;ve been on the meds for for a long time a little over almost six years so called and I just noticed the nystagmus this last year so um yeah and usually it was just it would be like really clear in this eye and then everything would just blur out like it I don&amp;#39;t know if it got too close or what nor would you blur out so I can still see it as this one and if I adjusted this contact it would clear up and my last herb for five or ten minutes then it would slowly blur it again so now real sure what that was I think it was me but and it could be everybody it&amp;#39;s a little different likes that um see Brooke um Brooke said really appreciated uh a lot of same questions um physical activity uh could you do the board no uh Brooke asked if we had to avoid all alcohol and I would say definitely not um I still you know drink a little here and there um and and hasn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s not changing anything um and shoot when I was younger when I would drink I would actually walk a little straighter um if it makes sense the noise in my brain would stop and my walking would be more focused on walking so I guess that&amp;#39;s a drunk trait but whatever uh let&amp;#39;s see um no things did not I wouldn&amp;#39;t see anything of change physical improvements I told you about standing um let&amp;#39;s see if there is progression I mean it is that bad it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an inevitable fight um but I mean like I said I&amp;#39;m older this is me um it&amp;#39;s a plant is plateaued I can&amp;#39;t tell if it&amp;#39;s solely dropping but if it is it&amp;#39;s very slowly so that&amp;#39;s a big big bonus in my book um let&amp;#39;s see uh uh Cindy old same questions oh by answered all your questions Cindy um uh see if as the percentage of improvements honestly don&amp;#39;t know how to Freight uh personage improvements um I don&amp;#39;t know um I really I don&amp;#39;t even know how to rate a percentage of improvement um I&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s pretty good it&amp;#39;s moderate definitely I don&amp;#39;t know definitely over 70 60 percent I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t even don&amp;#39;t even know I&amp;#39;m even gonna begin to try to answer that uh so uh uh bar Group bar I&amp;#39;m not sure but yeah uh that was the last question so yeah uh I hope this helps all of y&amp;#39;all um like you said this is my experience um I&amp;#39;m gonna try and include uh Sandra sent me a little clip so I&amp;#39;m gonna try and include that on here we&amp;#39;ll see um if I can get it done or not so um it&amp;#39;s this is gonna be one of those things where it&amp;#39;s everybody&amp;#39;s experience um yeah oh crap oh come on let&amp;#39;s chop the computer oh that&amp;#39;s right a little bit nope certainly right down there we go okay so I&amp;#39;m gonna close it this time um I would definitely say that it&amp;#39;s gonna be everyone&amp;#39;s experience um like I said this is one of those things the more you set a goal or goals for yourselves the more it&amp;#39;s going to help uh keep keep pushing yourself safely but push yourself you know I mean if your hobby is skydiving okay cool uh I wouldn&amp;#39;t say you&amp;#39;re

best way to do it do one every do one a month um yeah do a video months let&amp;#39;s find them somewhere and just hit record and walk down the hallway and see how the video looks and then in a month do the same thing and and six months go by and look at it you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll see there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a difference there&amp;#39;s an improvement you know it&amp;#39;s this is it

I also have a neurodegenerative muscular disease called Fredreich&amp;#39;s Ataxia which, as you can see, causes me speech problems and overall muscular problems, as well as balance and fatigue issues. And it&amp;#39;s a disease that won&amp;#39;t stop, even if I kind of control it through physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. So, any involuntary movement you see me make or anything my muscles do, is because of this disease. Well, and now let me tell you a little about Liant la Troca, what it is and what we do Liant la Troca is an inclusive dance company  where everybody is welcome, disabled or not  Many people think that it&amp;#39;s a dance company only for disabled people because, you know, we, all these poor souls with a disability  we can&amp;#39;t dance in a regular company,    we can&amp;#39;t do what normative people can do, so... ...we&amp;#39;ve created a company just for us. And no, not at all!  We have professional dancers, all kinds of people  You can come too, if you wish, those who are watching this video  In our website,   Liant la Troca  you will find all our shows,  our next projects  If you prefer something quieter  I&amp;#39;d recommend &amp;quot;Sin/Contacto&amp;quot;,  a very beautiful show for all ages  If you go for something harder, I&amp;#39;d tell you to go and see &amp;quot;Trencats&amp;quot; (Broken)   which, frankly, I wouldn&amp;#39;t tell you to bring your kids.  But, hey, to each their own  Well, at the end of this video you&amp;#39;ll see a clip to give you an idea of what we do   Thank you very much for watching Please share this video  and let&amp;#39;s work together for a more inclusive society  ...and let&amp;#39;s all learn from each other.

different experience yeah I am proud that I have got to know all these people that are here today I would like to thank you once again I did not really expect [Music] this to happen today that from my

I did not expect so quickly to get to know so many people that they have the same disease and I have met really fabulous people excellent people wonderful people thank you very much once again I am proud for many things for all these years that I am a patient with friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia first of all I am Pride because I am still fighting it is very important for us patients to fight but also for our parents who we we are trying and we are trying to make them understand that we fight hard that we are we we are going to go to the end all together and I am Pride that we made this Association that is to say 20 years I have been diagnosed two years ago only it was that we made an association because in Greece and we found out in Greece that we have many many people we all United and we became a family it is extremely important to talk in library Facebook on the phone who is a males each and every one of us was alone but now we are all together I think it is extremely important and I am very proud that I participate in all these things I am very proud that we are a big family that we fight and we carry on fighting for all these things this college literally your your view no uh this disease has taught me how to love myself more how to accept myself as the way I am with my Perfections at my imperfection if he has told me how it would be quite patient and remind me that slowly is the fastest way to get where I want to be live on it good evening once again I am proud because I didn&amp;#39;t know how much strength I had inside me and my family has helped me quite a lot in English and I didn&amp;#39;t believe that in the beginning I didn&amp;#39;t believe that we will manage that we will find a drug and I am proud that I am together with you here today and I am experiencing what I am experiencing really what are you proud what are you proud about good evening once again I am very proud that I got to know all these people that we speak together on a daily basis I am very proud of my parents my relatives my friends that they have supported me all these years and I am proud of myself that that I have never given up and I am still fighting but Pride as you know is a daily issue and you have to fight for it every day every night 24 hours a day thank you oh yeah hey later you can have questions sure no words but let&amp;#39;s have a question later okay so I think it&amp;#39;s my room to say for what I&amp;#39;m proud of so a imperfect problems I am proud of my family my wife I am very proud of what has happened today all the effort that is taking place we have an umbrella and a storm which is called difficult access to people with uh um rare diseases but what Alexanders something said and never give up never give up Kyle so what are you prideful I you know you guys really hit me right in the heart today just now um I&amp;#39;m you know in my head I was like all right I&amp;#39;m proud of all these things I&amp;#39;ve done um but I am so proud that I haven&amp;#39;t given up too I I feel like I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve heard that from people to just now in this session and I&amp;#39;m proud of that as well and just sometimes just getting to the next day is the challenge right and then we come upon a beautiful day and we get to meet friends and we we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re proud of what we do and it&amp;#39;s because we got through that really tough day that we get to experience the beautiful things in life and I guess and you know hearing all you say that that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m proud of as well is uh getting through the tough days to be able to get to the beautiful base nice not nice thank you thank you for your for this very nice and wise words so what&amp;#39;s next is the first question so we&amp;#39;re all here together to get to a treatment and a cure for fa for us and for many of our friends and it takes all of us to contribute to be able to get there all of us pushing in the same direction and so I want to know how everyone contributes to the fa Community there&amp;#39;s so many different ways to contribute and you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not one thing it&amp;#39;s not two things there&amp;#39;s so many different ways I don&amp;#39;t want to hear how everyone contributes to the fa community sure let me translate here Caterina the guy is just translating what you have just said to speak with various people for the problems I am trying to make them understand [Music] do you believe that this way the community will get aware and what is happening yes Jessica well I tried to spread awareness about fa all over the world through the social media especially on my Instagram which is a pH dedicated to fa I share their daily routines how I dance how I work everything uh I also coordinate meetings on Skype with the opinion and Kosovo group uh there are a lot of people from Albania Kosovo North Macedonia Montenegro we speak this the same language and we every month we do our meetings there on Skype and thank you thank you thank you Jessica so let&amp;#39;s move to Santa [Music] I am helping the community I believe all of you have seen a photograph of mine in Facebook the last three years three or four years I have been taking photographs with banners I the Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia do something about it therefore I have an active participation in the social media is a part of the society and it is very easy for us we&amp;#39;re in the Facebook or any page to see something to inform people to make people aware of what Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia is now from then on I have participated as a vice president it does amazing with my personal story I have given interviews to journalists in magazines periodicals on the internet and also a very significant part is education I have attended this course I have a given speeches to students a University students for my personal story I think this is extremely important for me because they we let people know what are the rare diseases what is Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia and how is it to live and experience such a disease from then on I have participated with Kyle and Hara riding organizations and since I have been involved with amateur sport I am a champion in riding I I am I yes I spend a lot of time in some other Sport and it&amp;#39;s something that gave me more courage and it is something that I highly recommend to all the other patients to get strength and make a step forward and through sport I can and I am given the opportunity to talk about Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia that&amp;#39;s all uh every young person that I meet I talk about my instability because it is obvious to everybody and that and that&amp;#39;s how I go forward I have no hesitation to talk about it I like talking about it to every human being I meet because this way we give strength and courage to other people to express themselves and take out of their heart something that it is rare as I have something rare to speak openly about it and let people know what this reality is and help them and as I was helped I made a step forward I am in this position now that I have always been dreaming of I would I was I always wanted I have always wanted to have a drug discovered in order to be treated in order to have a therapeutic approach Alexandra yes as the previous speakers said I was speaking to people friends acquaintances in at a younger age I went to schools primary schools gymnasiums and I referred I mentioned the issues of my disease and therefore the people were informed about it they knew about me because I I was never isolated at home I was always going out into Villages small towns in near my city of course I faced some problems of accessibility however this never never stopped me I never gave up and I still visit to primary schools because the main problem is the young children that they do not understand what this is all about and young children must be educated because they are going to grow up into the society foreign was involved as well and we had the global recognization of ataxia we want to mobilize people and find a drug in order to achieve this people must know what you are talking about therefore to be to try to mobilize and inform people is great because I am saying that because we feel sometimes that we are different that we are rare therefore what I am trying to contribute I I work in marketing is how to bring into the circle of ataxia people that want to help and I meet a lot of people who want to help and I think this is a very positive approach Kyle how do you go how do you contribute all of us so share please the thing with us yeah I you know first of all I want to say that you know I think if some people see a doctor that hasn&amp;#39;t seen fa before they hear that there&amp;#39;s nothing you can do and we feel a little helpless but when we when we hear from all the people in this pin just in this panel today we can really understand that there is so much we can do and there&amp;#39;s so many ways we can help the community and get closer to a treatment um for me you know I follow what I love to do I just I love to be on my track and I love to be cycling as much as possible and to be able to turn that into a way to unite the community and raise funds and push uh research for a treatment in a cure to forward is just so fulfilling and amazing to me um and to do that in the context of so many other people globally pushing in the same direction it&amp;#39;s just so incredibly encouraging to to be a part of this community thank you thank you thank you I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re pushing there weren&amp;#39;t for the community so much I think you have planned a bunch of questions but let&amp;#39;s do one more and then let&amp;#39;s try to get some questions from our guys that are on the room okay so hit us for the third time and then let&amp;#39;s go first time okay I think that one of the things that drives us is hope I think that&amp;#39;s a big part of life hope for the future and so what I want to know for everybody from everybody is what is your hope for the future um I I hope that we are going to get this drug of course to be active and help us that&amp;#39;s it nothing more nothing less yes it is a hope that we have um a very beautiful girl punch My Hope for the future is the good quality of life that can unite us and the good quality of life of our families which includes of course good quality of life in includes a series of factors and the drug a series a series of things that we need so that we can all have good quality of life better access to a treatment access to drugs access to everything and of course to remain all of us unite and get and gather together that&amp;#39;s extremely important that&amp;#39;s up to you um I truly believe in a treatment or a cure for all of us it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time I know that the time will come and when the time will come I will look about the sky and say this is for you to all the friends that we lost because of British attacks yeah foreign the future with this drug I believe that it will come up and that&amp;#39;s where all my hopes are Alex I would like to say that of course it is self-evident that the drugs or some kind of pharmaceutical help but the main thing is the way of life the quality of life because I see I live in a village in a very small town and the quality of life is not good at all I am away from a big city Athens thessalonica or some other big city life is of isolation and exclusion from everything the city of Arta where I live there is no access anywhere for me of course I do not have such a problem because someone will help someone will do something for me but this is not only for me we are talking about the rest of the people because it&amp;#39;s me today in the wheelchair so tomorrow there will be something someone else and the way this way of life must change radically in all cities towns villages small big medium size that no difference thank you very much apart from the long-term hope which is a drug I want to have a look in the near future 2023 two patients with clinical studies in Greece who is one hope another hope to have a drug and not to have access that is what I dread and I am really looking forward to the next panel to listen to these things speaker of the microphone foreign finally I have a hope that finally as it was said earlier on something organized that is to be given the opportunity in an organized way with the help of a vasilis and the association to organize something in order to have one chance one chance more One Chance is one chance Kyle I My Hope for the future is very similar to everybody else&amp;#39;s I I hope and I&amp;#39;m confident that we will get to a treatment for fa because we&amp;#39;ll never give up that&amp;#39;s one thing I heard from everyone today and that&amp;#39;s what makes me confident that we will get there eventually and our quality of life is very improved I think by coming together and just sharing with each other our challenges and realizing that we&amp;#39;re not alone and so my hope for the future is that that continues and we continue to to uh uh enable a better quality of life for each other thank you thank you right so Vasily let&amp;#39;s try to get some more stories from patients we had a great panel thank you all thank you fantastic so uh I think that uh this let&amp;#39;s say so George please make a question I guess so hello Kelly my friend in Facebook uh exercises help you out of a hundred percent doing your exercises how much does it help you how the gym that you are doing is helping you to Everyday Life with attraction how how what&amp;#39;s helping me I&amp;#39;m sorry how gymnastics ah exercise yeah um I you know I think that exercise for me I think we can all feel that if we don&amp;#39;t do it for a little while you can feel how it affects their body and I think that it is a matter of just keeping moving right and the more we do that I think a rising tide lifts all boats and so when we exercise I think it improves everything it improves the way we feel physically and the way we feel about ourselves just doing something for yourself I think uh improves self-confidence and while there&amp;#39;s so many physical um physical things about exercise that benefit the body there&amp;#39;s so much benefit to the mind and just the way you see yourself as well then you think about it up to you so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s uh salute all our panel is here it was a great great session we will keep on fighting and working all together for this inspirational uh kids and patients you are in a family and Kyle thank you for being a role model for everyone else and you are an inspiration because you give a you you get along you you you you be in from and you and you give this let&amp;#39;s say opportunity to everyone to understand that as the girls told we if we will not speak for ourselves we cannot wait for others to speak for oh now on our behalf so thank you again thank you thank you very much",

    "transcript": "[Music] you are listening to the two disabled dudes podcast I&amp;#39;m Kyle Bryant and I&amp;#39;m Sean bombstar and together we are navigating life with disability hello world welcome to the podcast here here it is what do what do you think of the opening was that pretty good or what no I I think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a good way to to welcome every everybody yeah we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re reaching out to the world here you know this this is our White Flag hey world come lesson White Flag are we giving up we&amp;#39;re surrendering no we&amp;#39;re just yeah I guess you&amp;#39;re right I don&amp;#39;t know what it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not white anyway uh this is the podcast we are doing a podcast now um and I think that&amp;#39;s crazy partly because uh we are just kind of learning as we go we didn&amp;#39;t know what we were doing before like 4 months ago and we spent the last four months like just figuring out how to make it happen I I think that&amp;#39;s probably true though most things we do in our lives we don&amp;#39;t really know what we&amp;#39;re doing then we got to spend several months just figuring it out yeah yeah I mean it&amp;#39;s happened for us between us like you know three or four times before where I go hey Sean um I think we should ride our bikes to Las Vegas let&amp;#39;s do it yeah yeah exactly and that&amp;#39;s the response I get I didn&amp;#39;t even have a bike at that time do you remember that we sat down I&amp;#39;m pretty sure the restaurant was water boy or the one right next door Rubicon Rubicon yeah and and you we were talking about the ride tax c 2 back then they were numbers not necessarily designated event cities um and we were doing number two which was from Sacramento to Vegas number to like right attacked to not like number two yeah good point thank you um and you&amp;#39;re were like hey I&amp;#39;m going to do this Vegas let&amp;#39;s try to get some people and I&amp;#39;m like shoot I want to help but I don&amp;#39;t have a bike I better get one yeah yeah so that&amp;#39;s how it works I mean we uh neither of us knew any well I guess we knew a little bit because we&amp;#39;d both been on a guest on like a podcast before um but other than that we didn&amp;#39;t know anything about how to get it done true we we just knew we wanted to do one and we thought we might do okay doing one together so hopefully somebody else thinks that same thing yep yep that is the hope I hope um I hope more people are listening than just like my mom and your mom that&amp;#39;s you know well I&amp;#39;m sure your dad is listening too so that&amp;#39;s a bonus okay yeah and maybe uncle Steve hey Uncle [Laughter] Steve cool oh man all right so where did this come from how how uh how did we get started on this Kyle well so I um it really I was I was watching the movie the documentary that we&amp;#39;re both in and just realizing how much stuff is in there that just is sort of applicable to everyday life and you know partly it was just me wanting to discuss it and figure it out more and go a little bit deeper in some of the topics and I was like oh that would be good for a podcast and then somebody called me up or no emailed me and invited me on one of their podcasts and um and it went really well and I I was like you know what if they can do it I think Sean and I can do it and um so that&amp;#39;s kind of where it came from and I called you up on my way back from an event I was driving H with a handsfree headset so um trying to be safe in the car and uh you know we start talking and um theid we wanted to do and four months later here we are yeah hopefully this we we&amp;#39;re getting it all worked out you know there were a lot of things we had to figure out once we both decided that yeah yeah let&amp;#39;s do a podcast then you know the so many Logistics of do we have the right equipment your computer my computer what do we what do we really need to pull this thing off and I know you did a bunch of research online and really figured out that if we had halfway decent microphones we might be able to record a halfway decent conversation between the two of us yeah yeah and one thing that we should point out is um Sean is on the west coast and Kyle that&amp;#39;s me is on the east coast and so that&amp;#39;s really we had to figure that one out like what how are we going to record this when we&amp;#39;re not even in the same room and uh I think it&amp;#39;s working out so we got we got a Skype call going right now and um and that&amp;#39;s kind of how it&amp;#39;s working out so what do you hope to accomplish with this podcast Sean well you know I ultimately I hope to get rich and famous and if this is not really that&amp;#39;s not what you said before you know I I think with this podcast I just hope to be a voice of encouragement for a lot of people uh dealing with Fredrick&amp;#39;s taxi or other conditions and um you know obviously we&amp;#39;re both threatened with this shortterm life and I hope to be able to leave a positive Mark and contribute whatever I can and you know I jokingly said it not too long ago in uh a patient panel in Florida you and I were both there I think I a joking I said something like you know if if I had a million dollars to give I would but since I don&amp;#39;t have money money what can I do and part of my contribution is really just being available and sharing my experiences as I go and hopefully it it adds value to somebody else along the way yeah and I think you know a lot of it where it comes from is that you and I enjoy talking to each other um and we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re comfortable talking about well I am anyway I hope I hope you are too I hope that&amp;#39;s a shared Comfort it is um talking about our our disease something that we share that not very many other people in the world share um and we love being able to feel comfortable talking about it and um you know I feel comfortable with you and lots of my other friends that have fa or other Progressive diseases depilating diseases and um and so just talking about it I think is um goes a long way in the conversation and I I hope that some other people feel Comfort hearing us talk about it too I guess um and maybe that&amp;#39;s you know and and that&amp;#39;s where the conversation starts and we hope that this podcast starts a few conversations to paint a correlation there&amp;#39;s so much I believe so much um it&amp;#39;s going to sound cliche but some power when you begin talking about things it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have as much of a stronghold or grip on on your your mental energy or the way you&amp;#39;re pursuing life so I when you sit here and and you&amp;#39;d say things like talk about this condition or other things similar it reminds me of stories I&amp;#39;ve heard from you where it took you some time to get to a point where you were talking about your diagnosis and I am hoping that the more conversations like ours are available and out there it empowers other people to move along in their process and talk about things whether it&amp;#39;s the condition or certain symptoms or certain challenges they face every day yeah I think I mean I think you hit it right on you know and um like you said when I was first diagnosed I didn&amp;#39;t talk about it for a couple years um even with my close friends or family um I just didn&amp;#39;t know how and I just wasn&amp;#39;t emotionally prepared to do that I just wasn&amp;#39;t prepared to do that at age 17 and I think that you know my family was incredible because what my parents you know during the time when I wasn&amp;#39;t ready to talk about it they were going to support group meetings they were looking stuff up online and and and starting to discover all these things as hard as that was um to see the future of what this disease had in store for our family um you know when I was ready to talk about it they were prepared with at least the beginning of answers and you know at at the very least they knew where to find the answers we might be looking for um and so but you know when we started talking about it um that&amp;#39;s kind of a turning point in my life when I started facing up to this disease and facing this Challenge and being like all right here it is what are we going to do with it you know and the first step was just acknowledging it sure what do you what do you think this is a question I haven&amp;#39;t asked you before and I haven&amp;#39;t heard you talk on it but I know it took you two years to get to the point where you started to face it and talk about it why do you suppose it took you that long I know you were young emotionally a different place than maybe you are today but even the age of 17 what do you suppose is something or some of the reasons that kept you from from talking about it um I I I think I thought a lot of myself um you know I didn&amp;#39;t want to uh have a reason to think less of myself and hopefully maybe that&amp;#39;s something that a lot of people um hold in common but you know just uh facing the reality of the situation like I think we all have this vision for our lives right and to see that crumble and totally changing and trying to figure out how I&amp;#39;m going to handle that change um I just was not ready for that and I think I just delayed that facing that reality as as long as possible sure so tell us since since we already started this why you um will you tell us what began to happen in your life after those two years passed and you started talking about it so it started as soon as I could start talking about it um that&amp;#39;s when we that&amp;#39;s what allowed action I think to enter the picture uh when I was so scared to talk about it you know it was kind of paralyzing um and once I faced it and I realized I had so many so much support around me in my family and my friends I realized that I could do this and you know this isn&amp;#39;t going to totally crush me let&amp;#39;s do something about it let&amp;#39;s rethink the future rethink what this means for my life because it&amp;#39;s life is not over um which was definitely one thought that entered my mind and there&amp;#39;s a lot more life to live so let&amp;#39;s figure out what to do with it and the it that Kyle is talking about we&amp;#39;ll get into a little more detail here momentarily but Kyle said it and I think I did too Frederick&amp;#39;s Axia is the disease neuromuscular condition that Kyle and I have both been diagnosed with Kyle at the age of 17 me at the age of 25 and causes a whole bunch of damage to our entire body and threatens to end life early due to heart disease but um Kyle was really good at at explaining the science behind this disease so Kyle we to that in a minute but the it that we&amp;#39;re talking about what would you say um you know once you began to talk about it and like you said it it allowed for Action to enter the picture and begin to be a part of the journey what are some of the steps you you initially took um these are tough questions dude so I think really it began with just being able to think past fa and think past this huge insurmountable challenge that it seemed to be um and that&amp;#39;s when ideas started forming in my head with how am I going to respond to this challenge um and I think that&amp;#39;s really how it began like sort of just in my head being able to think about it and you know a few years later we started I started realizing that we need to take action and um so we did so I I looked online and I saw this guy who was about to circumnavigate the country on a tricycle he had Ms and he was standing next to his strike on this web page and I was reading about him and um I was like oh my gosh I think I can do that and uh so I started looking into it more and more and I found a trike dealer near where I was and I drove up there one weekend and I went for a test ride in the parking lot and I was like holy cow I can finally move under my own power I hadn&amp;#39;t I hadn&amp;#39;t walked very far for like several years and all of a sudden I could move down the street at um you know 20 mph if I wanted to under my own power and know I think I just started visualizing where it could take me and uh so in 2007 so my first bike ride was 7 miles and um I was so proud of myself I couldn&amp;#39;t believe I I had that I could do that and um and now I did 14 and 25 and then 50 and then um only 4 months after my first ride I went for a centry ride wow and um I was the last one on the road but I I finished it I did it it&amp;#39;s huge and from then on the sky was the limit sure so uh I decided to do a cross country bike ride um starting in San Diego my dad and I rode our bikes to Memphis Tennessee and my mom drove the support vehicle and it was an insane adventure and it was just the beginning we we finished this bike ride and we empowered ourselves and I was writing a Blog about every 3 days during that ride and um really the the ride started the the movement really started when people were responding to my blog posts with comments and being like hey this is awesome you know I really respect what you&amp;#39;re doing and it&amp;#39;s really encouraging me in my life um and seeing how art actions were affecting other people was really how the ride concept started and um you know over the next couple years we did two more longdistance bike rides and now I&amp;#39;m on staff at the friedrick at taxi a research Alliance and we have a series of bike rides across the country we have six our Network right now and um you know anyone is uh we have we have routes from 5 to 50 miles um and anyone is invited to come out and be empowered and push themselves and contribute to the cause um and so that that is the long and short of how it got started so when you talk about those rides and the contribution to the cause what is the what is the effect of those six different rides every every year today so uh so the the purpose is to raise money for research um a lot a lot more goes on um as far as connections between people and empowerment and awareness and stuff like that but um when we&amp;#39;re talking numbers the ride raises about $800,000 a year for fa research and um for the past several years we&amp;#39;ve had over 2,000 bar Spence wow that&amp;#39;s incredible and like I said there beyond the money those events are so incredible for fostering community and in empowering people to be involved and to you know take action like you said and they also it helps Foster growth and connection among that Community I know I&amp;#39;ve only been able to do a few of those rides myself but it&amp;#39;s the highlight of the spring at least for the Northern California ride because you get to see in and hang out with so many amazing people that we&amp;#39;ve come to know and meet and almost every year you meet a handful of new ones and it&amp;#39;s just an exciting thing to be a part of so uh for whatever it&amp;#39;s worth KY I&amp;#39;m glad you started riding your bike and I&amp;#39;m glad that I&amp;#39;ve been able to ride along with you for some of those event sorry I just kicked my microphone it it happens anyway I think it&amp;#39;s uh the bike the bike is really what&amp;#39;s helped you and I stay involved with each other but it&amp;#39;s the diagnosis that you and I that brought us together I was diagnosed in 2007 I was 25 and immediately got online and trying to learn a little more than what the doctor said over the course of about an hour so I went home that night I was just playing around on the internet keyword searching all over and Kyle that ride AC Ross the country that you mentioned you had just done it two or 3 months prior and since we were from the same city or we are from the same area uh you were all over my local news you know the Sacramento be and different news channels so on Google it had all the stuff showing up and I&amp;#39;m like oh why is why is local news talking about this sky and the spike R so the more I read and dug the more I realized that you and I were the same age that were from the same city and you were diagnosed and living with the same disease that I had just learned about that day so at some point over the course of a few days I think I tracked down some sort of email address for you shot out an email and tried to meet and connect with Kyle and find out okay what what can you tell me what am I up against knowing that somebody else was in the area with the same diagnos and I think it was just 3 weeks later or maybe two weeks that we met for a pizza and a beer Down Town Sacramento yeah man I I remember that and um I just remember being feeling empowered because just there&amp;#39;s somebody else like you know I think that&amp;#39;s one of the tough things specifically with a rare disease and with the fa you know fa is is 1 in 50,000 people as you know Sean and um that&amp;#39;s about 5,000 people in the US and so you know when most people that are not involved in the fa Community if they&amp;#39;re listening right now they&amp;#39;ve probably never heard the words fried&amp;#39;s a taxi before um and so when you&amp;#39;re first diagnosed you feel so alone and isolated and just to have someone to talk to about it like we were saying before maybe I&amp;#39;m repeating myself but um you know that that meeting over beers was just to have someone to have a beer with and understand what um what you&amp;#39;re going through was was incredible you know I think it&amp;#39;s funny that we mentioned beer because one of the symptoms of Frederick&amp;#39;s attx is this total gate distribution so it causes us to have a lack of of control and balance control of our muscles especially legs and arms and of course a a destroyed sense of balance and a slurred speech you can probably hear it in our talk today so really it&amp;#39;s symptomatic of being incredibly inebriated and I remember being at the restaurant and back then I I was a good boy and I didn&amp;#39;t really drink much of anything and I remember you had ordered a beer and I was I still hadn&amp;#39;t experienced too many symptoms but I the doctor told me about them and I read all about them and I experienced them to some degree I remember asking you specifically if it was okay for you to have that beer or if it was going to make things worse for you yep because even then I didn&amp;#39;t know the effects of it yeah yeah and um of course you know it does make things worse um if if you&amp;#39;re talking about the physical symptoms sure um and of course that&amp;#39;s only temporary but um you know so it is absolutely to be used in moderation and um you know uh with a certain amount of perspective and um respect but you know it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not going to kill you yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not well like I said it&amp;#39;s good to knowe that the the heightened symptoms of or yeah the heightened uh effect is just temporary it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not going to cause any permanent damage right just and so because you drink so um I think we should probably let our listeners know um and point out specifically that um we&amp;#39;re not drunk right now right Sean I mean I guess I&amp;#39;m 3,000 mil away from you so and I can&amp;#39;t see beyond the uh your computer screen so you could be drunk but anyway uh I one of one of the symptoms you know so fa affects all muscle coordination from the toes to the fingertips um and a group of those muscles are muscles we use to talk um and so that&amp;#39;s why we sound like we&amp;#39;re drunk we haven&amp;#39;t been drinking um but uh that&amp;#39;s why we sound like it so um the genetics of fa so DNA is a series of codes and one of those codes is GAA um most of the general public has less than 30 repeats of GAA at that code in their DNA I have 400 50 some of our friends with fa have over a th000 up to like 1,500 repeats of GAA in their DNA when that code gets decoded it makes a protein called Freight taxin I don&amp;#39;t make enough fre taxin Sean doesn&amp;#39;t make enough fre taxon all of our friends with fa they lack fre taxon and um so that is the thing that causes dysfunction it causes um things like extreme um uh fatigue chronic fatigue and um you know third speech uh uh balance of coordination issues and vision loss hearing loss and life shortening heart complications unfortunately hard complications are the thing the the leading cause of death for somebody with fa and um so this is uh uh you know a life and death situ situation we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re talking about so when we&amp;#39;re raising funds and awareness and stuff um you know people see me or they see you and they&amp;#39;re like what&amp;#39;s the big deal like you&amp;#39;re in a wheelchair yeah that&amp;#39;s a bummer and your speech is a little slurred um you know but when they&amp;#39;re looking at me or you that person is not seeing the total devastation of this disease and it affects other people much more severely um you know and that&amp;#39;s what we are working to um to reverse and um so a little more about fa um how it&amp;#39;s inherited which is a common question is so it&amp;#39;s a double recessive trait so I got one bad genene from Mom and one bad genene from Dad but they had no idea because they had no symptoms I had a 25% chance of receiving receiving both of their um recessive jeans and I was the lucky recipient same same thing with Sean too so um it&amp;#39;s inherited the same way and um so like I mentioned before that&amp;#39;s 150,000 people that is affected by fa um but the alarming thing is that one in 100 people are carriers and uh it just takes two carriers that don&amp;#39;t know that they are carriers to get together and then um their child has a 25% chance of of getting fa when when they&amp;#39;re born so um and it&amp;#39;s a progressive disease as well I think that&amp;#39;s something to uh understand um so I mean I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve had it and Sean has had it um our whole lives but for me I didn&amp;#39;t know until I was 17 sha I think you were like 26 right 25 25 so um and as we get older the disease gets worse and um as of now there is no treatment or cure um but that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re working to change we&amp;#39;ve got lots of shots on goal in research and um and Drug trials Sean you just were you actually at UCLA in the trial today uh I was I flew home today but the trial that I am a part of um all of my assessments ended last night so um yeah I did just come back today although I didn&amp;#39;t have any appointments this morning just a flight home okay so yeah like I said there&amp;#39;s you know with no cure or treatment at this time there there are so many amazing efforts right now moving the needle forward and in the pipeline to help effectively stop or cure this condition and it&amp;#39;s exciting to to be around it to be a part of it and to help the process for me one of the one of the coolest things that I look at when I&amp;#39;m able to you know like I said in the beginning of the conversation I don&amp;#39;t have millions to give but what I do have is time to chat with you like we are right now but then also I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m happy to sort of volunteer my body so to speak to these trials because the way I see it whether whether this particular trial that I&amp;#39;m doing right now or that particular drug over there over here has a positive effect it has an effect that helps us move forward because either it tells us yes we&amp;#39;re on the right track let&amp;#39;s keep moving in that direction or no the answer isn&amp;#39;t that way let&amp;#39;s go this way now and whatever the answer is for me it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s uh exciting to be a part of that part of that process to move us toward a cure I don&amp;#39;t know if that made sense yeah it totally makes sense and it it really brings up an opportunity for me to talk about Farah the Frederick&amp;#39;s ATT taxi our research Alliance um I&amp;#39;m on staff at Farah and we are the largest fun of fa research in the world um and we fund a lot of seed grants that help scientists get um much larger grants from bigger organizations like the NIH but really we um we encourage research all over the world and work with other um sister organizations just like us as well in other countries and um develop ideas and work with Scientists to make connections that really keep the research going and um one of the principles you talked about be just now was that you know if something doesn&amp;#39;t work then we go a different direction right and um you know the the principle phah research pipeline is very deep and diverse and we have eight or nine different ways to approach the disease and within those different approaches there are several different projects going on and so we know that we have to have many shots on goal or many egg eggs and manyi baskets whatever uh whatever metaphor you want to use but many pucks on the ice yeah there you go pucks on the ice I think I made that up all right maybe we can maybe we can do an episode a little later down the road where all we do is think of different metaphors for that um approach all right sweet so uh anyway that is Farah and um you know we really facilitate research like I said with lots of different partners um including you know government Partners farmer Partners Lab Partners scientific Partners um you know International other International organizations and really you know with one main focus of treating and curing frick it taxia and really um it all stems from well a lot of it you know we have a strong culture of focus and collaboration and really that is led by our co-founder and president Ron BK um he&amp;#39;s just an amazing human being who really survives off of like smiles and hugs and um really you know any group he&amp;#39;s in he promotes collaboration over everything else and um you know everyone in the organization and everyone that knows him knows that he stands for collaboration and everyone follows when they&amp;#39;re when they&amp;#39;re around him and so um thank you to Ron Park but also you know just that I really come to know that that is so important just focus and um in principles and everyone on the same page in our organization we have an amazing board of directors and we have a really strong mission and vision that everyone really adheres to and looks at and keeps it in mind in everything we&amp;#39;re doing and um it&amp;#39;s just I feel very fortunate to be working for Farah and to be in the community that that we are both in you know there&amp;#39;s a part of me I just think yeah you&amp;#39;re super cool you have a cool job I B groceries for living uh whatever but anyway there&amp;#39;s a part of me Kyle that uh really I I think you have a great job and I love the the part you get to play in the organization and I&amp;#39;m not going to lie I um I send a letter and a petition to Ron every March asking him to replace you with me whoa okay that&amp;#39;s not true I&amp;#39;ve never done that although I J said something to Jennifer Farmer once the the fact that you even said that that makes me a little concerned man I need to step up my game or maybe a Farah just needs to open a West Coast office so I can get involved there all right all things to work on right well I think it&amp;#39;s cool and I love that you shared so much about phah because at the end of the day no matter what we&amp;#39;re doing or no matter what the day job is or our level of progression or our level of ability all things said and done like I said Farah is the leading organization worldwide leading the efforts in battling this condition so it&amp;#39;s an exciting organization to be connected to to be related to uh to help with and to do whatever we can to move the needle forward which like you mentioned this um drug trial I&amp;#39;m doing right now is facilitated because of organizations or really because of Farah so um even though I&amp;#39;m not on staff I&amp;#39;m happy to be connected to him and be a part of the community and whatever whatever capacity I can be awesome um so a little earlier I talked about collaboration and um you know we&amp;#39;re part of a of a much bigger Community as well Sean and and um so fa affects one in 50,000 that&amp;#39;s about 5,000 people in the US um the the definition of a rare disease in the US is a disease that now has a population of less than 200,000 people um and we you know fa has 5,000 people so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s pretty rare and um but if we consider ourselves in the group of rare diseases in general all these diseases that have a population of less than 2,200,000 that&amp;#39;s 7,000 different diseases and that means there&amp;#39;s 25 million people in the US that have a rare disease um and that makes our numbers a little more powerful I think and so a lot of the work that Farah does is collaborating with other rare disease organizations and doing work on behalf of all rare diseases cuz really we&amp;#39;re on this together and and we&amp;#39;re all after the same thing you know uh a treatment and a cure for for our specific disease MH that&amp;#39;s true I think you also make it&amp;#39;s a good point and also helps tie in really part of the reason why you and I are doing this podcast sure we want to call attention to Frederick&amp;#39;s attack here we want to help raise awareness but it goes beyond that particular disease itself which is really what I think help bring you and I together and we have the thing the same thought process of making the most out of life while we can simply because we can and really part of the reason why we&amp;#39;re even having these conversations together is to help encourage people people in the world to do the same whether they&amp;#39;re up against Fredrick&amp;#39;s ATT taxia or Huntington or Ms or cancer or whatever the issue is there&amp;#39;s still so much more life than just that condition or just that disease and I think you you made a great Point earlier when you asked the question Kyle what can I do in spite of it or what can I do with this in mind how can I still take action even though I&amp;#39;m living with with this condition and that&amp;#39;s really a part of the reason why you and I are having this conversation um today and every other day that we record yep yeah and yeah and to have this conversation and include so many other people that have you know a similar mindset I think is it&amp;#39;s one of the things I&amp;#39;m excited about I mean this is our first episode and I&amp;#39;m just excited to see what happens really and just to to hope that these conversations are just the beginning of of hopefully what might be absolutely then it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s good I was just thinking we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re definitely going to have to bring on some other people because I don&amp;#39;t know that we&amp;#39;re going to be that effective just you and I we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re going to need some other value adding folks to to to jump in on the conversation with us yeah yeah we talked about it Sean and you know we&amp;#39;re going to bring in some people who are perhaps experts on clinical trials um adaptive supports um adoptive equipment maybe you know um a lot of different topics I think we&amp;#39;re definitely going to try to um bring in people who know a lot more than you are I do about these all the stuff that we want to talk about for sure I think it&amp;#39;s also it seems to me a perfect and natural time to uh a say welcome again to all of our listeners today and then B invite you to come along for the conversation and get involved you can find us online at to disabled does.com connect with K and I on Facebook or Instagram or whatever platform you enjoy the most and let us know what Kyle and I can bring to the conversation that might be helpful or useful for you if you have questions or thoughts or comments or suggestions or sponsor ideas so we can make millions whatever it may be um we just invite you to to hang out with us and to keep giving us some input to make this better and effective I couldn&amp;#39;t have said it better myself um Sean this has been awesome I&amp;#39;m really excited for the podcast and uh thank you for the conversation today absolutely this is a great one and you know before we sign off there are probably a couple people we want to say thank you to before before we wrap this up what do you think Kyle I think of one lady in particular that really helped us get to where we&amp;#39;re at today and she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s a friend of yours and you brought her to the table so I&amp;#39;ll let you talk about her for a minute yeah Lindsay roor um really helped us put together um the vision for this podcast and really helped us get on track with finding our voice and trying to make sure that this is not our only episode um you know planning for the future and making sure we can um execute into the future so um thank you Lindsay for getting us started yes absolutely thank you Lindsay and then I I don&amp;#39;t know if we&amp;#39;ve mentioned it I guess we haven&amp;#39;t mentioned it before this is episode number one or the introduction to two disabled dudes podcast but Kyle and I have a mutual friend who&amp;#39;s also living with Frederick&amp;#39;s a taxia jake Tomkins is the guy putting the music to the podcast and helping us piece together our phone calls so Jake thank you for your help and what you&amp;#39;re doing to to make this thing work yeah Jake y yay Kyle looking forward what is this every every other week so looking forward to our next conversation and of course looking forward to connecting with others in the community thanks for listening

    "transcript": "morning Dr cor how are you good how are you good thanks for us all right uh so would you like me to start yes please all right so I would be presenting a very particular type of neur degenerative disease known as FX Axia and as uh most of us know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a hereditary condition which is uh which has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and it results from a mutation more specifically from a trinucleotide repeat extension in a gene known as fxn which codes for a mitocondrial protein called f toxin now mutation in this gene causes an impaired mitochondrial function and all the organs that heavily depend on the mitochondria for normal functioning which are the nervous system cells organs and the Heart they would be affected as we would see shortly now a bit about the epidemiology of the disease it&amp;#39;s not very common it&amp;#39;s seen on average in one per 40,000 people and there is no ethnic or gender predilection in the disease so but but it&amp;#39;s like rarely found in subsaharan Africa and lower parts of the China and Japan uh mostly seen in the Caucasian population um so the genetics of the disease are well known it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a gene that&amp;#39;s located on the long arm of chromosome number nine and the mutation that happens is in the first in normally there is this GAA TR nucleotide there that&amp;#39;s repeat that repeats itself around like up to 34 times but in people who have free dry attacks it can repeat up to 1,700 times so it&amp;#39;s like very long repeat in which the transcription post transcription modification of the MRNA gets damaged and it results in lower levels of R toxin than normal but in some rare cases the mutation can also result from a msense mutation in the inance so no trinucleotide repeat extension uh it was shown in 1996 by du R all that uh like in other uh conditions with truclear repeat extension same here uh the more the number of repeats the more severe the disease uh this means that people who had a larger number of TR nucleotide repeat they had the disease usually set on at a younger age and people died at the younger age as well so there&amp;#39;s like a direct correlation between the number of trinucleotide repeats and the severity of the disease same like in Huntington and in other similar conditions um well a bit about the pathogenesis of the disease and how the disease develops um as I mentioned it results in a low levels of FR toxin uh it&amp;#39;s important to point out that it&amp;#39;s not absence of FR toxin it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s low levels because in mine models where froin is completely out the mice couldn&amp;#39;t develop embryonically they would die shortly after implantation so even a small level is required for normal development but uh like normally the F toxin is found in the mitochondria and it&amp;#39;s in close association with iron sulfur complexes so what it does it binds two iron and it stabilizes the iron making it antioxidant uh functions more pronounced and uh it like neutralizes the oxygen there reduces the oygen preventing the oxidative stress so as we would expect with low FR toxin iron would Escape from stabilization and it would predispose the MIT to oxidative stress to the prodction of reactive oxygen species which can damage the mitochondrial membrane and would further lead to apoptosis of the cells and as I mentioned uh since this affects the mitochondria it&amp;#39;s not going to affect all the organs it&amp;#39;s only going to affect the organs that uh depend on the mitochondria for their Norm normal life that&amp;#39;s the nervous system cells and the Heart cells that really require the mitochondria the other cells the other organs they can like live with a lower condition of the toxin they can survive it&amp;#39;s not going to affect them so seriously but the nervous system and the heart are really susceptible to this and this model only like sorry Did anyone say something yeah okay so this this is just the model of pathogenesis this is a hypothesis it&amp;#39;s really hard to prove this scientifically but there is evidence found in urin and in plasma showing high levels of oxidative stress markers and most of the scientists and doctors agree with this model right now I&amp;#39;m not going to go too detailed about the gross pathology of the condition later if one of you guys has a question uh I can show you the pictures in the slides I would just say that we have Legions in the spinal cord in the dorsal root gangon which is responsible for the sensor and and motor difficulties we&amp;#39;ve got lesions in the cerebellum which is responsible for the aack so we&amp;#39;ve got a very shrunken dented nucleus here and we&amp;#39;ve got problems with the heart uh more specifically is that that&amp;#39;s a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy concentric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and one thing that I didn&amp;#39;t mention is that it was uh shown scientifically that mice without froin like with low levels of FR toxin uh they wouldn&amp;#39;t have any beta eyelid cells in their pancreas because for the development for the proper development of beta eyelid cells we require F Toxin and with low levels of protoxin the islands wouldn&amp;#39;t develop properly so the people would be to having diabetes all right uh I want to focus more on the clinical and on the management parts of the condition uh now the age of onset is early relatively early before 25 usually in the mid teens and it&amp;#39;s a slowly Progressive disease it progresses on average in 10 years but there were cases that it took more than 25 years for the disease to progress and like from the time of onset from time of diagnosis to the uh time of wheelchair use it can take up to like 25 years uh so it&amp;#39;s not that fast uh at progression and the death uh is on average uh at 37 years of age and is mostly due to cardiac dysfunction uh around uh two FRS of the cases are due to heart failure and other cases are due to other conditions like diabetes or accidents dur due to the nervous system dysfunction uh a typical P patient looks like this they have skeletal abnormalities they are younger than 25 they&amp;#39;re axic in all limbs they have low they have absent reflexes and they have also signs motor signs because the pyramidal trucks are also affected and uh like everything that I mentioned is just the typical phenotype uh and uh it was demonstrated by Harding dur and dutki like three prominent studies showed that these are like the main conditions are the main symptoms of people with freia we can see that almost all of them had very strong neurological symptoms attack dis arria absent reflexes we see that skeletal abnormalities are also present in many people scoliosis and pesos being the most prominent one they even can present like earlier than neurological symptoms so they can act as like a person positive history that they can show that people can like are prone to having fre ACC we can have this phage and other like Vision disturb distes and most importantly in around two-thirds of the patients we can have cardom myopathy in and in nearly one3 of the patient we see diabetes uh so again this was like the typical uh free Dr and it can also be manifest atypically uh for example the patient that we s together had the latea disease a disease that happens after 25 years of age and it&amp;#39;s usually milder and no myopathy almost never cardiopathy same with another a typical phenotype called Le plasticity with little or no gate and Limp aack as the name suggest there are no like almost no neurological severe symptoms and almost no cardiomyopathy so these are like really mild cases of just people who have the mutation and they don&amp;#39;t have like so severe disease such a severe disease we can have fre Axia with retain reflexes in which people have Axia but they have normal reflexes they have their reflexes preserved and in very rare cases I just found like a couple of case reports showing that free trackx can also mimic hunting with like the corer for movements it can uh be it can present as hunting uh all right the is simple it&amp;#39;s clinical and a genetic testing is required required to demonstrate the truclear repeat extension but uh as again like in rare cases with no trinucleotide repe very small number of trinucleotide repeats we can go with other tests to confirm the diagnosis which are the MRI and additional test like demonstration of f toxin levels we find low level of protoxin then we can uh we can pretty sure know that MRI we see quite uh quite a few things we see a problem with the DED nucleus on the gray matter we see like on the functional M right here you can see lesions on Theus and also see lesions on the white met the tract rising from also find Visions but cere atrophy in the condition actually absence of cere is something that supports electrocardiograph and echocardiography and an Evidence of a neuropathy on nerve conduction studies can also report for the diagnosis of all right uh about the differential diagnosis again I wouldn&amp;#39;t go too detailed about this uh I would just say that there are plenty of few conditions that are hered hereditary and that can present as free Dr A [Music] urodynamic therapies sleep studies so we can manage all the symptoms but we can never prevent the disease from progression uh anyways like uh the good thing about this is that there are there are really promising medications that are currently undergoing clinical trials and it&amp;#39;s uh like hopefully they would show efficiency uh as disease modifying agents right now uh uh most of the studies were focusing on drugs that were against the oxidative stress oxidative damage so basically antioxidants including the over counter antioxidants like vitamin E or coenzyme Q or the drugs mentioned here like ibone or AP 743 these are all drugs that uh are preventing oxidative damage but none of them was found to be more effective and place in clinical trial so they&amp;#39;re not recommended they&amp;#39;re not prescribed usually but what I want to focus on is the drugs that are thought to modify the disease drugs are thought to increase the level of the protein that is missing in the condition uh err a drug transactivator of transcription fxn and interfer and Gamma are all currently being studied they have side effects they are like very good candidates of future treatment this tat fxn drug is actually a very expensive drug that is like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the prot with a small marker on it and it it&amp;#39;s being injected into the cells and it travels into the mitochondria and like resides in the mitochondria increasing the level of froin so possibly modifying the symptoms that result from the absence of the froin and two uh very uh like recent uh medications inhibit Inhibitors of hone de atilas and eam these are two drugs that work on the genes work on the Geno Toxin and possibly revert the silencing of the gene so there trying to like modify the silencing and increase indirectly the levels of retox these are all being studied these are all like these Inhibitors of hison the aad are in the phase two clinical trials right now and they&amp;#39;ve done very good so far and they&amp;#39;re like most lik GNA uh be used as the treatment of the condition soon and I want to focus on the gene therapy as well because I also consider this to be the future of the condition and as like in all other cases with gene therapy here as well we&amp;#39;ve got like uses that have the gene that is missing or mutated and we inject the viruses and they deliver the gene into the nucleus the problem with this is that we have to use herpes not adino virus we have to use herpes simplex virus which have like which have more Affinity to the nervous system C and we have to use like since many cells are affected we have to use a lot of vectors A lot of virus and that can create problems very like uh uh significant side effects and we want to prevent that so a lot of research is being done current on the gene therapy for free dra attack had to possibly find uh ways to incorporate this into the treatment so so far this was it about the disease and if you have any further questions I would love to answer and here are the references if anyone is interested I can send [Music] them",

where friedes attacks you or fa is not an unbeatable foe welcome to that world breaking news after years of Relentless research tireless trials and countless challenges our scientists have finally hit a breakthrough a new treatment for freed Dr sat taxia is here a treatment that promises to change lives to bring hope to bring a chance to fight back stay tuned as we delve deeper into this groundbreaking development but first let&amp;#39;s take a step back and understand what freed sat taxia is all about have you heard about fredri sat taxia or fa for short if not it&amp;#39;s okay it&amp;#39;s a term that&amp;#39;s not common in everyday conversation but for those affected by it it&amp;#39;s a daily reality Freed&amp;#39;s at taxia or fa as we&amp;#39;ll call it from here on out is a rare and Progressive disease it&amp;#39;s a silent enemy that gradually damages the nervous system and causes loss of muscle control over time now you may be wondering what causes this condition well fa is caused by a malfunctioning Gene this Gene known as the fraxin gene or fxn is responsible for the functioning of nerve cells when fxn doesn&amp;#39;t work as it should it can lead to a whole host of problems one of them being fa but how can we know for sure if someone has fa thanks to modern medicine fa can be confirmed through a genetic test that includes a fredri Ataxia repeat expansion analysis this test looks for specific changes in the fxn gene that are indicative of fa as with many Progressive diseases the severity of fa can be measured for fa this is done using the modified freed Dr taxia rating scale or MF fars this scale helps doctors to understand how the disease is progressing and to make informed decisions about treatment living with fa is a journey and for most individuals with this Condition it&amp;#39;s a journey that will eventually lead to the use of a wheelchair typically this happens around 10 to 15 years after being diagnosed enter Sky Claris a Beacon of Hope for those affected by fa this is the first drug specifically designed to treat friedrik at taxia a leap forward in a long and arduous Journey it&amp;#39;s as if we&amp;#39;ve been walking in the dark and suddenly a light has appeared on the horizon Sky Claris is not just another medication it&amp;#39;s a true GameChanger but what makes it so special let&amp;#39;s delve a little deeper its active ingredient works on a molecular level targeting the malfunctioning F taxin Gene the culprit behind fa this Gene when functioning correctly plays a crucial role in the functioning of nerve cells but in FA patients this Gene is out of whack leading to Progressive damage to the nervous system and loss of muscle control Sky Claris enters the scene by focusing on this faulty Gene it doesn&amp;#39;t merely treat the symptoms it goes straight to the root cause this is what sets Sky Claris apart from other treatments it&amp;#39;s like having a specialist locksmith when you&amp;#39;re dealing with a stubborn lock the locksmith doesn&amp;#39;t just oil the lock or attempt to force it open they understand the intricacies of the locks mechanism and work to fix the actual problem let&amp;#39;s be clear though skylaris is not a cure but it&amp;#39;s a significant advancement in managing the symptoms of fa it&amp;#39;s like having a reliable car when you&amp;#39;re on a long and challenging Journey the car might not eliminate the distance you have to travel but it certainly makes the journey more bearable it&amp;#39;s about enhancing the quality of life about giving fa patients a fighting chance against this Relentless disease it&amp;#39;s important to remember that every medication comes with its own set of prerequisites and guidelines Sky Claris is no different before embarking on this treatment Journey it&amp;#39;s crucial to have a clear and open discussion with your healthc care provider about all your medical conditions and current medications although it&amp;#39;s not a cure Sky Claris is a significant step in managing the symptoms of fa it&amp;#39;s the dawn of a new era a time of Hope and possibilities so let&amp;#39;s Embrace this development and continue our journey towards a future where fa is nothing more than a distant memory but who exactly can benefit from Sky Claris let&amp;#39;s Dive Right into that shall we Sky Claris is not a one-size fits-all medication it&amp;#39;s a targeted treatment specifically designed for individuals who are grappling with freed sat taxia a rare and Progressive disease that reeks havoc on the nervous system and grad ually erodes muscle control so the first and foremost requirement for eligibility is a confirmed diagnosis of Freed&amp;#39;s Ataxia this confirmation typically comes through a genetic test such as the fredri Ataxia repeat expansion analysis now just because someone has fredri at taxia doesn&amp;#39;t automatically make them eligible there are other factors to consider and this is where the role of healthc care providers becomes so crucial they need to evaluate the patient&amp;#39;s overall health status status the severity of their FA measured using the modified freed Dr taxia rating scale or M fars and the potential risks and benefits of starting the treatment remember Sky Claris is a powerful medication and like all powerful medications it needs to be handled with care each individual&amp;#39;s body is unique and what works for one person may not necessarily work for another certain medical conditions or medications could interact with Sky Claris potentially leading to adverse effects so before starting Sky Claris it&amp;#39;s essential to have a comprehensive discussion with your healthc care provider be open about your medical history current health status and any medications or supplements you&amp;#39;re currently taking your healthc care provider can then make an informed decision about whether Sky Claris is the right choice for you or not in conclusion while Sky Claris is a Beacon of Hope for those battling freed Dres of taxia it&amp;#39;s not a decision to be made lightly or without professional guidance remember it&amp;#39;s crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions and medications before taking Sky Claris so what are the benefits of Sky Claris you may ask well let&amp;#39;s delve into that Sky Claris is the first drug made specifically for the treatment of friedes sat taxia it&amp;#39;s a groundbreaking achievement a Beacon of Hope for those living with fa it&amp;#39;s not a cure but it&amp;#39;s a significant step towards managing this challenging disease the active ingredient in Sky Claris is designed to Target the malfunctioning PR taxin Gene which is the root cause of fa by addressing the root cause Sky Claris helps to slow down the progression of the disease this means that the loss of muscle control a key symptom of fa can be managed better but the benefits of Sky Claris go beyond just managing the symptoms it&amp;#39;s about improving the quality of life it&amp;#39;s about giving back some level of Independence about making the everyday activities a bit easier think about it the ability to do simple tasks like holding a cup of coffee or brushing your teeth without assistance can make a world of difference to someone living with fa moreover Sky Claris can potentially delay the need for a wheelchair a reality that most individuals with fa face about 10 to 15 years after diagnosis every additional year of mobility of being able to move around on your own is a year gained in the battle against fa and then there&amp;#39;s the psychological aspect living with a progressive disease can be mentally challenging the knowledge that there&amp;#39;s a medication specifically designed to manage your condition can provide a psychological boost a sense of hope and hope my friends can be a powerful medicine in itself however it&amp;#39;s important to remember that every individual is unique and so is their response to medication what works for one may not work for the other therefore the suitability of Sky Claris should always be discussed with a healthc care provider Sky Claris while not a cure can make a significant difference in the lives of those living with fa it&amp;#39;s about managing the disease improving the quality of life and fostering hope and sometimes that&amp;#39;s all we need to keep going like any medication Sky Claris comes with potential side effects it&amp;#39;s crucial to be aware of these so you can monitor your health while on the treatment and ensure you&amp;#39;re making the most informed decisions about your care firstly Sky Claris can cause increased liver enzymes this might not cause any symptoms but it can be detected through blood tests so regular checkups with your doctor are essential to keep an eye on this the next potential side effect is headaches these can range from mild to severe and while they may be a common part of life for many of us if you notice a significant increase after starting Sky Claris it&amp;#39;s definitely something to discuss with your doctor nausea and stomach pain are also potential side effects of Sky Claris these can be particularly uncomfortable but there are often strategies and additional medications that can help manage these symptoms tiredness is another side effect to look out for it&amp;#39;s not just the ordinary end of the day fatigue it&amp;#39;s a more profound feeling of exhaustion that doesn&amp;#39;t improve with rest diarrhea can also occur with Sky Claris while it can be inconvenient it&amp;#39;s crucial to stay hydrated If you experience this side effect lastly muscle pain is a potential side effect this isn&amp;#39;t the good type of ache you get after a workout but rather a persistent discomfort that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to go away these are the known potential side effects but as Sky Claris is a relatively new drug there could be others yet to be discovered this isn&amp;#39;t to scare you but to keep you informed everyone&amp;#39;s body reacts differently to medications and it&amp;#39;s possible that you may experience side effects not listed here it&amp;#39;s important to report any side effects to your doctor promptly they can help manage these side effects or adjust the treatment plan if necessary remember your health and well-being are the top priority as we wrap up let&amp;#39;s summarize what we&amp;#39;ve learned today we&amp;#39;ve dived deep into the world of freed drk ATT Taxi or fa a rare and Progressive disease that damages the nervous system resulting in loss of muscle control over time this condition is caused by a malfunctioning frat taxin Gene that affects the functioning of nerve cells a fact that can be confirmed through a genetic test known as fredri at taxia repeat expansion analysis we then explored the long arduous Journey scientists and researchers have embarked on to find a cure for this debilitating condition although a definitive cure remains elusive their tireless efforts have resulted in the development of a promising treatment Sky Claris we learned that Sky Claris is the first drug engineered specifically for the treatment of fa it&amp;#39;s a unique medical breakthrough but like any medication it&amp;#39;s not for everyone there are certain qualifications that one must meet to be eligible for this drug and it&amp;#39;s crucial to discuss its suitability with a healthc care provider we also looked at the benefits that Sky Claris offers while it may not be a cure it has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for those living living with fa however it&amp;#39;s essential to keep in mind that every medication has potential side effects with Sky Claris these could include increased liver enzymes headaches nausea stomach pain fatigue diarrhea and muscle pain it&amp;#39;s of utmost importance to inform your healthcare provider about all medical conditions and medications before starting Sky Claris any side effects should be reported promptly and certain precautions should be taken while on this medication we hope this overview has given you a clearer understanding of fa and the role of Sky Claris in managing this condition remember knowledge is power the more we know and understand about fa the better prepared we are to support those affected by it and advocate for continued research and development in this field thank you for joining us on this journey to understand fa and Sky Claris better please share this video with anyone you feel May benefit from this information until next time take care",

    "transcript": "imagine a condition so rare it only affects one in every 50,000 people on Earth welcome to the complex world of friedes ATT taxia or as those familiar with it call it fa in the expansive spectrum of human conditions and diseases fried&amp;#39;s Ataxia also referred to as fa sets itself apart due to its distinctiveness and Rarity pronounced as fried&amp;#39;s utu its name can be quite a mouthful some people even prefer the French pronunciation Fredick but for the sake of simplicity and as those who are familiar with it usually do we&amp;#39;ll refer to it as fa for more information on the pronunciation and the scientists who discovered fa check the description below fa is an intricate poorly understood disease that has been the subject of extensive medical research yet despite the best efforts of the scientific Community a cure remains elusive it&amp;#39;s a genetic disorder passed down through families with a level unpredictability that would make even the most seasoned Gambler pause it&amp;#39;s a condition that poses a unique set of challenges its Rarity means that many people are unfamiliar with it and its effects are often misunderstood it&amp;#39;s an invisible battle that with fa and their families face day in day out fa isn&amp;#39;t contagious it&amp;#39;s not something you can contract or develop from poor lifestyle choices it&amp;#39;s a role of the genetic dice a game of chance that commences before you&amp;#39;re even born The Inheritance pattern of fa can be demonstrated using a punet square a basic tool for understanding how traits are passed from parents to children the symptoms of fa are as varied as the people it affects they can range from mild to severe and no two individuals with fa experience it in the same way treatment plans are equally varied and are often customade for the individual specific symptoms and needs but let&amp;#39;s not rush we&amp;#39;re just beginning to unravel the mystery of fa and there&amp;#39;s much more to explore now that we&amp;#39;ve laid the foundation let&amp;#39;s delve deeper into to the intricate web of fa fa doesn&amp;#39;t just happen it&amp;#39;s a tale of inheritance a story written in the language of our genes our genes those tiny packets of information that Define us are passed down from generation to generation carrying with them potential for many things including fa now let&amp;#39;s replace that complex punet Square explanation from your high school biology class with a much simpler analogy think of inheritance like a pair of shoes each parent contributes shoe to the pair and these shoes can either be a right shoe or a left shoe in the world of fa the gene in question is like a left shoe this means that a person needs to inherit two left shoes one from each parent to develop the condition if they only inherit one left shoe they become a carrier able to pass on the left shoe but they won&amp;#39;t develop fa if both parents contribute a left shoe then the child has fa the odds can seem daunting but remember this is a simplified version of an incredibly complex process our are not Destiny set in stone they&amp;#39;re more like a set of possibilities it&amp;#39;s also important to note that fa is quite rare in fact it&amp;#39;s estimated that only one in every 50,000 people worldwide have it in the end it&amp;#39;s all about chance the role of genetic dice that determines who gets what from the genetic pool it&amp;#39;s a game of chance a genetic Lottery where not everyone holds a winning ticket some may find themselves holding the fa card a piece of their story they never asked for but must carry none less so it&amp;#39;s all a game of chance a genetic Lottery where not everyone holds a winning ticket fa is a Master of Disguise hiding behind symptoms that may seem common at first glance like a chameleon blending into its surroundings the signs of fa can be subtle and often they&amp;#39;re mistaken for something else entirely imagine a storm on the horizon at first it starts as a slight drizzle barely noticeable but slowly it intensifies the clouds darken the winds pick up and it becomes a tempest this is what living with fa is like one of the earliest symptoms of fa is difficulty with balance and coordination often referred to as a taxia it&amp;#39;s as if the person is walking on a tight RPP that only they can see but this isn&amp;#39;t just a case of the usual clumsiness it&amp;#39;s a distinct Progressive decline in physical coordination that can affect walking speech and even the ability to swallow another symptom is fatigue not just the kind of tiredness that comes from a long day but an inexplicable exhaust that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to go away with rest this is due to the heartwork overtime as fa often causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy a condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick now imagine your hands and feet feeling like they&amp;#39;re perpetually asleep with that tingling numbness we&amp;#39;ve all experienced at one time or another this is neuropathy another common symptom of fa it can also cause muscle weakness and loss of reflexes especially in the lower extremities fa can also lead to changes in vision and hearing as well as slurred speech making communication a challenge and as if all that wasn&amp;#39;t enough it can also cause diabetes and curvature of the spine or scoliosis it&amp;#39;s important to remember that these symptoms don&amp;#39;t occur in isolation but rather they form a complex web that impacts every aspect of a person&amp;#39;s life just like the storm that starts subtly almost imperceptibly before gradually becoming a tempest the symptoms of fa become progressively more pronounced over time but here&amp;#39;s the thing recognizing these symptoms early on can make a world of difference it can lead to a diagnosis and while there&amp;#39;s no known cure for fa yet there are ways to manage the symptoms and improve quality of life fa might be a crafty opponent but knowing its tactics is the first step towards fighting back so let&amp;#39;s not let this Master of Disguise fool us let&amp;#39;s arm ourselves with knowledge and face this storm headon because in this battle awareness is our strongest weapon to help with this a video of a taxia is available and can be found in the description below let&amp;#39;s take a closer look at the symptoms of fa one by one first let&amp;#39;s discuss a taxia the Traer of balance and coordination this is often the first sign of fa and can make simple tasks like walking or holding an object a challenge it&amp;#39;s like a tight RPP Walker suddenly finding the Rope under their feet swaying unpredictably imagine that and you&amp;#39;ll understand a little about what living with a taxia is like next we have fatigue a thief that robs you of your energy without any apparent reason this is not your usual tiredness after a long day of work or a strenuous workout it&amp;#39;s a bone deep exhaustion that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to go away with rest then there&amp;#39;s hypertrophic cardiomyopathy a serious heart condition that often accompanies fa it&amp;#39;s like having a drummer in your chest who doesn&amp;#39;t know when to stop causing your heart to work over time this can lead to a host of other issues like fatigue and shortness of breath neuropathy another symptom of fa can be likened to to an unwanted guest that overstays its welcome it&amp;#39;s a nerve damage that can cause a range of symptoms from numbness to pain making your own body feel alien to you muscle weakness is another Hallmark of fa making everyday tasks more difficult it&amp;#39;s like carrying a heavy weight all the time even when you&amp;#39;re just trying to lift a cup of coffee or write a simple note finally the loss of reflexes can affect a person&amp;#39;s ability to respond quickly to physical stimuli it&amp;#39;s like living in a world where everything moves in slow motion except for you understanding these symptoms in detail can help us better manage fa it&amp;#39;s like knowing your enemy strategy before going into battle the more we know the better we can fight so let&amp;#39;s keep learning let&amp;#39;s keep fighting and let&amp;#39;s keep hoping for a future where fa is nothing more than a distant memory continuing our Deep dive into the symptoms of fa let&amp;#39;s shed light on some other aspects that might not be as commonly discussed but are equally important speech problems often occur in people with f making it difficult for them to articulate their thoughts clearly it&amp;#39;s like trying to sing a song with the music constantly changing Tempo you&amp;#39;re not losing your words but the rhythm of speech is disrupted then we have hearing loss this isn&amp;#39;t the common age related hearing loss with fa it&amp;#39;s like someone is gradually turning down the volume of life&amp;#39;s soundtrack vision loss is another symptom that can be associated with fa it&amp;#39;s akin to looking at the world through a frosted glass window blurring the beauty of life&amp;#39;s details scoliosis a curvature of the spine can also occur in people with fa it&amp;#39;s like carrying a heavy backpack on one shoulder for too long causing your body to lean to one side diabetes is another condition that some people with fa may develop it&amp;#39;s like having a sweet tooth but your body can&amp;#39;t handle the sugar lastly heart disease is a common problem for many people with fa we&amp;#39;ve talked about hypertrophic cardiomyopathy earlier but there are other heart related issues that can arise as well it&amp;#39;s like having a car with a faulty engine making the Journey of life more challenging these symptoms can be challenging but understanding them is the first step towards managing them let&amp;#39;s remember that knowledge is power and the more we know about fa the better equipped we are to manage it while fa might not have a known cure yet it doesn&amp;#39;t mean the Battle Is Lost there&amp;#39;s more than one way to fight treating fa is not about finding a Magic Bullet but rather it&amp;#39;s about managing the symptoms and improving the quality of life for those living with fa each person&amp;#39;s reaction to treatment can vary as fa is as unique as the individuals it affects a common approach to treatment is through Physical Therapy the goal of physical therapy is to help maintain mobility and coordination manage muscle stiffness and address any difficulties with balance it&amp;#39;s a proactive way to combat some of the physical challenges brought on by fa additionally speech therapy can be beneficial for those experiencing speech and swallowing difficulties it&amp;#39;s a tool that helps individuals communicate more effectively and enjoy their meals without fear of choking medications also play a role in managing fa certain drugs can help alleviate symptoms like heart problems diabetes and muscle stiffness these medications are not cures but they can make living with fa more manageable in some cases surgical interventions might be considered for example a procedure called spinal fusion can help those those with severe curvature of the spine a common complication of fa on the Forefront of fa treatment is gene therapy while still in the experimental stages this promising Avenue of research aims to correct the genetic mutation that causes fa it&amp;#39;s a Beacon of Hope in the fight against this condition but remember treating fa isn&amp;#39;t just about medical interventions it&amp;#39;s also about living a healthy lifestyle regular exercise a balanced diet and plenty of rest can go a long way in managing symptoms and maintaining overall health it&amp;#39;s important to note that each individual&amp;#39;s Journey with fa is distinct what works for one person may not work for the next that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s crucial to work with a team of healthc Care Professionals who can guide and support you through your unique Journey every person&amp;#39;s Journey with fa is unique but no one has to walk that path alone your strength and resilience in the face of fa are truly inspiring and remember every step forward no matter how small is a victory in the fight against fa living with fa isn&amp;#39;t just about symptoms and treatments it&amp;#39;s a part of who a person is shaping their life in ways others might not understand imagine waking up each day knowing that your body might not cooperate in the way you&amp;#39;d like it to the simple tasks that many take for granted like walking writing or even speaking become challenges to overcome but with every challenge comes an opportunity for victory and that&amp;#39;s the reality of living with friedrik at taxia or fa for you you see fa is a rare inherited disease that affects the nervous system causing difficulty with movement and coordination it&amp;#39;s like trying to conduct a symphony but the musicians can&amp;#39;t quite play in harmony now that doesn&amp;#39;t sound like a walk in the park does it yet those living with fa face this Symphony every day conducting their bodies with Grace and determination but it&amp;#39;s not all about the struggles living with fa also means celebrating the small victories maybe it&amp;#39;s managing to tie a shoelace uned or successfully cooking a meal perhaps it&amp;#39;s being able to take a few steps without stumbling or even uttering a sentence without slurring these might seem insignificant to some but for someone with fa they are Monumental achievements moreover fa isn&amp;#39;t a one- siiz fits-all condition it affects people differently just as it weaves into the fabric of their lives in different ways some might need a walking Aid others might use a wheelchair some might have difficulty speaking others might struggle with hearing but despite these differences One Thing Remains the Same the spirit of resilience people with fa are not just surviving they&amp;#39;re thriving they&amp;#39;re pushing boundaries breaking stereotypes and showing the world that their condition doesn&amp;#39;t Define them they are students professionals artists athletes and so much more they are individuals with dreams aspirations and a zest for life that&amp;#39;s as strong as anyone else&amp;#39;s might be a part of their story but it doesn&amp;#39;t Define them they are defined by their courage their strength and their unyielding determination to live life to the fullest regardless of the challenges that come their way fa might seem like a formidable opponent but every day we&amp;#39;re making strides towards understanding it better the world of Medical Science is vast full of Brilliant Minds who dedicate their lives to unraveling the mysteries of conditions like fried&amp;#39;s at taxia and it&amp;#39;s in this world that hope for a better tomorrow blooms there&amp;#39;s a tremendous amount of ongoing research in the quest to understand fa better scientists are working tirelessly to explore the genetic roots of this condition to understand its intricacies and to unlock the secrets that it holds they&amp;#39;re diving deep into the human genome hunting for Clues and piecing together the puzzle that is fa and it&amp;#39;s not just about understanding fa it&amp;#39;s about finding better ways to manage it to treat it and ultimately to cure it clinical trials are underway testing new drugs and therapies that could potentially slow halt or even reverse the progression of fa the results are promising and every Discovery brings us one step closer to a breakthrough it&amp;#39;s a journey a long and challenging one but a journey that we&amp;#39;re committed to we&amp;#39;re pushing the boundaries of what we know venturing into the unknown propelled by a single unyielding purpose to give those living with fa a better tomorrow and while we&amp;#39;re still in the thick of this journey there&amp;#39;s something important to remember hope is not just found in the promise of tomorrow it&amp;#39;s also found in the here and now it&amp;#39;s in the strength and resilience of those living with fa in their courage and determination in their unwillingness to let fa Define them so yes fa is a formidable opponent but it&amp;#39;s one we&amp;#39;re learning to understand one we&amp;#39;re learning to fight and it&amp;#39;s in this fight this pursuit of knowledge and understanding that we find hope hope for better treatments hope for a cure and most importantly hope for a brighter healthier tomorrow for all those living with fa fa is a challenge but it&amp;#39;s a challenge we&amp;#39;re ready to take on we&amp;#39;ve journeyed through the world of fa together understanding its Origins recognizing its signs and exploring the ways to fight it we&amp;#39;ve delved into the complexities of fredri sat taxia or as we&amp;#39;ve come to know it fa we&amp;#39;ve understood that it&amp;#39;s a rare inherited disease one that comes with no known cure yet we&amp;#39;ve also seen the resilience of those who live with it and the mer ways they manage their symptoms we&amp;#39;ve examined the punet square understanding the genetic Lottery that brings fa into someone&amp;#39;s life we&amp;#39;ve learned about the symptoms that signal its presence and the treatments that while not curing help manage this condition we&amp;#39;ve seen the reality of living with fa and the hope that tomorrow brings remember each one of us possesses a strength that sometimes we ourselves underestimate fa may be rare but awareness shouldn&amp;#39;t be together we can make a difference don&amp;#39;t forget to check out the links in the description for more details

    "transcript": "friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia is a disorder where there&amp;#39;s impaired mitochondrial function that results in damage to various organ systems in particular the nervous system gets damaged which causes ataxia where the muscles cannot be moved in a coordinated way the disorder also affects other organs like the heart and pancreas the disease gets its name from the german physician nicolaus friedrich who first described the disease over 150 years so normally on chromosome 9 there&amp;#39;s a gene called the fxn gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein called frataxin the normal amount of frataxin varies by tissue with some tissues like the nervous system pancreas and heart containing lots of it frataxin helps put together cofactors called iron sulfur clusters it is a combination of iron and sulfur that form part of enzymes with many functions such as electron transfer which is a key part of mitochondrial atp production friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is caused by a mutation in the fxn gene where there&amp;#39;s an abnormal repetition of a gaa sequence within that gene this is called a triplet repeat or trinucleotide repeat which means that a group of three dna nucleotides is repeated multiple times in a row in this case guanine adenine and adenine normally the gaa sequence is repeated 7 to 34 times within the fxn gene but in friedrichs ataxia there is a repeat expansion where there are 100 to 1 700 times as many copies with most individuals having repeats ranging from 600 to 1200 times now friedrichs ataxia is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition it&amp;#39;s passed on by parents who are carriers because they have one expanded fxn gene and one normal fxn gene but they don&amp;#39;t have any symptoms of friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia they end up passing on their expanded fxn genes to their kid inheriting both copies of the fxn gene with an expanded gaa repeat is the most common way to get friedrichs ataxia the repeat expansion causes gene silencing which is when the fxn gene is not transcribed normally and very little frataxin protein is made with low levels of frataxin the mitochondria are unable to efficiently incorporate iron into iron sulfur clusters and as a result there is lower mitochondrial atp production so there&amp;#39;s less energy available for the cell furthermore iron accumulates inside the mitochondria which reacts with oxygen to create unstable oxygen radicals over time these free radicals damage dna and proteins in the cells in a process called oxidative damage then this energy deficiency and oxidative damage result in dysfunction and death of the cells that are highly dependent on mitochondrial function such as neurons cardiomyocytes and pancreatic beta cells the loss of neurons leads to ataxia the ataxia usually begins in childhood which causes them to have difficulty in walking they might have some muscle weakness and loss of proprioception which is the sense of your position in space relative to other objects usually it affects the legs and then moves up to the torso a generalized feeling of fatigue is also common eventually most people with friedrichs ataxia need a wheelchair to get around the diagnosis of friedrichs ataxia is established by genetic testing this test is used to identify the expanded gaa repeat in both copies of the fxn gene the most common cause of friedrichs ataxia additional tests may be performed to help determine the extent of the disease such as an mri of the brain and spinal cord",

    "transcript": "hello everyone and welcome to part three of growing up with e if you don&amp;#39;t know what fa is it stands for fraia it&amp;#39;s a very rare neurom mascular disability and I was diagnosed when I was 10 years old now I&amp;#39;m 23 and it is Progressive so as I was growing up I continued to get more and more physically disabled and that&amp;#39;s what this whole story is about my experience with all of that and this video is going to be about high school I started Golf in 9th grade at 14 years old first of all it&amp;#39;s was very weird my high school we had a separate Ninth Grade Campus and then we had our 10th through 12 so in ninth grade I was on a campus with all the other ninth graders and at the time I was still walking even though I probably shouldn&amp;#39;t have been or I should have been using a walker or something but my stubborn teenage brain they not want to be any more different than they already was so I kept vlogging and try to be as normal as I could be and I struggled a lot with walking I also at that a how to start having an aid with me I did not want one I did not want n but the school made me have one so I had to be that girl with someone following me around all the time the reason I had a was to take notes for me and help me take tests and just help me keep up my classes which I love my Aid and I am very glad I have one now at the time though it was I did not want to have someone following me around and blah blah blah so because of that it was hard to like maintain friendship and there was some people who understood that I was disabled so I did still have a few friends but being in school and walking and everything all of the physical effects of me started to get a lot worse and stared to really take a toll on me and because I was walking was also falling a lot and getting hurt a lot and it was just physically exhausting so that&amp;#39;s all I really remember about 9th grade is going to school trying to walk and not fall constantly cuz it was so embarrassing and I would leave school go home and just be exhausted and then nth grade and then and during this summer between 9th and 10th grade I had to have surgery on my fine to correct my scoliosis which is another side effect of fa that summer when I was 15 I had spine surgery and it was the hardest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever been through the most painful thing I&amp;#39;ve ever been through after that I started using a wer not because of the surgery just because my fa had progressed that much I probably should have been using will sh before that but I was too stupid so finally after I had surgery I was like I don&amp;#39;t want to fall anymore I in enough pain with this surgery I&amp;#39;ll just I&amp;#39;ll use the wheelchair so I showed up my 10th grade year in a witer and my social life finished I immediately lost all my friends and disabled it was obvious and I was 15 16 years old and when you&amp;#39;re that [Music] different in high school it&amp;#39;s just impossible so yeah I didn&amp;#39;t have any friends I didn&amp;#39;t have any social life I just went to school for school get my work then what I had to do and then I went on I did not enjoy it I didn&amp;#39;t want to be there but I had to be so I showed up did my school work and went home most days didn&amp;#39;t talk to anyone besides my teacher and my Aid I didn&amp;#39;t really do anything I wasn&amp;#39;t in any club I was as antisocial as the gift also in high school I started well actually I started in middle school and went one clinical study in Minnesota travel there from Louisiana and then when I was in high school I started going to more clinical trials I went all over the country I went to Minnesota New York Florida I was nonstop tra that was kind of my social life I guess um was traveling going to clinical trials and studies for a f so most of my high school years were going to school not talking to anyone and then when I wasn&amp;#39;t in school school I was traveling going to doctors they were doing test or I was taking experimental drugs and constantly doing test yeah all I remember from high school is school and clinical trials and no no friends and then I finally graduated high school in 200 18 my graduation was actually kind of cool after being in a wheelchair for 3 years at that point I was still able to walk a little bit with a lot of assistant so I surprised everyone and I walked across the stage at my graduation and I kind of copi my older brother because he did the same thing five years prior but I had a one of him and I surprised everyone um so no one was happening I had even like made my mom go shopping for high heels I obviously had no balance and if I was wearing ey heels there was no chance I could walk but I was in a wheelchair so I was like I need new for my graduation and I wor weapon I brought a backup pair of like sneakers so it was a total surprise and I walked across the stage with assistance I had two people helping me and holding me up and I walked across stage AG got my diploma and finally high school was over so that&amp;#39;s what it was like for me growing up with a b and going to school and all of that I had all the normal pressures of being a teenager and going through school with my disability on top of that any teenager who&amp;#39;s disabled and watching this video what I want you to take away is be confident and be your disbled self because it&amp;#39;s okay to be different and it&amp;#39;s honestly better to be different I don&amp;#39;t want to be like everyone else I want to stand out so thank you for watching and I hope you enjoyed it if you want to hear about my college life and my adult life CU I am 23 almost 24 so it&amp;#39;s been almost six years let me know in the comments I can make a video or you can follow me on my Tik Tok my Instagram my Facebook any of those and keep up with what I&amp;#39;m doing in my life now but

    "transcript": "[Applause] and I hello everyone my name is Sydney which you probably know if you&amp;#39;re watching but if you don&amp;#39;t hi I&amp;#39;m Sydney and I have a disability called fre Taxi or fa for sure and if you don&amp;#39;t know what fa is it&amp;#39;s a very rare neuromuscular disability it is genetic and it affects all of your muscles and all of the nerves in your body and it&amp;#39;s Progressive so getes worse over time I&amp;#39;ll get more in detail about fa if you want that video let me know or comment questions um also you can follow me on my other social medias I talk a lot about what I F is on my Tik toks and my Instagram so check those out but this video is about what it was like for me to grow up with fa I was diagnosed when I was 10 years old so I&amp;#39;ve had fa for nearly 14 years now and it was [Music] very interesting growing up and I get a lot of questions about it so I thought I would tell you pretty much my whole life story growing up with fa my story starts when I was 5 years old my older brother was diagnosed with f and he was 10 years old like was 5 years older than me and he was diagnosed and because fa is a genetic disability we always knew that there is a possibility that I would also have a and 5 years later I ended up also being diagnosed with f but even though I was saying knows when I was saying that is not when the started affecting my life I&amp;#39;ve always had issues physically because of a even though I wasn&amp;#39;t diagnosed until was 10 I definitely noticed the effects for as long as I can remember but I&amp;#39;m going to say starting at 6 years old um that&amp;#39;s kind of when I remember things starting to happen so I was in first Gren my older brother was diagnosed and I was not diagnos yet and we didn&amp;#39;t know if I had a thing but personally I started noticing things like in school and I played a lot of sports when I was younger like sofball soccer basketball I did trle and when I was doing those things I could always tell that one it wasn&amp;#39;t very good at them and it wasn&amp;#39;t that I just wasn&amp;#39;t good it wasn&amp;#39;t I wasn&amp;#39;t coordinated and I couldn&amp;#39;t keep up with running and things like that even in first grade when I was 6 years old I remember going to PE and sometimes we would have have to run laps like do two or three laps around the playground or whatever and even then I remember I cannot keep up I was always dead blast I was always struggling to keep up with running and I remember people people would kind of ask me like hey why are you going so slow why can&amp;#39;t you keep up I didn&amp;#39;t really understand what fa was at that age but I knew something was not right with me and I knew that my older brother was diagnosed with with something so a little SE me would tell people oh I have this problem like my older brother does and I didn&amp;#39;t know what I was talking about but I knew there was something that kind of continued throughout Elementary School throughout first second and third up until I was like8 or 9 years old and then things kind of started getting worse uh one major thing was my handwriting in school it was very hard to like take notes and keep up and when you&amp;#39;re when I was in Elementary School we would have like spelling tests where you had a certain amount of time so like spell out your words and I always had trouble even though I knew how to spell them I was I was a very smart kid and I knew how but I couldn&amp;#39;t write the words fast enough so that was happening and then also my handwriting in general was just very bad and sloppy and not not good and in my Elementary School first second and everything under that pre kindergarten all of those grades had classes downstairs and then upstairs were all of the third fourth and fifth grade classes so when I got into third grade and my class was upstairs I immediately noticed that I had a lot of trouble using the stairs I was always very slow going up and down the stairs I was the last one every time and it was even kind of dangerous because I started falling a lot just from having aafe and being uncoordinated ated and clumsy and I would get like out of breth from you know all of the heart conditions that if causes it was dangerous to have me stumbling around the stairs so I started using the elevator and I still was not diagnosed when I was using the elevator and I would get extra time and my teachers kind of knew that something was off but I was not diagnosed yet my parents I don&amp;#39;t know if they were kind of in denial or just didn&amp;#39;t see it or didn&amp;#39;t want to see it so that continued on for two more years and it wasn&amp;#39;t until I was in fifth grade and I was 10 years old and my mom was a teacher at my elementary school she was never my teacher but she weren&amp;#39;t at the school and all of my teachers were telling her like something is going on you know she&amp;#39;s not keeping up in class with her notes and her handwriting even though I was like very smart and I knew everything that I I was supposed to I just couldn&amp;#39;t keep up with writing it and everyone can tell in PE that I was not keeping up with the physical activities and it finally got to a point where one of my mom&amp;#39;s friends who was also a teacher had I kind of sit my mom down and me like hey there&amp;#39;s something going on with Sydney and you need to get her tested it&amp;#39;s very possible that she might also have a because f is genetic and my older brother was there know with fa we kind of already knew that it was probably fa so I immediately got tested specifically for a thing from what I remember I did um a couple of neres T like little things where they would shock my legs and like see how my nerves are respond or like they would stick me with needles and see how I responded blah blah blah and then they would watch me walk and then after all of that they were like yes something is definitely off and and that was when I did a blood test for day and I was diagnosed December 23rd of 2010 when I was 10 years old so mared Chas to me I had a thing and it was already kind of known by everyone that I had but we finally got got a diagnosis and with doing the diagnosis it also kind of saved my life because when we were doing the testing for they and kind of also noticed that at that time I was losing a lot of weight and I was really skinny but everyone just thought and assume hey she&amp;#39;s 10 years old she is growing and going through pu and a grocy that&amp;#39;s probably you know why she&amp;#39;s using my blah blah blah Well turns so that was not all that was happening and when I got diagnosed with fa we also learned that I had another issue and I was diagnosed with grapes disease which is a th disease and I was told that if we had not caught that and didn&amp;#39;t start training it I would have been dead in a few months from Mal nutrition because I had hyper thyroidism and my metabolism was going too fast and my body could not keep up so I was just like losing way too much weight and once I got diagnosed with that even though I was diagnosed with fa fa we knew had no cure no treatment at the time so that was kind of put on the back burner and all of a sudden we had a start training this grave series and I was going to all kind of specialist and I was put on a medication to slow down my metabolism and literally I was the one to start eating as much as I possibly could and eat ice cream with every meal was to my 10/1 old self that was like amazing I was like yeah I get to like eat a ton of food and a lot of ice cream and all of this so I started doing all of that to gain the weight back while I was on this medication to help my thyroid and slow down my metabolism so that I could gain the weight back cuz I was very underweight and even got to a point where in school I would have to like leave class and like eat something and it caused a lot of other issues as well like the medication because it slowed down my metabolism and made me very very tired so I would literally in the middle of the day and fif grade have to leave my class and go sleep and take a nap and the principal&amp;#39;s office once I started that medication at 11 years old I was told that I had about 2 years before the side effects of that thyroid medication got too severe and after about 2 years I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to continue taking the medicine and I would eventually have to remove my thyroid by ration or having it surgically removed when me and my parents we didn&amp;#39;t really know which one I wanted to do there were obviously risk and complications with both all of this was happening on top of my struggles with a V and the reason I&amp;#39;m telling you all of this is because we thought at the time that it wasn&amp;#39;t until a few years ago that ever more research being done with a it was I guess found out and there was an article released that if a mainly women caused a lot of issues with hormones and Metabolism especially when you&amp;#39;re growing up and going to puberty and all of that so I was dealing with all of that and then 2 years later I stop taking the medication I was getting ready to either have the surgery or the radiation to remove my thyroid and I stopped the medicine and I did not get worse um I was 13 and I am like kind of stop that gross that I was going through and suddenly I was in remission and they called it Medical miracle that all of a sudden I did not have gra disease anymore now we know that that was because it was not graes disase it was most [Music] likely a side effect of having nothing so that happen in elementary school and then I had the transition into middle school or Junior High whatever you want to call it and if you want to hear about my teenage years going through fa that will be in part two of this this video this was part one of my childhood with E and let me know if you guys enjoyed it if you have any questions that I didn&amp;#39;t cover please comment them and I will do my best answer when I can or follow my Tik Tok or my Instagram or Facebook and I answer a lot of questions on there make sure you much for you who learn all about my life as a teenager with the van hi",

Frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia we don&amp;#39;t know much about it we&amp;#39;re making this to help Enlighten some of our friends some of our families and also for anyone else who may have a child in this situation we&amp;#39;ve been told that having a six-year-old being diagnosed with this is extremely rare and I continue it&amp;#39;s extremely difficult because of the unknowns there are a lot of unknowns a lot of questions a lot of what ifs and frankly we feel like we don&amp;#39;t have many answers to that so we feel as if we document our journey a little bit it may help some of the other people out there along your Journeys with your families it may bring you some peace and we&amp;#39;ve so far been unable to capture for our own selves um I&amp;#39;ll start by telling Gunner&amp;#39;s story when he was in I guess got her story leading to the diagnosis when he was in pre-k his teacher brought it to my attention that he had a nervous shake when he went to cut paper as a mom you don&amp;#39;t really think much about it you think they&amp;#39;re developing hand-eye coordination you think they&amp;#39;re just learning how to cut they&amp;#39;re learning how to write this is all what this is for so I just kind of let it slide this past year Gunner was in kindergarten and his teacher brought it to my attention again so I kind of thought okay if two teachers are bringing it to my attention it&amp;#39;s a little bit more than hand-eye coordination Goddard has always had allergy problems sinus problems we&amp;#39;ve had tubes his adenoids have been removed he is congested three weeks out of the month it&amp;#39;s a constant nose pour I always thought okay he&amp;#39;s unbalanced because of all the issues with his sinus and allergy and things like that well after the kindergarten teacher brought it to our attention we decided that it would be best to contact his pediatrician and see you know what she thought about it so we went to the pediatrician she you know we love her to death she&amp;#39;s a great person great doctor she&amp;#39;s always put Gunner first um and she did exactly what we asked her to we got it she got us an appointment with a neurologist um we went to the neurologist in December of 22. and he did some testing on Gunner just basic watching him walk watching him run right things like that and um we weren&amp;#39;t really given any potential prognosis of what it might be they wanted us to do a DNA kit because they frankly didn&amp;#39;t have an idea whatsoever per the conversation we had when we were there well in all honesty they didn&amp;#39;t really lead on that anything could be wrong it was more like it&amp;#39;s okay we&amp;#39;re just gonna check just you know for the fun of it and I guess about a month later we were home that day from school and the nurse called and said that the doctor would like for us to come in to discuss the test results and you know your first instinct is to ask is everything okay and you know they&amp;#39;re going to tell you they can&amp;#39;t tell you that it&amp;#39;s not okay or if it is okay and the scheduling was just off we couldn&amp;#39;t ever get a day that she could get me in where he was there I mean we were willing to come at any time but it was like every day I spit out there was something that wasn&amp;#39;t able the doctor wasn&amp;#39;t able to accommodate so for some reason I just said can we come that day I mean she&amp;#39;s like absolutely and this was 10 o&amp;#39;clock in the morning we threw clothes on as we were about to walk out the door she called and said I&amp;#39;m sorry the doctor is scheduled that time off for a certain reason well being frustrated I just said can he just call just have him call me because it&amp;#39;s no big deal just tell us over the phone and it was a Friday I&amp;#39;m not spending the weekend wondering what could happen on Monday and so the doctor calls and I mean I remember it vividly we&amp;#39;re in Sam&amp;#39;s and he calls and he tells me my son has muscular dystrophy and it was a gut punch um I asked him if it was severe his answer was there is no severe well I guess in a Mother&amp;#39;s Eyes at this point Gunner was not severe and to wear a wheelchair is severe to me and then I said is are we looking at a wheelchair and he just said you know I can&amp;#39;t really tell you yes or no on that and I get it and after that we you know we came home and we had emotions and we cried and we would watch our son run around the yard and believe that there&amp;#39;s no way that our child has this there&amp;#39;s just no way that this is what&amp;#39;s going to consume him to get news like that over a phone call when you&amp;#39;re walking through a department store I&amp;#39;m there&amp;#39;s no way to capably be able to handle that correctly there&amp;#39;s nowhere to process it where we were in a public place I think the only thing that we did was we got out of there as quick as we could just so we could process like she said we the emotional difficulties that came with that conversation are just I don&amp;#39;t even care to recall them and I hope no one else have to ever experience well I immediately picked up the phone and I called Texas I guess we can say yeah we call Texas Children&amp;#39;s um and you know of course I&amp;#39;d already explained to her I&amp;#39;ve seen a neurologist I have test results please don&amp;#39;t make me start at the bottom we can&amp;#39;t do that again um we want to go straight to the source of where we need to be and I will tell you that lady was an angel send she did exactly what I needed her to do she got on the phone she made calls she got the referrals for us all set up in place um I sent her over the test results and I guess it was about a week later she called back and she asked us to come in to see their neurologist and so we get there and um well I guess we need to back up I&amp;#39;m sorry when I took him to go see the pediatrician to kind of discuss the diagnosis of muscular dystrophy um we get it people are human people make mistakes people the phone call was not the right way to give us a diagnosis like this and with the diagnosis like this and the other thing that really upset us too is the doctor the way he presented it was as we thought yes his exact words were as we fought it&amp;#39;s muscular dystrophy well like and that was completely out of the clear blue for us we were given no precursor warning the doctor when we were in the office never mentioned anything along those lines and so that was one of the reasons that made it so emotionally difficult had we had some sort of a warning today we&amp;#39;re looking it could be something like this along the lines of it I&amp;#39;m sure it would have still been very difficult to accept [Music] and as was it was just so out of the clear blue we couldn&amp;#39;t believe that those were the results because obviously being parents being this day and age we live in the very first thing you do is run to your phone and start looking up internet things on this prognosis and it wasn&amp;#39;t lining up for what we saw he was not supposed to be highly intelligent if he had that he is extremely highly intelligent he just he looked down the list and the symptoms did not add up to what our son is and so we needed some further guidance and suffering through it all weekend I mean our world collapsed for an entire weekend and she jumped on the phone Christy jumped on the phone immediately and got got a doctor&amp;#39;s appointment that Monday we went in to talk to our pediatrician and I just I really wanted some kind of guidance I didn&amp;#39;t know where do we start because you know as parents you fight you fight for your children and you do what you&amp;#39;ve got to do to get on the help they need and she came in and again she&amp;#39;s our favorite we love her to death and she just you know she&amp;#39;s just said for one I&amp;#39;m going to tell you I would have never saw this coming and she sat down and she read the results and she read the blood test and she read the results and she read the blood test and actually not just her but another doctor there that knew us as well so we had two doctors that actually knew us knew our family personally that read over the results numerous times and said they don&amp;#39;t see it all they could see is that Gunner was a carrier of muscular dystrophy which means he has the Gene and that if he ever had decided to have children and if it was his wife and his choice they could be tested if the mother had the gene the gene could mutate we were super relieved super relief but at the same time we still wanted that extra everything is okay yeah again as a parent once you&amp;#39;re told something&amp;#39;s wrong with your child you don&amp;#39;t just leave it wide open everything&amp;#39;s gonna be okay moving forward you need that final the finality to it what is this how do I overcome this what do we need to do for our kid to make our kid okay and so that&amp;#39;s when we went to Texas Children&amp;#39;s looking for more answers looking for more definitive answers at that to what we needed to do moving forward what our son actually had again we were still thinking it was probably like a neurological tick or something like that that was going to need some physical therapy something minor but nothing major and even going to Texas Children&amp;#39;s the first time I got a very warm feeling the hospital is phenomenal please do not get us wrong this is nothing against Texas Children&amp;#39;s they clearly have done nothing wrong and this was the prognosis that we got was in no way their fault we just with Gunner&amp;#39;s Journey we want to be raw we want to be real we want to because we are finding ourselves in a position that Gunner is one of the youngest known diagnosed in America with this disease and where he is the researcher and he will go due to the links of what he&amp;#39;s got to do to look I&amp;#39;m afraid to go down those rabbit holes I don&amp;#39;t want to see it I don&amp;#39;t want to know I don&amp;#39;t want to I don&amp;#39;t want to face it until it hits me in the face and that&amp;#39;s all I can do is face it um and that&amp;#39;s actually one of the things that makes this the most difficult for us because I don&amp;#39;t know what to share with her and she doesn&amp;#39;t know how to ask me about certain things um you know it&amp;#39;s never good to hide things in our relationship and we&amp;#39;re not intentionally hiding something from one another once we bottle our emotions so we don&amp;#39;t hurt the other of the others having a good day you don&amp;#39;t want to you don&amp;#39;t want to take away from their good day or you know what yeah yeah what may not be on their mind you know um but let&amp;#39;s back to the story we&amp;#39;ve Gonna we took Gunner to to the neurologist at Texas Children&amp;#39;s and he came in and he watched kind of like the same test that the other neurologist did and um he just looked at us and he said I just don&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s muscular dystrophy he said I believe it&amp;#39;s a form of ataxia well I&amp;#39;ve never heard the word before I didn&amp;#39;t know what it was they didn&amp;#39;t make it sound like it was a major deal at the time and Jill&amp;#39;s kind of like okay cool I mean you just you leave thinking okay you know this is gonna be okay it&amp;#39;s gonna be perfectly fine you know he&amp;#39;s just a little wobbly and it&amp;#39;s going to be his life and he gets it from his mom so um he requested that we do another DNA test that focuses more on the brain and a certain area of the brain where the friedrichs Ataxia attacks back it from my understanding is the back base of the brain um yeah I don&amp;#39;t remember the exact portion of the brain and like I said we&amp;#39;re learning we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re going through the motions as we can um there&amp;#39;s limited information on this because it&amp;#39;s a rare disease not just for children but across the board there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s not a lot of cases known I think it&amp;#39;s estimated between 20 and 50 000 people or all that are known to have it total in the world well um so we we did the DNA test and it was maybe three weeks later they always set you up they always tell you it&amp;#39;s going to be a couple of months so you you&amp;#39;re breathing but you&amp;#39;re not breathing through it all and uh the phone rang and again we were home I don&amp;#39;t know why we were home I don&amp;#39;t know if it was the evening time or it was all such a blur I think is but he called and he he told us that Gunner had free drinks ataxia and um both of us were kind of like okay yeah what the hell what is this you know like what okay you know and he wanted us to come in well you know if they want you to come in it&amp;#39;s probably not more on the Lighter Side especially when they want you to come in right away um he got us in that that Monday it was a Thursday or Friday we came in that next business day and um they&amp;#39;re amazing they every question we had they didn&amp;#39;t it wasn&amp;#39;t necessarily they had answers to but they were willing to find out um when we I keep skipping all over the place because like I said we&amp;#39;re doing this wrong we&amp;#39;re not we&amp;#39;re not sugar coding yeah we&amp;#39;re not we literally walked in from the other room and said let&amp;#39;s do it now or else we&amp;#39;re not going to be able to do this um we&amp;#39;re trying to make this kind of a ongoing series to help anybody again whether it be our friends someone in our family heck looking back on it it might even help you or I or we haven&amp;#39;t heard you know you know Gunner whoever anyone that we can help with these videos is the purposeful well and back to the neurology the first initial neurologist appointment when he had mentioned it was a form of ataxia he told us that there is a specialist of an Ataxia specialist there&amp;#39;s two of them in the southeast United States and both of them worked at Texas Children&amp;#39;s Hospital in Houston one was there today and he was there or he was there that day and he was able to meet with us and um until we talked to him about a video and this I don&amp;#39;t want to really use his name or you know throw him out until yeah until we get him okay and on board or not whatever but he the minute he walked in you could tell that Gunner was his top priority he studied Gunner he never took his eyes off a Gunner he was he was enamored Gunner is the best way to put it I mean you see one like she said when when he walked in it was like a kid with the new video game but it kind of ways what it reminded me of is whoa what do we have here he lit up and he was really fascinated by Gunner and his entire story he wanted to know more about him he wanted to be able to research with Gunner and see you could see it wasn&amp;#39;t just another case some doctors and look there&amp;#39;s nothing against anybody out there in any field I understand that at certain points in your career you just go cold because you&amp;#39;ve experienced it too many times repeatedly I get it with this doctor that wasn&amp;#39;t the case any of them but I mean him especially when he walked in he he lit up the room he could feel he was so happy to be there with us which was almost a bizarre feeling in today&amp;#39;s modern world having somebody to be so happy to be in a room with you when something so traumatic is going on well and and both of us you know having strong faith in the Lord I I think God knew at that time we needed him and we needed him to be there right then to jump on um when we went back after the diagnosis it was tough to hear I still don&amp;#39;t 100 understand exactly um I know it will affect his Mobility it will possibly eventually take away his Mobility it will eat in his organs it it affects every part of who he is that&amp;#39;s what this disease is it typically does not come on until the late 20s early 30s we&amp;#39;re awaiting to hear results back from a cardiologist depending on what the cardiologist says could indicate how much of a life he&amp;#39;s going to have we don&amp;#39;t know at this point we&amp;#39;ve been told from what I&amp;#39;ve read problems with the heart can lead to a much shorter life for people with ataxia but if they have a normal heart if they don&amp;#39;t have any of the major problems there&amp;#39;s been cases living to their 60s and 70s and I&amp;#39;m sure some even longer they&amp;#39;re the obvious first question that everybody has is what can we do right now there&amp;#39;s only one medicine out there that&amp;#39;s approved for Ataxia for Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia and it&amp;#39;s only been approved for about a year I believe if that but it&amp;#39;s only approved for 18 and up right now um Gunner has a long list of doctor&amp;#39;s appointments um we had an appointment scheduled for a cardiologist um in the day before the appointment they called and said that because we have already done the EKG and the echo that that is not where we need to be that we need to be at cardiomyopathy um that appointment is in October I believe um which kind of leaves you out in the wild just wondering what&amp;#39;s going on it would have been nice to have a little bit of a follow-up just to say hey here&amp;#39;s the path we&amp;#39;re on here&amp;#39;s what we need to be looking at everything over here looks good or hey everything over here looks really bad we need to pay attention to this well and and my chart can be a curse and it can be a blessing it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the internet yeah it&amp;#39;s an image of the internet the second you get two words out of a doctor you got to go run and search them up and go oh this is what he meant no that&amp;#39;s not about what he meant but you know right as concerned parents that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re going to do um Gunner doesn&amp;#39;t know Gunner knows he has something wrong with him but he doesn&amp;#39;t know exactly what it is at this point the best way that anyone has described what&amp;#39;s going on with dinner is Gunner himself he told his classmates in kindergarten that he had a virus of the brain and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a really remarkable thing for a six-year-old to be able to tell some other kids and actually and honestly he told the doctor that and the doctor thought that was pretty incredible he said he never heard it quite put that way before but it was a very accurate very understandable description of what was going on the best thing you can do for us if you&amp;#39;re the praying kind just pray for him I believe that this is Gunner&amp;#39;s testimony and he either is the cure or he&amp;#39;s going to find the Cure it&amp;#39;s hard it&amp;#39;s hard watching your child and all the dreams that you had for them it&amp;#39;s hard watching them and not knowing what people will say about him it&amp;#39;s hard thinking about the things that he can encounter in life I&amp;#39;m sure it is with all parents I I mean it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s different with this child because we were basically told the way that Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia works is he&amp;#39;s going to slowly diminish before our eyes he&amp;#39;s going to slowly lose abilities and to be told that as a parent to have a child that&amp;#39;s going to slowly be taken away from you in front of your own eyes I can&amp;#39;t tell you the amount of pain that both of us in we stay strong as we can not just for him but for our daughter as well for us ourselves um but it&amp;#39;s not an easy thing to do there&amp;#39;s a lot of times where I think specifically when we&amp;#39;re not around each other that we let some of those Gardens down and let some of that paint out [Music] again it&amp;#39;s all about you don&amp;#39;t want the other one to feed onto your day that you&amp;#39;re having or your fear that you&amp;#39;re having or and it&amp;#39;s not so much that we keep the fear from each other it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s one of those things where if you watch him and he stumbles it&amp;#39;s no longer it&amp;#39;s no longer oh he&amp;#39;s clumsy it&amp;#39;s oh gosh is it worse is it getting worse is it taking over and is it and we&amp;#39;ve been told that we may not be able to see the changes because we&amp;#39;re with them every day it&amp;#39;s that slow moving but then again he&amp;#39;s also six years old and it&amp;#39;s a completely different case than what anyone else has dealt with to speak of and there are cases where it moves more progressively faster cases where it moves more progressively slow there&amp;#39;s cases where it&amp;#39;s less severe and more severe and you know you&amp;#39;re sitting here wondering is this the type of wound that&amp;#39;s going to have to be taken to the hospital and stitched up or is this the type of room we go to the closet right there and abandoned it and fix it and there&amp;#39;s no one telling you either way there&amp;#39;s no no hey we can do this test and possibly give you some more answers we haven&amp;#39;t gotten any of that and that&amp;#39;s not a knock on anybody I don&amp;#39;t know there is a test that you can run to determine that there&amp;#39;s not that much information out there on this and again that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons we&amp;#39;re wanting to do this is because if our journey can help someone else if it&amp;#39;s a year from now if it&amp;#39;s 10 years from now whatever if it&amp;#39;s a month from now it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if we can help somebody else in a similar situation or somebody else that&amp;#39;s suffering through some of the stuff that we&amp;#39;re going through and we can reach out we know and you know because as our parents as parents you know I think a couple weeks ago I came to Chris and I told him I said you know as bad as this sounds like I picture it as a like a diagnosis that can be treated and why aren&amp;#39;t we fighting why aren&amp;#39;t we doing things to make our son better I feel like I&amp;#39;m failing my child because I&amp;#39;m not fighting I&amp;#39;m not I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know what to do I don&amp;#39;t know what to make this better I don&amp;#39;t know what to do I can&amp;#39;t take it away I can&amp;#39;t take it from him and that&amp;#39;s the raw of it there is nothing there is nothing to do but sit and wait and pray and hope and I have never felt more weak and defenseless in my entire life than I have getting this prognosis for him and like you said just being told to sit back and wait and see what happens us that&amp;#39;s one of the most horrifying things that a parent can be told and I mean I understand it is what it is there&amp;#39;s nothing else that they can really tell us unfortunately no but it doesn&amp;#39;t make it easier it&amp;#39;s just we want to make it clear that we&amp;#39;re not placing blame on them no no that&amp;#39;s you know we&amp;#39;re not placing blame on anyone it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s our emotions it&amp;#39;s the feeling it&amp;#39;s the the roller coaster of it all you know and you could be having a bad day and Gunner will come out with one of his witty witty smart alec comments and no I I will be honest with you at some point in time I&amp;#39;m sure God will be involved with these videos being one of our son is a huge smartass he is highly intelligent and I love him to death but he is a huge smartass it really is I mean for his age he&amp;#39;s highly intelligent he knows how to get what he wants huh he convinced us to get him his own cell phone at six years old and how did he do that you may ask we traded in our cell phones to get the somewhat newer model and in the time frame of trading them in mailing them in whatever we did with them used his mother&amp;#39;s old cell phone for a week or two on Wi-Fi no big deal right until your son gets back over from his babysitters to your to his grandma&amp;#39;s house gets Wi-Fi and picks up the phone and texts you and calls you and says I just wanted to let you know how much I love you and miss you and not just once every day how do you argue with a six-year-old that calls you and tells you I love you and I miss you I&amp;#39;ll never stop loving you the the boys not only is he highly intelligent he&amp;#39;s highly caring and you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of one of those funny things it&amp;#39;s I watch different shows and think about my life growing up and I know he&amp;#39;s going to get picked on as he gets older I know he will that doesn&amp;#39;t bother me that&amp;#39;s part of life that&amp;#39;s part of growing up I&amp;#39;m sorry for anybody out there that doesn&amp;#39;t believe that but the truth you know it is that doesn&amp;#39;t bother me his smart ass smell getting him into a situation where he&amp;#39;s gonna get beat up is what bothers me um but we just we figured you know documenting this to you for one keep our friends and family in the loop and we haven&amp;#39;t shared with anybody really some of our deepest feelings about this we&amp;#39;ve told some people what&amp;#39;s going on but the amount of emotional drain that this puts on us we haven&amp;#39;t talked about it&amp;#39;s something that stresses our stresses us to our limits every day every waking hour and not even that&amp;#39;s not even fair probably because we stress about it even trying to sleep yeah and I mean that both literally and figuratively because our son still sleeps with us and through the slaps and the punches and the kicks that we get which is also some part of what&amp;#39;s going on with them because he gets restless leg and stuff like that I don&amp;#39;t know about the flailing arm syndrome but yes I get slapped in the middle of the night sometimes and yes I wake up pissed off um but it&amp;#39;s just you know you don&amp;#39;t know what no one&amp;#39;s got the the book that says hey follow these steps and you know you can&amp;#39;t change the course but here&amp;#39;s at least the courses that you&amp;#39;re on the path that you&amp;#39;re on nobody can give us that other than your head towards the car rack and it&amp;#39;s you know come on give me give me some guideline am I going down the freeway am I going down the back road am I well the steering wheel one way yeah something do I at least know the airbag is going to deploy something but it&amp;#39;s really how do you go to friends and family and explain what we&amp;#39;re going through when you can&amp;#39;t explain it to each other there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no right word for it you know I I don&amp;#39;t know um you know I think this past month I&amp;#39;ve been in make the appointments mode do this do this we&amp;#39;ve got to get this scheduled we&amp;#39;ve got to get this doing you know got to get this going got to get all this turned in and it&amp;#39;s but when you sit down and you stop and you just think it&amp;#39;s scary as hell you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s I mean you watch your son walk out the door and you don&amp;#39;t know how long it&amp;#39;s going to be until you can&amp;#39;t do that anymore you know or just coming downstairs or walk running around in the yard you know you don&amp;#39;t know how long it&amp;#39;s going to be till you&amp;#39;ve got to go pick him up and put them in I remember watching him play with the dog no one how long you&amp;#39;ll be able to do that you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the smallest things in the world thinking of for a six-year-old you know you want to see him riding a bike you want to see him running around the yard playing ball we don&amp;#39;t know that we&amp;#39;re able to put our son in sports because we don&amp;#39;t know what his shape of his heart is you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just so many unanswered things you know and we just we want everybody to be a part of his journey and show you what a warrior he is what a fighter he is and I believe there&amp;#39;s more to this than what we&amp;#39;re being presented with I I believe that there&amp;#39;s a reason why we found this so young I believe that you know and I think this is where Chris and I also we have differences is not differences we we&amp;#39;re on two different emotional roller coasters it&amp;#39;s you know I&amp;#39;m trying to put all my faith in God because in all honesty I&amp;#39;m scared if I don&amp;#39;t the devil&amp;#39;s gonna win I can&amp;#39;t say that I&amp;#39;m doing the same I&amp;#39;ve been very angry with God at times um namely because why would he do this to a child and I understand there&amp;#39;s lots of bad things in this world that happen to lots of great kids but something long and drawn out to such an innocent child it&amp;#39;s just whether it be my son or someone else&amp;#39;s kid it shouldn&amp;#39;t happen and um you know I it&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t know that Gunner is going to change this disease I know Kirsten believes that he&amp;#39;s going to be the Cure I don&amp;#39;t know that he will definitively be the Cure but I do believe that he will help impact this for the positive and on that I also think it&amp;#39;s really important that we mention that we&amp;#39;re looking into um criminal clinical trials and stuff like that for gunner on behalf of not just Gunner but future Generations future kids if there&amp;#39;s something logical that we can do to help treat this it&amp;#39;s not going to negatively impact him you know obviously it&amp;#39;s clinical trial you don&amp;#39;t know for sure nothing is definitive with that but if it&amp;#39;s hey you&amp;#39;ve got a five percent chance of improving him in a 95 chance of doing harm to him hell no we&amp;#39;re not doing that we&amp;#39;re not being stupid about it we&amp;#39;re you know but we are looking we are fighting we are you know we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re doing everything we possibly can to and again they&amp;#39;ve been taken care of yeah if there&amp;#39;s a clinical trial he goes to and sure enough they find it improves him by 20 then every other kid out there in his situation may stand to benefit from them we&amp;#39;re first and foremost it&amp;#39;s to get Gunner better but at the same time if it helps another child or another family who is going through this so be it um and I don&amp;#39;t know how frequent we&amp;#39;ll do these I don&amp;#39;t know you know our plan is to eventually introduce everyone to that doesn&amp;#39;t know Gunner personally that how what his life looks like and what the wobbly gate is and um one of the cutest things about Gunner is when we&amp;#39;re in Texas Children&amp;#39;s you know being a six-year-old and the doctor that I talked about seemed like he got his new video game he asked Gunner what his favorite video game is and it&amp;#39;s still True to this day which is about what five six months ago doctor looked at me said so what&amp;#39;s your favorite video game without missing a beat yeah it turns to him looks someone says wobbly life um the way I have kind of perceived friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia is it kind of gives off like a drunk person approach um when you see him walking he&amp;#39;ll he&amp;#39;ll stumble to one side he doesn&amp;#39;t really fall um he does a lot of tripping he does a lot of walking into walls or yeah it makes you think that he&amp;#39;s not paying attention where he&amp;#39;s going a lot of times yeah like hey watch where you&amp;#39;re walking buddy hey you know pay attention especially being a kid with the cell phone and everything else it&amp;#39;s a lot of times and I&amp;#39;m guilty of it too I&amp;#39;ve yelled at him and hey pay attention watch what you&amp;#39;re doing and it&amp;#39;s me thinking hey if you&amp;#39;re paying attention and watching what you&amp;#39;re doing maybe you won&amp;#39;t stumble maybe you want this maybe it&amp;#39;ll help you in the future maybe but the truth is is we just don&amp;#39;t know well and part of the attack is is the brain is the brain is telling the muscle to move a certain way but the muscle is not reacting to that wave I guess is what you call it or um so you&amp;#39;ll notice like Gunner might drag his leg not really drag it just kind of like flops I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain it some of his actions he moved you don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re intentional or not uncontrolled or if you watch him run you would think we&amp;#39;d never let our child run a day in his life you know after your head you&amp;#39;re screaming run Forrest run it&amp;#39;s but um and please don&amp;#39;t you know like we have to find laughter in this we have to to get us through the days we have to laugh about some of it and even Gunner will tell you it&amp;#39;s you know because I&amp;#39;m wobbly because you know and I think maybe he uses that a little too much as an excuse we love him unconditionally there&amp;#39;s I I told him the other day I said and this is the truth about how I feel about both of my children both of my kids were gifts from God every day that I have with him is a present they don&amp;#39;t ever have to give me anything for the rest of the time the day that I&amp;#39;m alive or on this planet because they are my gifts every day that I have with them I cherish there&amp;#39;s nothing in this world that means more to me than them and I love you and you know I am I I mean it we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re all fighting this as a family and I mean our parents our sisters our brothers our best friends you know like we have we have a great support system um but I think it&amp;#39;s too with them you don&amp;#39;t want to ruin their Days by because everybody has their own thing you know and this is such a difficult thing to deal with we are trying to internalize it and not burden anyone else with it I think is the best way well and I think too like I was talking to a friend a couple weeks ago and she told me you know I know my son&amp;#39;s diagnosis is nothing like Gunners and my heart kind of broke a little bit because I don&amp;#39;t ever want someone to feel like their child is less than my child is I guess how you would word it and I just told her I said you know regardless both of what they have has been life-altering it it changes everything you know um from waiting to get into our house to we don&amp;#39;t know if we can live here in a couple years you know because it&amp;#39;s a two-story house and he might not be able to get up and down the stairs or um lead up to the house there&amp;#39;s three or four stairs that lead up to the house and that might be too much um you know we&amp;#39;d drive a pickup truck is that going to be too tall for them uh you know it&amp;#39;s just the doorways if he&amp;#39;s having to use a wheelchair the doorway is wide enough I mean there&amp;#39;s a billion different things that you have to did you don&amp;#39;t have to think about but as a caring parent you do think about you already start questioning you already start worrying about you know it&amp;#39;s your deepest fears are exaggerated because of the condition that you&amp;#39;re placed upon into Christie&amp;#39;s point whatever your kid is suffering from I&amp;#39;m sorry for whatever they&amp;#39;re suffering from even if it&amp;#39;s just a scratched elbow scraped up knee from a bike ride whatever I&amp;#39;m sorry my kid&amp;#39;s not any worse off than your kid but it&amp;#39;s this is our story of what we&amp;#39;re dealing with and well and see we want to we want to be open with Gunner&amp;#39;s diagnosis and we have been pretty private about it up until now um but I think it was more so because we didn&amp;#39;t no we don&amp;#39;t we still don&amp;#39;t know but at this point we&amp;#39;re just tired of not knowing and you know that&amp;#39;s the hard thing is when you go to tell people about what&amp;#39;s going on here&amp;#39;s what he has what does that mean we don&amp;#39;t know what are you gonna do for it but we don&amp;#39;t know the winds start really happening we don&amp;#39;t know what is the warning signs we don&amp;#39;t know I mean it&amp;#39;s you know It&amp;#39;s a cruel joke in a lot of ways so I think that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons we&amp;#39;ve been a lot more private with it is because you just you don&amp;#39;t have any answers you know and so I think I think maybe privately even though we haven&amp;#39;t really discussed it I think that&amp;#39;s one of the things about this video that we&amp;#39;re hoping in some ways is that by expressing our feelings and some of the things that we&amp;#39;ve learned and some of the things we&amp;#39;re witnessing on this that maybe some of our friends and family can get those answers that we otherwise can&amp;#39;t provide well and just watching it you know our plan is to video some of Gunner and you know eventually getting him into this and um he&amp;#39;s already been in trouble for youtubing by the way in November we are we are going to meet a man who has fa also and he is doing a race and he um I reached out to him just because more so of I needed to know what it is I need to know what it looks like I need to know you know from someone who has it not something that Google tells me is what it is or um and so he you know reaching out to him he&amp;#39;s been he&amp;#39;s been great in in just he invited us to come meet with him and and I think it&amp;#39;s time we start introducing not only ourselves but Gunner to the fa world and you know understanding that you know as a parent with no answers you don&amp;#39;t know really how to approach this with your child and my theory is you know if if you haven&amp;#39;t been that lifestyle maybe it won&amp;#39;t be such a big shock you know um maybe it&amp;#39;ll be a little bit easier to transition into or I think it&amp;#39;s one of those things as a parent you do everything you can to help prepare your child for the life they&amp;#39;re going to face but in the situation we&amp;#39;re in we don&amp;#39;t know what that is we don&amp;#39;t know how long that is we don&amp;#39;t know what type of life that is we don&amp;#39;t know almost anything and so it&amp;#39;s you know I joked earlier about getting mad at him for different things and getting upset with them he&amp;#39;s a six-year-old kid you&amp;#39;re going to get upset at times but then I immediately turn back around and go think of what you&amp;#39;re going to miss out on if you&amp;#39;re upset with them and so you get upset with yourself but then you you have to remind yourself that it&amp;#39;s okay to be upset without a kid yeah he&amp;#39;s still gonna have to face punishments and um but you know from from here on on if you guys have any questions please don&amp;#39;t hesitate you know there might be things where we look at you and say we don&amp;#39;t know and we honestly just don&amp;#39;t know yeah we&amp;#39;re gonna post this to YouTube um we may post it to Facebook as well I don&amp;#39;t know but honestly I would prefer if you don&amp;#39;t mind even if your friends or family if you have questions put them on YouTube and the reason I&amp;#39;m asking that is because if there&amp;#39;s something a good question out there everybody&amp;#39;s going to have questions okay there is no bad question but some of your questions and some of our answers could help other people could help other of our friends could help other of our family like she said could help gunner in the future could help a complete stranger going through this situation so why take away from any of those people well it&amp;#39;s too fast with us putting it out there and there might be someone that has an answer for governor or you know it&amp;#39;s just something we felt compelled to do and you know this is this is Gunner story but right now we&amp;#39;re telling it because he doesn&amp;#39;t know a lot about it the way we explain it to him is he&amp;#39;s wobbly you know and and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re at right now and I think we both agreed that as the things come on we&amp;#39;ll approach it from there and when it&amp;#39;s time it&amp;#39;s time we&amp;#39;ll tell them but right now he&amp;#39;s a six-year-old little six-year-old little boy that loves his video games and I think right now the videos are more for you and I and for our family directly and then as Gunner gets older he can understand that we&amp;#39;ve been here the whole time worried about him the whole time we&amp;#39;re fighting for him and that&amp;#39;s something really important for anyone to know is that their parents really did love them and they really did fight the flu especially in the case of any child that has a illness you know to know that your parents really do love you and they&amp;#39;re never going to give up so if anybody sees us from time to time and we&amp;#39;re just down or we&amp;#39;re stressed out we&amp;#39;ll be in quiet or being distant it&amp;#39;s not that we mean to be it&amp;#39;s just overwhelming it&amp;#39;s our life it&amp;#39;s our life right now it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very difficult and there&amp;#39;s we don&amp;#39;t want to burden any more people than we have to with what&amp;#39;s going on because it is a burden it is a very challenging deeply emotional burden and I don&amp;#39;t mean that in a negative way against gonna but personally it&amp;#39;s a lot for anyone to deal with and we don&amp;#39;t want to put that burden on anyone that we don&amp;#39;t have to again we don&amp;#39;t know how regular we&amp;#39;ll do these or you know I mean it&amp;#39;s kind of a great little therapy session to get those fears out but um I&amp;#39;m doing away with fuzzy Kelly [Laughter] you do away with cow you&amp;#39;ll have a real one in here pretty soon um but again you know love our boy hug on him he&amp;#39;s you know he is a gift from God and he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s not fragile you&amp;#39;re not gonna break him you&amp;#39;re not gonna you know if he&amp;#39;s doing something tell you exactly the way he feels doing something wrong by ball means you you get a hold of him and tear them up and you know we don&amp;#39;t treat him differently we don&amp;#39;t expect anyone else to treat him differently um if he acts up he gets in trouble he gets in trouble so but again if you have any questions don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t hesitate to reach out to us we&amp;#39;re I think we&amp;#39;re at the point where we&amp;#39;re ready to tell our story in Gunner&amp;#39;s story and and if these start gaining more and more traction they&amp;#39;ve you know I don&amp;#39;t expect these to get thousands upon thousands of lives for my family and my friends but if they if if there are other people around the world that are interested in this we can set up an email or something like that to where they can contact us as well um or if you know someone that&amp;#39;s in our shoes and and yeah contact and just talk about it by all means you know it&amp;#39;s just we&amp;#39;re wide open to suggestion exactly so exactly yeah all right well I guess you end up with see you yeah until next time attached healing",

    "transcript": "well uh thank you sh for setting things off and all the you and your team does we can&amp;#39;t thank you all enough um well basically um what I want to talk about is several things we have of course um a a couple of it was twins not identical twins but twin sisters on Fox News this last Friday um they&amp;#39;re in their teen but they their story started when they were born okay U one of them had a disease is called Frederick&amp;#39;s at taxia they can&amp;#39;t stand up they&amp;#39;re dizzy all the time and um they say it&amp;#39;s a genetic thing and and they don&amp;#39;t live very long and now I think that you know they&amp;#39;re teenagers and um they were on Fox News and they didn&amp;#39;t have a phone number or anything or the town they were from or their last names so I couldn&amp;#39;t I tried very hard and and kept going back on there to see if they were going to give more information on those two kids but um but I looked it up friedrich&amp;#39;s a tax here is something that deals with the white matter of the of the back of the brain and the spinal cord this is all dealt with uh in the um let&amp;#39;s see here we have the the CD that goes along on with Dead Doctors Don&amp;#39;t Lie okay the CD Dead Doctors Don&amp;#39;t Lie we have this the DVD dead doors lie the 2our one big one okay then of course we have the CD we just now got our supply of these CDs they&amp;#39;re a half hour okay it deals with the AI stuff okay the AI stuff artificial intelligence then of course the book Dead doal line and it&amp;#39;s one of those things were uh you know you can contact us at the wellness Publications or contact Milan and get some of these DVDs and the whole idea of the um artificial intelligence it goes back thousands of years and they came up with fences so you could sleep at night and your horses and cows weren&amp;#39;t going to run away because they&amp;#39;re inside the fence okay those are some of the first types of artificial intelligence and then uh later of course when they had electricity they came out with um if you have these things on your wall to control the temperature in your house right and um the uh let&amp;#39;s say you set it for 75 and it goes down outside to 60 you&amp;#39;re asleep it&amp;#39;ll kick on and bring the temperature up in the house it&amp;#39;ll heat up to 75 on the other hand if it&amp;#39;s summertime and it gets up to in the 80s the um the one that cools the house kicks on okay and gets the temperature back down to 65 or 70 whatever you set it at while you&amp;#39;re asleep that&amp;#39;s AI artificial intelligence and then of course it had all kinds of fire alarms automatic sprinklers for your backyard so you didn&amp;#39;t have to stay up at half hour twice a day to sprinkle the lawn and um those kinds of things uh it&amp;#39;s one of those things where the AI was pretty good for thousands of years what went down the tubes when they incorporate it into medicine because let&amp;#39;s say somebody has the metabolic syndrome they have abdom obesity they have uh type two diabetes and they have the high blood pressure and you want to help them lose weight or you want to help them with their diabetes you just give them insulin to inject into themselves to lower their their um blood sugar okay and so it&amp;#39;s one of those things where the others don&amp;#39;t get any treatment just eat well stay away from the bad foods everything will be fine it&amp;#39;s genetic there&amp;#39;s not much we can do about it except you know we can treat the diabetes we can treat the Hy pressure and that kind of stuff but when you are doing everything yourself this is when the accidents happen Okay and of course those two kids those two sisters that had the Frederick&amp;#39;s Axia um it goes along with the flip chart the flip chart has all these different diseases that afflict the white matter of the brain okay the milon in the brain and when you have all this demonization everything goes wrong in the brain and the spinal cord and also the large nerves coming out of the brain including the optic nerve you get osteoprosis of the skull squeezing the optic nerve as well and so there&amp;#39;s all this stuff going on and doctors don&amp;#39;t know about this they just know that you got this problem and they they blame it on your jeans because they don&amp;#39;t know the cause and so now these are available now we have a supply we had them made and the reason why we have this is because our association with Charlie Ward who&amp;#39;s one of the big big big TV Personalities in Europe Intel doc he&amp;#39;s an Intel provider he works with Trump he works with Trump okay well there you go and so um he he had us on and interviewed us and all this kind of stuff and so he says make one on AI and so we made this on AI it has one of his um stars okay Paul Booker the guy in between Dr Randy and myself and he kind of ran the show and asked questions and everything and so I&amp;#39;m really kind of excited you know that they&amp;#39;re playing it now in Europe and I want to know how good this gets I want to know um if they&amp;#39;re going to buy any of these Dead Doctors Don&amp;#39;t y CDs the DVDs the books Hell&amp;#39;s Kitchen uh we have we have a d we have a CD for Hell&amp;#39;s Kitchen um and we have the book um let&amp;#39;s see here um oh epigenetics takes a place of genetics epigenetics and epigenetics of course um there no generically transmitted diseases when the doctor says oh you have this genetic thing you pull your pants up and you walk out you say okay sorry I&amp;#39;m going to somebody is intelligent you don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re talking okay and so it&amp;#39;s one of those things that we have the ability to deal with over um 600 different diseases uh we have the products to deal with that we have 2500 products we have access to and this is uh Hell&amp;#39;s Kitchen of course is a great one let&amp;#39;s play doctor another big one um tells you how to diagnose things tells you how to decide what you&amp;#39;re going to treat it with and how to fix it and we&amp;#39;re talking about arthritis osteoprosis anemia we&amp;#39;re talking about high blood pressure diabetes um all that kind of stuff also all the the brain stuff okay Parkinson disase Parkinson disase forever they were calling it an aging genetic problem and we&amp;#39;ve gotten rid of I don&amp;#39;t know hundreds of of people yeah of cases all over the world now um with this and it&amp;#39;s one of those things where um they missed it Parkins these by a million miles it&amp;#39;s not genetic it&amp;#39;s not an aging thing it&amp;#39;s a simple nutritional deficiency just like Frederick&amp;#39;s at taxia and kids and so it&amp;#39;s one of those things where we just keep telling the story we have the tools now we had I don&amp;#39;t know we had maybe I think maybe a thousand printed of these um of these uh DVDs okay oh and Doc guess what what this is important this is exciting Ford Motor Company is going to start putting CD players in vehicles again the demand was there for so so when people start buying new vehicles they&amp;#39;ll be able to get CD players as standard equipment oh good that&amp;#39;s the time to listen to it when you you gotta go on a vacation or if you drive a long way for your job you can listen to the CDs all the time get educated instead of just listening to music on the radio yeah you&amp;#39;re they don&amp;#39;t want you to talk on the phone but you can certainly listen listen to your CDs on your vehicle and I know Betty uh didn&amp;#39;t buy a Ford simply because they had quit putting CDs in she bought a different vehicle I would assume that the fact that Ford is going to put them back in that other manufacturers will take follow their lead and do the same thing because they&amp;#39;re not going to want to lose sales over this and they will they will because people like to listen to CDs and I like to have my own CDs I&amp;#39;m not into artificial intelligence and all this stuff I like to actually physically have a CD that I own that I can put in the player and listen to and I don&amp;#39;t care about storage they they don&amp;#39;t take up a lot of room put it that way that&amp;#39;s true take our spiritual intelligence and D it you know with your D it out the door I I turn my temperature up and down by hand I don&amp;#39;t depend on some computer that&amp;#39;s just more stuff to go Haywire my name is Murphy if it&amp;#39;s gonna break it will break for me so yeah no I okay let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s go let&amp;#39;s go to some questions okay if you have a question you can wave at me physic or you can push the um raise your hand button I think um said she and de has some questions so y go ahead Judy you got to unmute oops okay there we go I was trying to unmute us okay uh uh longtime customer was recently diagnosed with glaucoma what should she do besides take drops she already takes she already takes the product okay well she&amp;#39;s made she need to make sure that she&amp;#39;s taking everything she needs to make sure that the skull is not squeezing the optic nerve and the optic vein which can cause pressure in the eyes Okay and the nerve gets pressed and you get blurry vision and all that kind of stuff because the um is squeezing the optic nerve okay remember remember my my famous picture that I love and it&amp;#39;s all in your head yep here we go and Page Six it&amp;#39;s also on page I think it&amp;#39;s 32 32 in the flip chart the same pictures in the flip chart the top one&amp;#39;s a normal skull they&amp;#39;ve taken the top of the skull off at autopsy and you&amp;#39;re looking down in the brain you see that the skull&amp;#39;s at quarter of an inch thick that&amp;#39;s normal the bottom one is also an autopsy it took the top of the skull off looking down in the brain but you see the skull is an inch and a half to two inches thick that&amp;#39;s obious approach to the skull what happens is the skull is squeezing the spinal cord is it&amp;#39;s coming out the backside it&amp;#39;s also squeezing the pairs of cranial nerves on each side right and left and it tells you what tissue what what organ is being uh sent nerve impulses and and taking information back into the brain uh in that particular nerve and the side page it&amp;#39;s a white bar Gray Bar white bar Gray Bar each one of those represents a chapter in this book and it tells you what you&amp;#39;re going to see when that particular nerve is being squeezed and it tells you what you need to do to solve the problem okay but um that&amp;#39;s the first time that anybody ever talked about I Opress to the skull and doctors laugh and slap their leg when somebody say well yeah uh I I was diagnosed with osto proess skull he said who told you that there&amp;#39;s no such thing because they don&amp;#39;t get taught about osteoprosis of the skull in medical school they just get taught about um osteoprosis of your leg bones and your pelvis the healthy body Star

    "transcript": "have you ever wondered how certain diseases are passed down through generations silently shadowing families across the globe today we delve into the world of one such condition Frederick taxia imagine a genetic jigsaw puzzle a complex and intricate pattern that&amp;#39;s unique to each of us now think of a single piece slightly off-kilter causing a ripple effect across the entire picture that&amp;#39;s Frederick at taxia a condition that&amp;#39;s as fascinating as it is formidable born from a recessive trait it&amp;#39;s a disease that often lurks undetected only to surface in later generations it&amp;#39;s a condition that affects the nervous system impacting the body&amp;#39;s ability to coordinate movements it&amp;#39;s like a puppeteer strings being slowly inexorably cut yet it&amp;#39;s not all doom and gloom our understanding of Frederick Ataxia has grown Leaps and Bounds and while it remains a progressive disease with no known cure there&amp;#39;s a wealth of information to explore so what makes Frederick Axia so unique and noteworthy let&amp;#39;s uncover the mystery behind this condition Frederick Ataxia is not just a name it&amp;#39;s a life-altering condition that leaves its mark on every aspect of a person&amp;#39;s life Frederick Ataxia also known as fredri Ataxia is a rare genetic disorder that primarily damages the nervous system this damage results in a range of physical complications from muscle weakness to speech problems to heart disease it&amp;#39;s a mutation in the fxn gene that&amp;#39;s the culprit here this Gene is responsible for producing a protein called fraxin fraxin is crucial for the functioning of mitochondria the powerhouses of our cells but in people with free drot taxia the fxn gene stumbles and falters leading to a significant decrease in F taxin production and when fraxin levels drop our cells can&amp;#39;t produce enough energy leading to the degeneration of nerve and muscle cells especially the ones in our spinal cord and heart the symptoms of frederi ataxia usually begin in childhood or during the teenage years although they can Surface at any age the early ass signs often include difficulty with balance and coordination a condition known as a taxia as the disease progresses it can affect a person&amp;#39;s ability to move their limbs and even speak one of the most severe complications of fredri ataxia is heart disease the lack of fraxin can cause the heart muscle to thicken a condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy this can lead to heart failure which is often the primary cause of premature death in people with this condition now this might sound overwhelming and it is however it&amp;#39;s important to remember that each person&amp;#39;s Journey with freed Drita taxia is unique the progression and severity of symptoms can vary widely among individuals some people might retain the ability to walk for years While others might become wheelchair bound in their teens now that we understand what Frederick a taxia is it&amp;#39;s time to delve deeper into how this condition is passed from one generation to the next genetics play a crucial role in Frederick taxia it&amp;#39;s a tale written in the DNA told through the lives of those affected now let&amp;#39;s delve into the intricacies of this Tale the how and why of this condition&amp;#39;s inheritance you see Frederick Ataxia is an inherited disease but what does that mean well it&amp;#39;s a bit like passing down a family heirloom only this heirloom is nestled within the coiled strands of our DNA Frederick taxia is passed down through what&amp;#39;s known as an autosomal recept Ive pattern to understand this imagine a pair of shoes each of us gets one shoe from each parent to make a complete pair similarly we inherit one copy of each gene from each parent now a person will have frederi taxia only if both genes in this pair have the mutation like having two left shoes this is where a punet square comes into play it&amp;#39;s a simple tool that scientists use to predict the likelihood of an offspring inheriting a certain trait for Frederick a taxia if both parents are carriers each child has has a 1 in4 chance of having the disease a two and4 chance of being a carrier and a one in4 chance of neither having the disease nor being a carrier it&amp;#39;s a bit like rolling a four-sided dice where each side represents a different possible outcome but remember this is just a probability it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that if a couple has four children one will definitely have Frederick taxia it&amp;#39;s more like each child&amp;#39;s individual role of the dice now I know what you might be thinking if both parents must be carriers for a child to have a chance of inheriting Frederick a taxia why is it not more common well that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s relatively rare for both parents to be carriers it&amp;#39;s like trying to find two left shoes in a store full of matching pairs but when it does happen the result is a life marked by the challenges of Frederick a taxia yet the people living with this condition are so much more than their inherited genes they are individuals with dreams hopes and the strength to face each day with Courage the code of Life carries with it both the wonders of of existence and the burdens of conditions like Frederick taxia now let&amp;#39;s explore if there&amp;#39;s a way to rewrite this code living with Frederick taxia is a challenge but Medical Science offers some hope to manage the condition let&amp;#39;s dive in and explore the current treatment options available first and foremost it&amp;#39;s important to know that the primary aim of treatment for Frederick Ataxia is symptomatic relief as we navigate this journey together remember that while we don&amp;#39;t have a cure yet we can still improve quality of life physical therapy plays a significant role in managing symptoms regular exercise helps maintain muscle strength and improve Mobility while also staving off the stiffness that often comes with Frederick a taxia occupational therapy can also be beneficial offering strategies to maintain Independence and continue daily activities it&amp;#39;s not just the physical aspects though speech therapy can help manage the speech difficulties and swallowing problems that

taxia certain drugs can help manage symptoms such as heart problems diabetes and muscle spasms all of which can accompany this condition there are also promising advancements in the field of gene therapy this approach aims to replace the faulty Gene causing Frederick taxia with a healthy one while still in the experimental stages early results are encouraging however it&amp;#39;s important to remember that all treatments come with potential side effects physical therapies can be exhausting and timec consuming and may initially increase muscle soreness medications can have side effects ranging from mild fatigue to more severe complications like organ damage and gene therapy while promising is still in its infancy and comes with unknown long-term effects it&amp;#39;s also worth noting that treatment Effectiveness varies from person person to person what works well for one individual might not work as well for another hence a personalized comprehensive treatment plan

indomitable Frederick Ataxia is a Relentless foe advancing steadily despite our best efforts to Halt its progress you see this disease has a unique characteristic it&amp;#39;s Progressive but what does that mean it means that with the passage of time the symptoms of Frederick taxia don&amp;#39;t just stay static they worsen this is not a disease that you contract and then get better from it&amp;#39;s a condition that entrenches itself deeper with each passing day imagine a snowball rolling down a hill as it rolls it gathers more snow becoming larger and faster that&amp;#39;s how Frederick Ataxia behaves it starts with subtle symptoms like minor difficulties with balance and coordination over time these symptoms become more pronounced eventually leading to the need for Mobility AIDS such as wheelchairs as the disease progresses it starts to impact other areas of the body as well heart disease is a common complication as is diabetes the disease also tends to affect the nervous system leading to issues such as hearing loss slurred speech and difficulty swallowing It&amp;#39;s a cruel reality of this disease that it doesn&amp;#39;t just come and go but rather it

we&amp;#39;re still trying to solve as we&amp;#39;ve explored this disease is a rare inherited neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the nervous system it gradually impairs a person&amp;#39;s ability to walk talk and perform daily tasks The Inheritance pattern of this disease is intriguing it&amp;#39;s caused by a recessive trait meaning both parents must carry the faulty Gene for their child to develop the condition we Illustrated this using a punet square which served as a visual representation of how this re exessive trait is passed down from parents to offspring while we&amp;#39;re on the subject of inheritance it&amp;#39;s worth noting that the disease does not discriminate it affects people of all ethnicities and genders equally in terms of treatment

always just kind of be like well I have fa and they were like what&amp;#39;s fa and I&amp;#39;m like uh I&amp;#39;m not getting into that it started to really show in six grade and I was about 12 years old I remember I would get kind of certain treatment like I always had to have a top Locker because if I had a Locker on the bottom I was not able to easily bend down and use my locker on the bottom so I had to have a top one it was allowed to be late to Glass I didn&amp;#39;t have to participate in P sometimes I and I always use the elevator and not the stairs so I had all of those issues going on on top of nailing with they and when you&amp;#39;re a teenager it&amp;#39;s just so hard to like be different than everyone else for example I remember when I was like 13 years old and there&amp;#39;s this guy and he had a cur on me and he asked me out but when he asked me out he asked me it&amp;#39;s like one of the dances that were coming up and because I had fa I couldn&amp;#39;t go to dances because I couldn&amp;#39;t stand up that long [Music] cuz most dances are mainly spanning and dancing so I didn&amp;#39;t go to those so when this kid asked me out I said no because he asked me to a dance and I could go to dance but at the time being a teenager I was I was too embarrassed like say hey can&amp;#39;t going to dance because of my disability and we knew something else which I a new today but when I was a teenager it was not that easy to just save that I didn&amp;#39;t want to be disabled I didn&amp;#39;t want to be different I I was just trying to be a normal normal teenager I didn&amp;#39;t want to have all of these issues I didn&amp;#39;t want to have a I tried to ignore it I obviously I couldn&amp;#39;t just ignore it but I tried and it was getting more and more noticeable my friends slowly started distancing themselves and I was originally when I was in elementary school and early middle school I was like one of the popular kids and well like by everyone and I had a lot of friends and then I started getting more and more disabled and I started losing those friend and that was not fun it definitely took a toll on me as a person um I thought less of myself I still didn&amp;#39;t really understand why I had fa I didn&amp;#39;t want to have fa I I was just confused and trying my best to fit in even though I very clearly did not fit in I was never bullied to my face directly but I was definitely made fun of behind my back and I knew that and it was difficult to get through especially as a teenager and I also remember my middle school was so big or I thought it was because I was having to walk everywhere walk from class to class and walked all the way across the school which when I had a b that was not easy I remember when school went in all I wanted to do was go home and rest I didn&amp;#39;t want to go out I didn&amp;#39;t want to do any of that any outside activities after school ended because during school it was so much walking and physical effort and it was just hard and I was so tired that was pretty much what I was like for me in in school and as fa progress it started not only getting more difficult for me physically so be in school but it got a lot harder for me socially to fit in and be accepted I wish I was more confident and I disabled self as a teenager that would have made it a lot easier but I was just trying to not be different teenag years not fun for anyone and being disabled on top of that it just sucks it just then and then then I got to high school and I face the new challenge of being in a witer once I got to high school but if you want to hear about that go to part three and I will talk all about high school and FAA and what it was like for me and what it was like starting to use a wheelchair as my disabil progressed and all of that make sure to follow me and watch part three bye",

    "transcript": "Hey guys it&amp;#39;s Natalie again um i just wanted \nto take a minute and shoot an introduction   video for you guys because i know a lot of \nyou have already donated to the GoFundMe   and are kind of familiar with me my story, but \nfor those that aren&amp;#39;t, I know it&amp;#39;s sometimes   easier to watch video than it is to read a \nlong biography on someone. So, here it goes!   So, my life started out in South Florida. \nI was born normally; I was  asymptomatic   until around third grade when i had \na phys ed teacher (phys ed)  teacher   that noticed my gait was off when i ran and \nhow clumsy i was. My grandmother was also   a school teacher and noticed things such as my \nfine motor control and my hand-eye coordination.   So, my parents started doing research \nand taking me to neurologists at Jackson   Memorial in south Florida, but after a few \nmonths, I actually got really tired of it   and started to complain that i was feeling \nlike a guinea pig. Fast forward to the summer   of my fifth grade, hurricane Andrew decided to \ntear my family&amp;#39;s and my life all the way apart.   Our homes were destroyed, my mom and dad&amp;#39;s mine \nand then my grandparents, my dad&amp;#39;s biological   parents was also destroyed; we were separated \nand we all ended up moving to north Florida Once I was in north Florida,   i went on vacation to work with my aunt \nat my uncle&amp;#39;s building um cabinetry   shop, and i began complaining of back \npain when i got back to the house.   my parents decided to take me to an \northopedic doctor to have it checked out   because at this time, they had already \nstarted looking into a researching about    friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia, and \ndoing their research, they realized   that one of the things that happens to \nalmost everyone who has FA is scoliosis So, they took me to an orthopedic doctor at   Shands in Gainesville, and yes, \nI ended up having scoliosis. So, when they found out I had scoliosis, the curve began to curve out, \nlike progressively faster   than the doctors had expected. So, with the next \ncouple of months, I had my first spinal surgery.   They placed harrington rods all the way down \nmy spine. i was probably around 12 and a half,   and then right after the surgery,   i had gone with my next door neighbor, who \nwas an older lady, like middle-aged mom   and um I went with her and her two-year-old \nwho I used to babysit for, to the public fair, and the little girl took off running \nand went to run away from me and her mom,   and being me, just a dumb kid \nmyself but not wanting to let her   get lost or whatever, I went and i grabbed her and \npicked her up, and I ended up popping the entire   top of my harrington rods loose, \nlike above my bra strap. So,   they were protruding almost \nall the way through my skin.   So, back in the hospital I went for me second \nback surgery. Throughout my high school years,   I was extremely creative and dabbled in just \nabout every art medium that you can imagine. I was even in acting and drama clubs and went to statewide competitions Throughout my early college career, I received an associate&amp;#39;s degree in \nmedical assisting. I worked off and on as both an office administrator \nand a medical assistant. So, while i was working, I decided \nto go back to community college. During my time at Santa Fe (SFCC), \ni uh fell and i broke my radius. A few months passed; the radius did not heal.   The fracture did not heal. So, \nthey had to go in and place a plate in my radius. I eventually graduated Santa Fe and was accepted into UF the uh sociology program. So, I made it all the way to my second to last \nsemester, and i started having severe arm pain and developed a very odd knot, \nlike right at the top of the scar. So, I went to the doctor, and they said,  \n&amp;quot;oh you developed a bone infection.   so we have to put you on a pick line \nof antibiotics,&amp;quot; for like three months. So, i said, &amp;quot;okay&amp;quot; So, I got a pick line, and as \nsoon as they did it, I knew something was wrong!   and they were watching it and as they like \nput the pick line in your arm, they watch it   and they were like oh no you&amp;#39;re fine mom \nI was freaking out no something&amp;#39;s wrong so   the next day, i was supposed to have the plate \nremoved, and i went to the hospital, and my dad   was like, &amp;quot;she screamed all day long something \nhas got to be wrong,&amp;quot; so they looked they did an   ultrasound, and sure enough i had i developed a \nblood clot like i think it was like two or three So, I spent the next six months debilitated completely and in bed, and i have no \nidea how, but somehow I ended up graduating from   the UF um sociology program with ba-uh BS. After \ngraduating from UF for the bachelors in sociology ,  the director and assistant director of UF \nHealth Arts in Medicine offered me a position. Halfway through my time of employment,   the director of UF arts in medicine opened up a \nmaster&amp;#39;s degree program in Arts in Medicine. So, I slowly began taking classes while \nworking. Halfway through my master&amp;#39;s degree   program, I met someone, and my life \nchanged completely. um a month after my first son was born, we moved out of my tiny one \nbedroom apartment to his nice big and spacious   spacious family-owned property. Although \nthe house is extremely spacious,   besides a pre-existing wheelchair and bars around \nthe toilet we installed when we first moved in,   the house is not at all accommodated \nfor me or my wheelchair i reached out   to every resource imaginable. \nfor example, habitat for humanity and for one reason or another, they can not assist \n me be it a lack of funding they no longer   work on mobile homes etc. That&amp;#39;s when my postpartum \ntherapist recommended that i do a GoFundMe. I was kind of iffy about this at \nfirst, and Frank was here working   on the doors, and i brought it up to him, \nand he agreed that starting the gofundme   to help me assist in accommodating the \nhouse was a wonderful idea. So, here we are today,   and that concludes the story thus \nfar along. thank you very much for your generosity.",

it&amp;#39;s funny I use it as a like how to know how hungry I am that&amp;#39;s a good I like that or when my friends are trying to make plans we&amp;#39;ve been hanging out all day and I&amp;#39;m like okay how hungry are you so we know like how to plan for the food smart smart I know you said before we started filming that you were scared yeah what do you what what&amp;#39;s scared scary for you right now yes yes yes you&amp;#39;re scary to me you&amp;#39;re literally a therapist um so it&amp;#39;s the therapy thing that scares you not me as a human I hope yeah no you&amp;#39;re lovely you&amp;#39;re delightful it&amp;#39;s what you chosen to do yeah it&amp;#39;s just like your whole career what tell me what&amp;#39;s scary about it CU there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s something experience you&amp;#39;ve had that kind of set that in place um I don&amp;#39;t know I have like a weird um relationship with therapy probably I don&amp;#39;t know when I was 15 or 16 my mom found weed in my room and actually was not mine I didn&amp;#39;t know why but I couldn&amp;#39;t walk when I smoked weed cuz I wasn&amp;#39;t diagnosed back then but I you know it&amp;#39;s gen genetic um so she put me in like addicts therapy for like years really yeah like in high school um and the therapist knew that was not correct but my mom do be like that um but she was cool she was fine I think I just feel like I&amp;#39;ve tried therapy and like I&amp;#39;m kind of seeing it just like this 20s something white girl from Franklin and like it&amp;#39;s hard for me to like open up and be like I have more going on yeah what do you think&amp;#39;s hard about it because that I think that&amp;#39;s a common experience you know that&amp;#39;s why the relationship with the therapist is so important right like finding the right one I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve done that yeah um it probably says more about like my attachment style to people like I&amp;#39;m a void as [ __ ] so when I&amp;#39;m like and put me in a box like it&amp;#39;s probably cuz I put myself there and refus to let them open the box well good therapist still recognize that and help you help you push into it have you ever had someone that you connected with therapy wise no really yeah how many have you been to like three different therapists mhm like how long did you stay with one what do you the one was forced by my mom and then the other two were like during Co times yeah like Zoom or whatever um and it&amp;#39;s just so [ __ ] hard to like yeah look at the screen and be like you care about what happens to me you know mhm yeah well you are you currently saying somebody no well if you need to get connected I can help okay all right I have a dollar if you want I&amp;#39;m just trying to give away my money yeah see you didn&amp;#39;t try that before briy connection it&amp;#39;s working um yeah you said just a minute ago that you weren&amp;#39;t diagnosed so can you talk about what that diagnosis is my beautiful friend Fiona yes oh my God so I have a genetic Progressive genetic disease called fre Axia mhm um and it affects like every muscle in your body and it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s not like my muscles wither away or anything but like my proprioception which is like what tells you where your feet are when you&amp;#39;re walking or like you know stuff like that is you know it&amp;#39;s like nerves are all dying and so yeah yeah do you have experienced a lot of anxiety um I didn&amp;#39;t know it was anxiety until recently but yeah I get like sick yeah well you&amp;#39;re constantly trying to figure out like your your body awareness in space like when you are constantly you&amp;#39;re trying to figure that out it it&amp;#39;s that you it can create anxiety like in the body interesting another fun side effect no I love it it&amp;#39;s good um but yeah yes how long have you been diagnosed with that uh I got diagnosed when I was 18 and I&amp;#39;m 26 now wow has it been fast progressing uh yeah it&amp;#39;s weird cuz it didn&amp;#39;t feel like it like you mind if I like back up to okay for it so okay I&amp;#39;m 15 um I was an athlete you know every sport you can think of I was really goodh uh and then I hit high school and something felt like off and I quit Sports and was like all right I&amp;#39;m gonna be an artist now you know what I mean and my mom was like go you&amp;#39;re angsty that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening and I was like word [ __ ] off mom dude it get so so so things start going weird like [ __ ] like I would go to school like I was walking but the principal would like smell my breath for alcohol CU everyone thought I was drunk because of I speak and walk oh wow and so I was like maybe I am drunk like I was so confused and I go my mom be like something is wrong and she would like yell at me and saying like I&amp;#39;m a middle child surging for attention cuz my older sister had medical issues like scoliosis and she walked weird and they were like you&amp;#39;re just copying her and I thought maybe I was like I was losing my mind and then at 18 I like took myself to an ENT cuz I thought maybe equilibrium problem and then they were like no and I went and got a balance test done and I didn&amp;#39;t know what that was um sorry what&amp;#39;s an ENT an ear nose and throat doctor so I really thought that um it was just like in my ears like something was off like I was searching for answers before college cuz I thought it would get fixed and start my life yeah exactly and how old were you when you were taking yourself to 18 I yeah I was I&amp;#39;m old from my grade so I was a senior in high school um and then balanced as nothing they sent me to a neurologist and this dude was [ __ ] stoked cuz that was like his doctor house [Music] moment man my men you know what I mean um but he was like you either have a genetic disease or a tumor on your cerebellum which is a part of your brain that deals with coordination I think I and I was like [ __ ] tumor you know what I mean like take that [ __ ] out and let let&amp;#39;s get back to work um that is not what happened but I got my mom involved when the diagnosis came back cuz basically I was like here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve been doing your insurance doesn&amp;#39;t pay for these tests or whatever will you pay for it she was like if I pay for this you have to shut the [ __ ] up about it and I was like okay and then I was right so I was like really excited to be right mhm and didn&amp;#39;t realize how much it would [ __ ] the rest of my life so now we&amp;#39;re here mhm say when you say you didn&amp;#39;t know how it would [ __ ] the rest of your life up we talk more about that yeah um I I thought it was like like a quirky trait like personality trait I really didn&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d ever be in a wheelchair I just thought I&amp;#39;d be wobbly and like that cute clumsy girl in the &amp;#39;90s [ __ ] realm comes I took it too far I took it too far I know that now I see the error in my [Laughter] way okay so let&amp;#39;s I want to Pivot just a little bit here because you&amp;#39;re talking about some really hard stuff and you&amp;#39;re you know I mentioned ear you&amp;#39;re very good at just naturally making fun of the situation at hand you&amp;#39;re not forcing a joke but that the reason why we are you know creating these conversations because it&amp;#39;s humor is a huge part of how people deal with it um so can you speak to that like how has you being able to make light of like the hard stuff that you deal with that natural that makes helps us get through things right how have you how have you experienced that where maybe it&amp;#39;s been helpful maybe it&amp;#39;s been you&amp;#39;ve noticed it keeps me from kind of looking at some deeper things that are hard um I that&amp;#39;s definitely true uh but I think you know I&amp;#39;ve been using humor as a cing mechanism for years before this like even as a kid yeah um cuz you know everyone&amp;#39;s family is [ __ ] up but mine included uh so yeah I&amp;#39;ve always been like look over here don&amp;#39;t look at this [ __ ] up thing I don&amp;#39;t I feel like I&amp;#39;m not answering that well um no you&amp;#39;re you are um yeah I think I specifically do that because I&amp;#39;m so uncomfortable about things that I want everyone else to be comfortable and now it&amp;#39;s like transferred to like how I exist as a human I have to constantly do a [ __ ] dance for everyone so they don&amp;#39;t feel bad for me me yeah and it&amp;#39;s exhausting but I&amp;#39;m getting better at being less like codependent in my use of it maybe yeah I think so well I think that&amp;#39;s a pretty neat um awareness that you have but then it&amp;#39;s almost like you said at really young age you learn to do that before you were in a wheelchair and so then this other life thing happens and it like transfers and magnifies because you&amp;#39;ve already developed it as a skill right mhm and so skills are helpful right we we they come because we need them um but then what&amp;#39;s where&amp;#39;s the the downside of having that really useful skill where&amp;#39;s the downside well I don&amp;#39;t see one well I feel like you you already kind you already kind of named it where you were like in a wheelchair I have to feel like I have to do a dance so people don&amp;#39;t feel sorry for me that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m paying attention valuing other people&amp;#39;s feelings and thoughts and emotions over you probably learned to do that way before you&amp;#39;re in a wheelchair no absolutely um I think I think doing it so often has like kind of like skewed my sense of my own reality maybe like I don&amp;#39;t really give myself a lot of time to kind of take a beat and like sit with what&amp;#39;s happening happing you know what I mean like it&amp;#39;s just like be funny don&amp;#39;t think about it yeah is that like when you&amp;#39;ve when it first started to get uh maybe when you were like oh [ __ ] I need to get I have to have a wheelchair like in the beginning were you like making jokes or like what was it like in the beginning when it first like got serious serious um and like like after diagnosis I seriously was act like I wasn&amp;#39;t acting like someone that had just been diagnosed with like a [ __ ] life altering disease like I was it was like my party trick like I used it as a conversation Point like it was again just like a quirky cute thing I had um that made me different you know like I&amp;#39;d always be like yeah everyone says they&amp;#39;re one a million but I&amp;#39;m like one four million you&amp;#39;re like damn that joke was good it&amp;#39;s a good joke cut that [ __ ] um so you didn&amp;#39;t like have a moment where it was like just anger like um I okay I do actually it was my it was a week before my 21st birthday yeah um I was still walking around and I lived in a house and my roommate was at work I had gotten up and went to the kitchen to make coffee and I was wearing socks on hardwood floor like a [ __ ] sociopath um anyways that&amp;#39;s Li and I face planted the hardwood and knocked my front tooth out through my lip this is fake what yeah wow and there was blood everywhere I had to take shots out of straws on my 21st it was no that&amp;#39;s the bad thing that came from that so I learned a lesson straws for at first you meant like medicine I did too you&amp;#39;re like no to get wasted no I still bu I&amp;#39;m [Laughter] [Music] fun that&amp;#39;s so funny no it was [Laughter] fear so it that that made what you were talking about like being pissed off that moment was like yeah cuz I like really I just wanted to be like a basic college party girl like that was my and then all a sudden like the only I didn&amp;#39;t have an an excuse for that cuz people would ask me a lot in college like you know has this affect your dayto day especially in like dating yeah when I was first diagnosed I would do my best to play this down because I want to scare men off yeah um you know like I I dated this guy or the guy I was dating when I got diagnosed oh my God he his um Mom and I were close and we went over to tell her what was up cuz she was like kind of woman trying to like heal me with crystals and [ __ ] like it was hard it was hard to bite my tongue anyways wow oh yeah she was trying to heal you yeah but before I got diagnosed she was like I think I know you need I don&amp;#39;t know what to about crystals they even give one example rubies rubies I think that&amp;#39;s in the Bible maybe but like she we&amp;#39;re all sitting we&amp;#39;re all sitting at the table and he&amp;#39;s like telling her what the diagnosis was and what that means for my future and like right across from me she puts her hand like over her mouth and goes you need to break up with their I will not have disabled grandkids and that was like the the first week and I&amp;#39;m 18 like I&amp;#39;m [ __ ] holy [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s a big that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a big moment oh yeah how did that feel um well back then I really thought I like wanted to be a mom and like when I got diagnosed the first question I asked was like would I give this to a kid and I was super grateful because no whoever I had a baby with would have to get genetic tested see if they were curious whatever um so that that stung and I think that like kind of started my fear of people like understanding how bad this was going to get yeah you know mhm yeah that&amp;#39;s hard too because like you said you were close with her and you also had like a hard relationship with your mom so it&amp;#39;s like what grown woman is going to be [ __ ] here for me right like I didn&amp;#39;t trust like adult men or women like there was no I don&amp;#39;t know it was the craziest part though back to diagnosis I got this diagnosis my mom was like oh [ __ ] cuz my whole life she gaset the F like gaset me to Pieces that&amp;#39;s not a say um and then they were like what&amp;#39;s wrong with your sister cuz she walked weird too and so she immediately got tested and she is the same [ __ ] thing so what no I&amp;#39;m just feeling with you I&amp;#39;m like I was like it&amp;#39;s it cuz I kill her in a joke I was like are you mad at me are you mad at no I&amp;#39;m not mad at you um yeah but yeah so I you know so how your sister getting diagnosed with it that how what&amp;#39;s the difference between your age four years and she younger she&amp;#39;s older older yeah has that felt positive that you have someone that oh my God yeah like knows what you&amp;#39;re going through like I would give anything for not to have it but like I really don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;d like be able to do any of the things I&amp;#39;ve done in my life without like someone to bounce [ __ ] off of that like understands like I can complain to her about very Niche problems you know what I mean and she gets it yeah no she&amp;#39;s like my number one I [ __ ] love my sister it&amp;#39;s so interestes like before they didn&amp;#39;t know that she what she had but everybody was just like she has something and then with you well she the thing is nothing happened to me like like I wasn&amp;#39;t in an accident I didn&amp;#39;t have like a big surger surgery like nothing like that my sister had severe scoliosis had surgery for that when she was young and so they kind of as she got worse they put it off on other things she like fell off a mountain one time and like a fun way so nonchalant like the &amp;#39;90s girl she had your &amp;#39;90s girl moment no she was she was a saurin you know what I mean stupid did she say she was soring off the mountain okay play high you know what I mean um but then that happened and they kept blaming [ __ ] on and nothing happened to me so they were like you are copying her and I was like am I I used like practice walking in my room was like in high school cuz I was like I&amp;#39;m [ __ ] crazy and I can&amp;#39;t stop like yeah that&amp;#39;s a lot bro you do a lot of Yeah you mentioned the word gaslighting that&amp;#39;s a lot of that sounds like how your mom responded to things but do you feel like you do that to yourself yeah yeah um it&amp;#39;s I mean I don&amp;#39;t trust any anything I think or say is true like I need other people to verify um but like I can&amp;#39;t blame myself for that you know what I mean like I&amp;#39;m yeah but that&amp;#39;s where that came from yeah that&amp;#39;s you think about your mom&amp;#39;s the first human you have relationship with it&amp;#39;s how you learn how to be in relationship with yourself in the world and so look at your mom and I would think a lot of the ways you patterns you have would make a lot of sense when you&amp;#39;re like this is what I learned from absolutely absolutely she it&amp;#39;s been she [ __ ] up a lot and she knows that like I&amp;#39;ve been able to be like very honest with her like now about like how all these things affect me and she feels terrible and she&amp;#39;s in therapy working on herself which is nice yeah you know um but yeah yeah she&amp;#39;s a good like Mom to adults I think but as a kid she&amp;#39;s you know like uh always working was never her home like that kind of thing you know yeah that&amp;#39;s a lot it&amp;#39;s so it&amp;#39;s so much too to be that age and going through that and like I don&amp;#39;t know there&amp;#39;s just so much you&amp;#39;re like a you&amp;#39;re strong dog that&amp;#39;s a lot going self advocacy to like take yourself to the doctor at 18 and to like keep keep trying to figure it out yeah I mean I think about it now it&amp;#39;s funny because like you know I was so mad at my mom like that&amp;#39;s what fueled me cuz I was like I&amp;#39;m [ __ ] right about something you know yeah but in reality if she would have taken me and got me tested when I was 15 and I first started complaining MH I would not be who I am today cuz I like was given 18 years of feeling like I had the whole world in front of me and I like and I&amp;#39;m grateful for that like cuz you know it&amp;#39;s all kind of been downhill for a while and that&amp;#39;s like been a hard thing to wrap my mind around don&amp;#39;t think I really have um but like her gap setting me I&amp;#39;m a little grateful men disregard that last comment you don&amp;#39;t do it right okay let women do it you Gaslight with care or not at [Laughter] all well talk more about that why why you feel grateful for that um because I okay so I&amp;#39;ve been in a lot of like clinical Zs where I&amp;#39;ve met other people with my disease at different stages blah blah I met a lot of younger people that are you know same severity as me but they have like CT themselves of what they&amp;#39;re capable of doing on their own because they were diagnosed young and so their mom and they feel like they can&amp;#39;t do anything by themselves so they kind of they all live with their parents they don&amp;#39;t have jobs they can go to school and I I wasn&amp;#39;t like given the opportunity to feel bad for myself before I like committed to like trying to do something um so it almost what I&amp;#39;m hearing is like the earlier diagnosis like just starts putting blinders on like what you feel like is possible so sometime I would imagine someone diagnosed younger they&amp;#39;re not going to I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s difficult but there&amp;#39;s like a a loss and a grieving to be done when you have this whole sense of future yeah you have to let go of like that that dreaming and idea of whatever that was that&amp;#39;s real I mean I went into college as a painting and drawing major um but but because of this disease my hands don&amp;#39;t work the way they used to so I switch to graphic design cuz I thought I can press buttons forever like look at Stephen Hawkings you know what I mean oh okay [Laughter] um yeah [ __ ] I lost my drain of thought um but you de grieve losing the idea of a future you might have yeah yeah that just changed but I also didn&amp;#39;t ever see like comedy in my future um so I don&amp;#39;t know I love graphic design I&amp;#39;m glad I you know got a degree in that I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m still doing that um but yeah yeah I think just learning how to like pivot and not like fully let go of what you want but like making it work for you yeah I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m interested in that because you were like oh I didn&amp;#39;t lose or I still had that these like dreams until it started to go downhill how did you turn it around when it went downhill like how do you stay so you&amp;#39;re already laughing you&amp;#39;re like what what are you going to say positive and just like how did you shift to being like I&amp;#39;m still going to be motivated and uh make dreams for myself how did you do that oh man um I think as oh [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s a hard question um like as I&amp;#39;ve progressed in the this disease I I&amp;#39;ve like what I want for my future is changed at each stage because like I I will say like as shitty as this is for my body obviously like the perspective I&amp;#39;ve gained is you know I wouldn&amp;#39;t trade that honestly um I was a [ __ ] before this you know you were a [ __ ] oh I&amp;#39;m like oh what well yeah I was the I was a bully come me the [ __ ] wobbly bit Yeah I was kind of Weeble [ __ ] okay I&amp;#39;m done um Weeble [ __ ] on those um I am what&amp;#39;s the perspective shift that happened the perspective shift um yeah I think so I&amp;#39;m from Franklin you know the area a lot of wasps out there um it is you know what I mean so I was very like like vain in the things I thought mattered do not matter to me anymore yeah um and I think I was just like willing to like care about things that have more longevity you you know what I mean like developing friendships and like your personality and understanding how to listen to people and like human things um pretty cool but yeah I think my perspective on what matters and like what gives a person value mhm has completely changed and I&amp;#39;m happy for that no yeah those are yeah those are great things that come from the perspect like you said it&amp;#39;s just a perspective where you it&amp;#39;s just very unique one that you have and it seems like you were able to shift from feeling like this was like something that caused an issue that you had to make up or apologize for for some reason that something felt ended up being very empowering and helping you grow in ways you didn&amp;#39;t know you could or or should or whatever you know right no that is absolutely true um you know I&amp;#39;m a glass half full kind of girl so try to keep it that way you that&amp;#39;s hard that that&amp;#39;s a hard attitude for anybody to keep but especially the support where you speak a little bit to it seems like there&amp;#39;s a lack of support as a young person yeah what does your support look like now I have friends that&amp;#39;s a very cool um but you have supported friends yes I do I actually I recently had to end a couple friendships that were like from my past that I had brought like when you let history kind of like a shackle you to a person regardless of like you know what&amp;#39;s actually there how much you have in common or if they&amp;#39;re good for your life so I had to end a couple of friendships recently and I&amp;#39;m really happy to say that like the women I keep in my circle now are just like all amazing people you know will you talk a little bit because I&amp;#39;m imagine there&amp;#39;s people that are listening um that that are in those positions where we&amp;#39;ve had friends like friends or family like they&amp;#39;re built in we have these obligations to the or loyalties to the relationships but they&amp;#39;re not healthy and as we grow as humans we realize where we we need to put some more in per to us um what what did you notice about the friends that whatever you knew you saw or experienced where they need to kind of be more peripheral and these friends that are really supportive if you just you&amp;#39;re looking character of person or how you experiened the relationship yeah I mean this is like very specific to me um but like those friends always found a way when we were out or they came over anything anytime I was around them to like slip in the fact that they like think I&amp;#39;m a burden or like like God this is so annoying I have to like help with your wheelchair like [ __ ] like that like yeah or they&amp;#39;d invite me because they wanted to get to the front of the line or I have good parking you know did they say that oh yeah but they thought like we were cool enough for them to talk to me like that so it&amp;#39;s like it was hidden for a while well yeah well you get you I think in those moments tell me if this if is something you experience you have you&amp;#39;re choosing in those moments like do I laugh and go along or put up with this hurt or do I lose this connection with my perceived friends right um and for years I did the Laughing going I just like I thought quantity over quality yeah was important cuz I like wanted to be someone with a bunch of friends but like it&amp;#39;s funny CU like as I like ended those friendships like it made room for so many better people and so like yeah I just I think like when you realize if you&amp;#39;re in trouble you can&amp;#39;t call that person like they wouldn&amp;#39;t help you because that would be inconvenient to them and yeah that includes family like I just don&amp;#39;t think like time or history makes you ow anyone anything yeah yeah so and talk about the qualities of the friends that are around you now um they like for example they literally just came over and like painted the inside of my house for me why you tell them yes um they I don&amp;#39;t know like I can call okay so I told you I do this like dance keep everyone happy got to keep it light like I don&amp;#39;t talk about my disability much around people that I don&amp;#39;t think can handle it but like any of the friends I have now like I get sad a couple times a month where I just like break down about what&amp;#39;s happening yeah and I could could call those people and they would like sit there and listen to me for hours you know yeah and I have never really had that yeah that feels good a bet MH really good so not being an inconvenience that it seems like there&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the Stark difference with how you feel in those different ones do you feel and when you think about your mom and how she responded and showed up in this do you think did she give you that sense that you you were like a burden to her inconvenience yeah I mean both of my parents did you know like growing up that was definitely the vibe like anytime I was upset or wanted to talk about something it was always oh my God you&amp;#39;re such a middle child and it&amp;#39;s like you made me one true she could have stopped you know I&amp;#39;m just kidding I love my brother um um yeah yeah but with her I think like the root of why she was like so dismissive to these things she didn&amp;#39;t want anything to be wrong with her kid and so she was like you know if we don&amp;#39;t put a name to it it doesn&amp;#39;t exist yeah I mean how many how how many of us do that with all different kinds of things but right yeah it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s okay you know that that&amp;#39;s how it should go but yeah just like trying to understand it yeah not be okay with it but like it sounds like you&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of work I watch a lot of Tik Tok please edit that part out Tik Tok is my doctor Tik Tock is my doctor my doctor no further questions is that really like I&amp;#39;m just going to do this this I just want to get this out of your face but is yeah you get a lot of info from Tik Tok I know melan&amp;#39;s like stop this no no I&amp;#39;m just kidding I&amp;#39;m well everybody has ADHD at this point oh my God I&amp;#39;m like am I autistic maybe yes you know I have there I have noticed an uptick in like young people like questioning like bringing that in and wondering wow because I&amp;#39;m what I experienced as the therapist is that we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re just disconnected or we grew up in environments where we weren&amp;#39;t we weren&amp;#39;t able to interact with emotions and talk about them and understand them and so we are we weren&amp;#39;t exposed to like social things and then we go through Co that mimics any of that trauma that we have that we bring it up and we are repl our nervous system doesn&amp;#39;t have a time like a clock on it so it&amp;#39;s experiencing it again so we&amp;#39;re all now trying to reconnect again and everybody&amp;#39;s like I think what was it somebody was saying when you get on the phone with somebody now you&amp;#39;re kind like what you know it&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;re talking over each other we are all having to reorient back and if you&amp;#39;re prone to always guessing for yourself like it&amp;#39;s me something&amp;#39;s wrong with me and we try finding a label has helped then I think that&amp;#39;s what you know just the understanding part and so ADHD the symptoms overlap with so many things so many trauma response stuff that it it it can you can experience it just like true ADHD but I think it stops you there when you when you label like almost it&amp;#39;s a perfect example what you&amp;#39;re saying you&amp;#39;re like I didn&amp;#39;t have this label and so I wasn&amp;#39;t limiting what I could think and do and I think sometimes we get so many labels um and in a need to try to understand or validate oursel when we just know we are who we are and we we don&amp;#39;t need validation from anything external but we&amp;#39;re programmed in a way to seek that out but kind of puts these blocks for us to really I don&amp;#39;t think anything I think it&amp;#39;s great to like get the label get the information you need but like yeah to limit yourself based off that I do say that constantly and and is really hard for me to sit there and act empathetic towards stuff like that like the amount of times someone with ADD has come up to me and said like ah I understand what I&amp;#39;m not kidding this [ __ ] happens all the time or some [ __ ] with like a sprained ankle you&amp;#39;re like I&amp;#39;ve had both okay I&amp;#39;m like a brained anle in human form really a girl came up with a spring ankle yes this happened last weekend at Rosemary how do you respond to that I get very angry now I used to be like ha and now I&amp;#39;ll be like [ __ ] you do you say [ __ ] you for you oh yeah yeah I&amp;#39;ve like lost my ability until I do this social nice like they need to [ __ ] know cuz like you know not everyone&amp;#39;s as strong as me so you&amp;#39;re laughing but we&amp;#39;re like no but it&amp;#39;s true no own that power don&amp;#39;t discount it it&amp;#39;s yours my nails aren&amp;#39;t even painted girl mine never well I mean to do I was like calling back to something that was set off camera and I just realized mightbe might be may be um what like obviously people say stupid [ __ ] to you a lot because you have that in your comedy too um I well what&amp;#39;s like like I don&amp;#39;t know I guess people saying stupid [ __ ] yes but is there like an opposite of that where people are like oh like that guy who was like does she need help in the bathroom oh my God also kill yourself like that oh are people are like yes can you come right for me sorry sorry sorry I didn&amp;#39;t mean sorry sorry um now like the [ __ ] worst is people will constantly and like I&amp;#39;m tired of being like oh they had good intentions no no and when people are like how how do I know when to help you mhm I&amp;#39;ll ask when I [ __ ] ask I&amp;#39;m an adult I pay taxes kind of I you know what I mean so it&amp;#39;s like yeah like I would rather someone be like really rude to me than be this like fake Southern nice I want to get into heaven thing that makes me Furious I will always be meaner in the face of that like I kind of got some respect for someone who can be publicly rude to someone in a wheelchair that&amp;#39;s kind of dope [ __ ] yeah I mean hell yeah get your bag you know what I mean wait did you get paid for that know that I&amp;#39;m just trying to be trendy get your back bab get your back [ __ ] okay um go off king um I I love you so much I think you&amp;#39;re cool and strong and smart and funny same may I ask your like can you tell me about like the relationship with your body like before I love when you already start laughing and smiling you&amp;#39;re like I&amp;#39;m about to tell a joke like I&amp;#39;m uncomfortable I&amp;#39;m having a good time you don&amp;#39;t have to no no no go keep will you rephrase it yeah like [Music] H my so my relationship with my body like before and now yeah before like you knew what the diagnosis was was and then when you knew and what that meant for the future like I guess just like you spend a lot of time being like am I crazy am I crazy and then your body was like oh this is what we&amp;#39;re doing we have this how did that make you feel towards your body oh my god um I honestly I think like well again I [ __ ] celebrate ated being right like that was like my immediate response was I was stoked to be right for the first time it felt like a relief from being like gaset but you&amp;#39;re like see I know me right right I was like I&amp;#39;m aware of things you know I back to every job that fired me for falling down flights of stairs and stuff and I told them that was very fun [ __ ] froy monkey I will never drink their coffee again yeah [ __ ] him they sound a liability um I [Music] was they didn&amp;#39;t have to like say it you have to say it like that wait that&amp;#39;s before they knew that you had yeah I was I worked there in high school when I was 18 so I was waiting for the test results it takes three months for them to come back so they were just based on in their perception some when that&amp;#39;s clumsy yeah they thought I was or accident drunk or stoned all the time yeah but customers love me so they had to get a food Runner when I worked so someone could carry my [ __ ] um but it was when I cleared off a bunch of tables and I was going down the stairs and I fell and everything broke and I was pretty gnarly I had diagnosed like 2 weeks later though and I they were like don&amp;#39;t sue us you know what I mean I love the shoulder shrug I got up anyways you know I wasn&amp;#39;t diagnosed yet but I can&amp;#39;t tell if when I look at you if it&amp;#39;s like bad for audio no okay cool sorry I feel like I&amp;#39;ve been side eyeing you this whole time so you were all like after you were like I&amp;#39;m right you just like your mindset was like all right let&amp;#39;s keep going let&amp;#39;s do this yeah like nothing had changed changed like I honestly coping mechanism I think I was just pretending not to understand what it really meant like I thought this makes me more interesting this gives me an answer to why I walk this way and I get to go and shove the [ __ ] in everyone&amp;#39;s face you know what I mean um and so I was just like on a high for probably the first like year and a half of like feeling validated yeah and then I realized that oh now I got to deal with this yeah I&amp;#39;m like oh but it&amp;#39;s really happening yeah you know what I mean like I like thought it was on pause for some reason cuz the thing about like having a progressive disease it&amp;#39;s like very strange because it&amp;#39;s not like I wake up and like I&amp;#39;m like okay I know how to be disabled like this every day is different every day harder and so I&amp;#39;m never a master at my own body you know what I mean yeah that&amp;#39;s a good way to put it because a lot of it&amp;#39;s like you can wrap your head around things easier when you&amp;#39;re like okay I know what I have to deal with and how this all works but it&amp;#39;s a continual thing every day of like what&amp;#39;s going to what you have to deal with right it&amp;#39;s a roller coaster and I do have like good and bad days like physically um at what point did you have to um did you become like wheelchair like bount yeah um about two years ago yeah yeah so so but that was a big shift when that happened yeah yeah it was I mean I had a walker before the wheelchair someone at uh mik told me that a wheelchair was way hotter than a walker I was like word that&amp;#39;s why I did it so um I mean honestly so I went from walking and I couldn&amp;#39;t get served at bars because they all thought I was [ __ ] up and I&amp;#39;d be like no I have this and they be like we&amp;#39;ve heard that one before I&amp;#39;m like where um and then I had like canes which was really cool face I had different canes for every album like I was really intense about it like I still have like 14 gains and so I like hide them all over my anyways um wait finish that s all over my house I bet that you my birthday I have that sword [Laughter] cane blind I went on a blind date one time and he showed up flowers and a canee with a sword inside for me oh that was pretty awesome I never went out with M but let me keep the cane and it was very cool that&amp;#39;s so cool I love that he&amp;#39;s a nice guy and that&amp;#39;s why he had to go yeah I had to [ __ ] go a little Edge me bit what you like you mentioned you like people that are publicly mean to people in wheelchairs yeah that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m looking for you know what I mean like is that too much to ask like be awful like you&amp;#39;re already doing it behind Clos door fcking bringing into the street Big Daddy Big Daddy well kind of tell us how you you found your way to Comedy it wasn&amp;#39;t something you had your sights on and thought could you know would be something you did so how did no I hadn&amp;#39;t even considered that that was like a thing um so uh so I was dating a piece of [ __ ] okay um and and I think I had like gone to Zan&amp;#39;s to like watch some shows and it&amp;#39;s not like I was like I could do that but like I was like I want to try that would be cool and funny and conversation maybe you know and I told this dude I was dating that I thought was going to go and open mic or something and he told me not to and he was like it&amp;#39;ll be embarrassing for you and me and I don&amp;#39;t need that so we broke up good um and this was years ago okay um we broke up and then I Marvel&amp;#39;s Miss masel wasn&amp;#39;t even out yet okay okay let me prep it please I have that&amp;#39;s a Time marker I got really drunk on Valentine&amp;#39;s Day mhm okay um and I show up to a house party and I had told my friends like I think I want to try but I&amp;#39;m scared and I found out my friend was having this house party she had bands like it was packed and she had put on the flyer standup comedian F col and I was pissed and very drunk and a good combination I mean and I had no material like I didn&amp;#39;t I was like okay um and I sat in a chair very similar yours like a comfy chair like 50 people sat on the ground of this house okay it was like story time oh my God and I just [ __ ] talked my ex-boyfriend and I crushed yeah there you go and then I was like I&amp;#39;ll never do it again and I was so scared it was so scar I was like that was random and then I went to Atlanta for a clinical trial and you know they pay for your stay your food all that [ __ ] so I went out with a friend we&amp;#39;re bar hopping the night before this trial I&amp;#39;m an idiot they took a lot of blood I was not okay um and I was like I want to watch some comedy we go to the punchline um someone couldn&amp;#39;t make it so they were like we&amp;#39;re doing a bucket spot I didn&amp;#39;t know what a bucket spot was and they explained and my friend was like and I was like no absolutely not I go to the bathroom like ring idiot and I come back she&amp;#39;s pulling the name p colie and I was like what and she was like I didn&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;d pull you and I was piss drunk again and I get on stage I don&amp;#39;t remember what I said but they invited me back it was very cool yeah and then I didn&amp;#39;t do it again for years and then Co happened and I didn&amp;#39;t do it during Co and then finally my roommate at the time jlyn [ __ ] shout out um she forced me to try and open mic and I went to the EAS room October this past October um and I did that mic and got bucked on my first show after my first mic back wow that&amp;#39;s so exciting it was cool the third time what made you be like okay I&amp;#39;m going to do this because those other two you were like no because I started getting forced to honestly I was like one and done baby but then I started getting like booked on more and more shows and I was like I guess I have to keep doing this one out I&amp;#39;m like I&amp;#39;m literally being held a gum boy right now no I love it so much and I was just so scared the fear kept me from it and I used to have to drink before I went on stage and now I can do it sober which is crazy that&amp;#39;s awesome I love that that&amp;#39;s so dope Yeah well yeah do you feel like the doing it those few times when when it was just it wasn&amp;#39;t planned you just did did it and it was fun that would it keep did you want to kind of keep that as like a sacred experience by like starting yeah like I was a t to yeah yeah like it wasn&amp;#39;t a job it was like a random thing that now I can tell people I&amp;#39;ve done standed up before I was like that&amp;#39;s pretty interesting and cool but now I&amp;#39;m just like a fullblown narcissist you are not a narcissist she&amp;#39;s had to tell a couple like wait say it again you are not a [Laughter] narcissist oh how does it feel to talk about you like your condition you being in a wheelchair all that on stage like did people they do they laugh do they not laugh do you love it when they don&amp;#39;t laugh oh my god when they don&amp;#39;t laugh I get really angry I finally started acknowledging how angry it makes me when I get the oh like you&amp;#39;re a [ __ ] comedy show if I hear that again I&amp;#39;ll will throw myself out of this chair do you say that out loud yeah for sure I want to come to one of your shows when are you playing around here next Saturday I&amp;#39;m there oh the blue room it&amp;#39;s an abortion caran fund Riser wait what the Blue Room plug it well it won&amp;#39;t matter by the time this airs never mind okay well never mind cut even past your show yeah yeah keep caring so Saturday at the Blue Room yeah okay that&amp;#39;s fun that&amp;#39;s cool hell yeah what time uh sorry I need to stop sorry there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s times where you get you forget we&amp;#39;re like recording a podcast we&amp;#39;re just talking umu seven or eight probably yeah yeah sorry um a question again I feel like about talking about your oh right um yes I I think like I already knew how to make it like an approachable subject cuz I&amp;#39;ve been like doing that for so long I didn&amp;#39;t know if like a large group of people would be into that or if just make everyone too sad you know what I mean but I make this ability look fun you crush dude yeah you&amp;#39;re great no than go um no yeah do you feel like you give enough room to the the difficult stuff because you&amp;#39;re really good at making it fun and like standing in like stepping into the the parts that help have expanded you as a person do you give enough to the hard part like enough space for for that you think I absolutely not I&amp;#39;m going to say no to that one um yeah no no I I think I don&amp;#39;t and hopefully at some point I&amp;#39;ll figure it out to but I&amp;#39;m scared if I do it&amp;#39;ll kind of kill some of the like fun spins I have going on you know like I don&amp;#39;t want to pop that bubble for my myself CU what if I stop finding the humor in this well that yeah I think that&amp;#39;s the huge Spotlight of this podcast is that I think comedians think they have to be one or the other there&amp;#39;s not room for both of those that it seems like your identity or Worth or how good of a comedian you are rest in your ability to be funny even if it means being funny about the hard stuff it&amp;#39;s like a when I think it&amp;#39;s a double thing of way that you work through the experience you know or work with it or interact with it in some way that feels tolerable right but it it can also lend it to being a thing that kind of pushes that over to the side a lot do you mean handling it on a stage or in like personal either or like just like what she said if I if I sit with the the pain or the hard stuff I&amp;#39;ll lose my ability to be funny about this and and make disability look good right that&amp;#39; be fun just marketing 101 see jokes I can be serious I can do it but when you&amp;#39;re so good at it I mean it&amp;#39;s a skill you lean into it you know that that is a fear though I don&amp;#39;t want to be not funny yeah then you start that well I would say notice that you the belief is that you have to pick one or the other you don&amp;#39;t Fiona&amp;#39;s not convinced maybe it would make it even funnier I feel like we&amp;#39;ve had this conversation before about some darker things that I talk about if I like you know healed from it and then was I was able to look at it from more sides you know you know what I will say the weirdest thing to me um I there&amp;#39;s one thing I can&amp;#39;t talk about on stage I&amp;#39;ve tried I no everyone&amp;#39;s always like we feel bad for you this is just dad my [ __ ] dad I try there are so many jokes I can make and I know how to make jokes I know how to you know can&amp;#39;t [ __ ] do it um so I think there is some truth in like accepting or understanding something before you can bring it to a stage what happens when you try um I literally I told a story about him MH Dead Silence um which does not feel good and then I got off stage and some of the comics were like yeah I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re ready to talk about that cuz like you seem hurt wow and I was like okay [ __ ] you too like so you hurt you no pain throw myself out of this chair bro W say you did it long-term pain you&amp;#39;re going to jail bro some legal pain [ __ ] that did give me a chill though when they were like I think you&amp;#39;re I was like oh [ __ ] now that makes sense yeah they can still they can see your pain in it yeah they can smell it can I ask a question from as someone not in the comedic because it&amp;#39;s been it&amp;#39;s fun getting to hang out with like a room of comedians um it&amp;#39;s very the energy is very different from what I do all day but what&amp;#39;s the um I just lost my train of thought pain seeing pain in a joke oh okay from the outside perspective being able to it seems like there&amp;#39;s a thing about like it&amp;#39;s just a known thing that comedians bring like like someone said you&amp;#39;re not ready for that yet you&amp;#39;re still so it&amp;#39;s like they knew you bring your pain to the stage is that a thing um yeah I would say and honestly you okay this is personal opinion this is not fact um but for me to like enjoy another comedian&amp;#39;s comedy I want to feel like I know something about you and I think people that have seen success like this [ __ ] she is good at like she does the whole like here&amp;#39;s some real sh sh but I&amp;#39;m going to make it approachable MH but there are a lot of comedians who are like not like clearly not diving into their own stuff and like probably because they&amp;#39;re healthier people than us what abely not you know what I mean like if I don&amp;#39;t feel like I&amp;#39;ve learned something about you and you&amp;#39;ve made me laugh at something that you shouldn&amp;#39;t laugh at I don&amp;#39;t really [ __ ] with your comedy too much yeah I think it connects the community too cuz it&amp;#39;s such a solo path yeah at the end of the day but what makes it a community where you feel like these are my people is that you can all be like yeah I&amp;#39;m [ __ ] hurting and it&amp;#39;s like oh me too dog I&amp;#39;m going to go up there and hopefully not bomb you know well I was cracking up literally last night um some of the comics were like how you been and I was like I&amp;#39;m a little depressy spaghetti and they&amp;#39;re like me too he&amp;#39;s like you know what I mean like everyone is hurting and we&amp;#39;re all like pretty vulnerable about that fact like there&amp;#39;s not any shaming on you know being sad or like there&amp;#39;s almost more shaming on being happy in the comedy community like you know if you&amp;#39;re like healthy and happy well it seems like it&amp;#39;s part of the craft is knowing how you&amp;#39;re pain can be like intertwined with humor yeah like it&amp;#39;s part of a a skill set yeah and being a comic almost is what I&amp;#39;m getting from just getting to be a part of these conversations recently that makes me feel like a superhero you are superhero we&amp;#39;re basically superhero doctors or something were basically doctor kind of if you like don&amp;#39;t think about it to hard totally makes sense just disregard earlier when she said kill yourself or go to Tik Tok for therapy prescribe you uh I&amp;#39;m not going to men that that um so what your good news yes I want you to share your great awesome amazing [ __ ] chastic news and then also something that you do for yourself that is just like that makes you happy like your your me thing but in what order whichever you choose how about the thing you do that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s happy because I feel like you will forget that M so go do that one first oh my God this is embarrassing I feel like I should have something um I like to smoke weed before bed every night I get high with me and my dog and my bed you get your dog high oh yeah D peta&amp;#39;s going to be pissed no Pet&amp;#39;s not listening to this real good don&amp;#39;t come for me [Music] Peter um no I don&amp;#39;t know oh my God I I think that&amp;#39;s a great answer yeah yeah if that makes you happy that&amp;#39;s like my favorite thing I get excited about it every night that&amp;#39;s perfect yeah okay good news okay um this is even more of an update than you actually have so about two and a half two years ago I was in a trial they were trying to find treatment for Frederick&amp;#39;s AIA I&amp;#39;m going to call it fa from here on out okay um for fa and basically you got to know like the only difference between like me and you like what you can walk and I can&amp;#39;t you produce a protein called fraxin MH I don&amp;#39;t make enough of it so I make about 10% okay and my mom is a carrier she makes 40% but she was like a D1 athlete like you don&amp;#39;t need all of it right okay sorry for the science so the trial they&amp;#39;re injecting for taxin into me and trying to get my body to figure out how to keep producing it mhm um they released like 4 days ago um uh new findings that basically throughout the phases they&amp;#39;ve done and clinical trials are generally four phases and they&amp;#39;re entering phase two I think that it&amp;#39;s working it&amp;#39;s like more than doubling the percentage of protects that I have wow are you in that trial right now no but I I think I think I&amp;#39;m in the next phase in January wow so I&amp;#39;ll be in New York for a month that&amp;#39;s so exciting wait so you&amp;#39;ve already had an injection right yeah I had one cuz they were like scared cuz a monkey died or something um I&amp;#39;m like okay boohoo again Peta we&amp;#39;re so sorry oh my God I always feel bad at laughing at some of the things we&amp;#39;re laughing at but it&amp;#39;s funny you&amp;#39;re y&amp;#39; are good at your craft oh my god well that&amp;#39;s freaking exciting [ __ ] congratulations even there that&amp;#39;s yeah I uh yeah which just this circles back to the first thing we talked about accepting new reality that&amp;#39;s what came up like there&amp;#39;s going to be another shift for you like I&amp;#39;m going have to [ __ ] write new jokes I my comedy career is over no well I feel like there&amp;#39;s managed expectations as you go into it yes consiously optimistic absolutely yeah and then if it does work it&amp;#39;s another shift where you&amp;#39;re like it&amp;#39;ll just I think it expand things for you honestly yeah I&amp;#39;m really stoked cuz like before I was you know no I had to accept the future of like eventually not talking or seeing or hearing I&amp;#39;m Helen Keller by the way but like I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t fear for that I&amp;#39;m hopeful I have faith in science yeah um but yeah well and this might this will be another topic or something for you to think about or I don&amp;#39;t know but you&amp;#39;ll have to build a your identity get so intertwined with um a disability and or or being in a wheelchair just you know you I think if if things start going a different direction that&amp;#39;ll be another big piece of like identity and your comedy I think certainly would change as you change as a person because it seems like it got developed in the midst of all of this and so just let it take it with you and let it you know yeah no that&amp;#39;s going to be weird I don&amp;#39;t know maybe just keep the wheelchair just in case yeah let&amp;#39;s just like bring it on stage and s in it if you start to like go downhill just be like just kidding like oh wait it&amp;#39;s back you [ __ ] ner tell people&amp;#39;s [Music] contagious don&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t give you a hand job oh darn it I really wish I could God that be so awesome if only um

intelligent intelligence Bots is going to explain how it makes life easier for guys with edim so over to you again thank you for having me Andrew so basically everything comes down to language and how we use it how we have been using it for a very long time so how it works is it works with a Transformer model the Transformer model takes in the language in the form of numerical numerically indexed data so you would have a key which would be the word the for example and that would be IND that would have a value so then you would store those dictionaries in memory and then you will access them through a prompt for example this is where we as user come in so that&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s going to work in the background but in the foreground what we do as users is we use input prompts so the large language model takes the input prompt then it processes it through a process called attention so this attention mechanism concentrates on the word and the most likely sequence that will follow that word for example semantically speaking we are he is stuff like that for example so with that neural network in the background working with all of that data we as a user give a input prompt maybe asking something such as please fix this sentence for me so how you would do that for example like with Andrew is you would give the machine context you will explain to the machine listen I have this is a fort experiment but let&amp;#39;s go so I have Frederick toxia and it influences my speech in this way and this way and this way so from that point onward you can tell the large language model chap GPT Gemini uh and there are many more you&amp;#39;re still sitting there with your original input data being what you want to say then it can improve it and be more expressive and that enables you to get your point across at the end of the day it fixes the the issues in the grammar and structure through its neural network and Transformer so that&amp;#39;s how you as a user are enabled at the end of the day to communicate through input prompts with the large language model okay so on and Aon m is R hijack so what what you are saying is some of the words that doesn&amp;#39;t understand it will it it will sorry I&amp;#39;m having issues with the cat um problems so what you&amp;#39;re saying is if doesn&amp;#39;t understand what I&amp;#39;m saying um it can it will try and figure out what would I wanted to to say judging by my previous input into the large language model Yeah so basically your prompt is everything is broken up into token right so every word has a token so this tokenization process allows the large language model to easily decide which word is more relevant to what you were trying to say so it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not a perfect system and you have to build context but it is able to understand and convey your point in writing at the end of the day which in a digital world we all write we all communicate that way so it&amp;#39;s an easier way for you to convey it at the end of the day what you want to say your message your voice this is excellent for for us guys even even without a spe impediment just to to to get across what what you&amp;#39;re wanting to say I I&amp;#39;ve used I&amp;#39;ve used G and J gbd for a lot of stuff for for my website but putting in information and it just it just stretches it so it&amp;#39;s in indispensable tool for every for everybody and now with me giving these tablets to these guys and they will be able to use for voice typing as as well as just general looking up information what what&amp;#39;s cool what&amp;#39;s cool about Gemini is it it&amp;#39;s linked to Google so it can pick up um current information so it it looks through Google so so I think for basic things like i i as my friend in the middle of the night say hey Google what is the time and it looks on the internet and it tells you the time um but then you can do so much more with that you can get information and current information which is indispensable for all of us yeah knowledge is power absolutely so most of the groundwork for this kind of Technology was done in the 1980s around there so if you&amp;#39;re looking at a word processor such as word for example I know a lot of us use Microsoft Word or a similar type of word editor so these have dictionaries right so it&amp;#39;s the people back then relay the groundwork for the stuff we&amp;#39;re doing today and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s amazing it&amp;#39;s really amazing that something from the 80s can be used to this extent it&amp;#39;s those were the building blocks of everything the first Stones basically and it&amp;#39;s amazing it&amp;#39;s really amazing because now the large language model uses those dictionaries at the end of the day it&amp;#39;s not per se a physical dictionary that you have to open you call it a dat structure so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a key value pair it holds a key and it has a value and they correspond with each other so what happens then is those dictionaries are tokenized and those tokens at the end of the day rely on the structure of those words so it&amp;#39;s amazing it&amp;#39;s really amazing it can understand you and it can get creative sometimes it can it really can it&amp;#39;s amazing yeah it&amp;#39;s really cool um for for things that I&amp;#39;ve that I&amp;#39;ve written and you in Microsoft Word you you just speak it and Microsoft pick the voice to the voice to text it picks it up and then you put it through that and with inputs and and it just um creates it in and you can have you can ask it to put it in different styles or different different ways of talking and it and it reworks reworks the information it&amp;#39;s really really quite quite incredible yeah it it is it&amp;#39;s really amazing and what&amp;#39;s even more amazing for me personally is that I understand the underlying bulk of stuff that goes into the tokenization process like the dictionaries in order to build the logic to build the data set but at it&amp;#39;s everything is numerical at the end of the day it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not per se processing the word as much it as it&amp;#39;s processing the numerical tokens at the end of the day which is amazing it&amp;#39;s really amazing it really brings you back to computer language like binary ones and zeros numbers full circle yeah you you&amp;#39;re a bit over my head there with with your technical Jog and and stuff but your spor on and you know way too much [Laughter] good thank you Andrew I appreciate it thank you yeah so anyway guys I I just wanted to show you show you what I&amp;#39;m what I just wanted to show you how how this stuff how Gemini and J GB is enriched my life and will enrich other people&amp;#39;s lives and how what what we are doing with giving these tablets to to these guys they can also use this for for their own studies or or whatever they doing in line and I just want to thank AUD for absolutely everything he does it helps me with everything Teck wise and filming and and so much stuff and I want to thank them for all that and I&amp;#39;ll SP you guys soon and see you next Sunday yeah cheers guys cheers he I for good [Music]",
