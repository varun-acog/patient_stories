Become a member on our website for more Premium Resources: https://ninjanerd.org/lecture/diabetes-mellitus\n\nNinja Nerds!\nIn this lecture, Professor Zach Murphy will present on Diabetes Mellitus. We will discuss the pathophysiology, differentiating between Type 1 diabetes, characterized by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, and Type 2 diabetes, resulting from insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. The lecture will include a discussion on the clinical manifestations, such as polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss. The digital presentation will begin with the diagnostic approach, highlighting the importance of fasting plasma glucose levels, the oral glucose tolerance test, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements. Finally, we will review management strategies for Diabetes Mellitus, emphasizing the role of dietary management, physical activity, blood glucose monitoring, insulin therapy for Type 1 diabetes, and oral hypoglycemic agents for Type 2 diabetes.

    "description": "Access to affordable healthcare for folks with diabetes has been a pressing issue in many communities. But how exactly does diabetes affect the body? Today's Clinical Cut is all about diabetes mellitus.\n\nIn diabetes mellitus, your body has trouble moving glucose, which is a type of sugar, from your blood into your cells.\n\nThis leads to high levels of glucose in your blood and not enough of it in your cells, and remember that your cells need glucose as a source of energy, so not letting the glucose enter means that the cells starve for energy despite having glucose right on their doorstep.\n\nIn general, the body controls how much glucose is in the blood relative to how much gets into the cells with two hormones: insulin and glucagon.\n\nInsulin is used to reduce blood glucose levels, and glucagon is used to increase blood glucose levels. Both of these hormones are produced by clusters of cells in the pancreas called islets of Langerhans. Insulin is secreted by beta cells in the center of the islets, and glucagon is secreted by alpha cells in the periphery of the islets.\n\nThere are two types of diabetes - Type 1 and Type 2, and the main difference between them is the underlying mechanism that causes the blood glucose levels to rise.\n\nDiabetes mellitus is diagnosed when the blood glucose levels get too high, and this is seen among 10% of the world population. About 10% of people with diabetes have Type 1, and the remaining 90% of people with diabetes have Type 2.\n\nCheck out the full video and explanation to learn more about diabetes mellitus on Osmosis: https://osms.it/cc-diabetes-yts\n\n#learnbyosmosis #clinicalcuts #diabetes #diabetesmellitus #type1diabetes #type2diabetes #glucagon #insulin #pathology #physiology #medicine #medstudent #medicalschool #shorts Find our full video library only on Osmosis: http://osms.it/more. \n\nJoin millions of current and future clinicians who learn by Osmosis, along with hundreds of universities around the world who partner with Osmosis from Elseiver to make medical and health education more engaging and efficient.

    "title": "Diabetes Care and Older Adults",
    "description": "Dr. Carol M. Mangione uncovers the biggest challenges health care professionals face when caring for older adults with diabetes. This video is a part of the “Diabetes Care: Finding Common Ground with Guiding Principles” series. To learn more, visit and subscribe to the NIDDK Diabetes Discoveries & Practice Blog.\n\n---\n\nTranscript:\n\nGeriatricians face a lot of challenges when providing diabetes care, and the challenges really stem from the fact that most older adults don't just have diabetes. They're likely to have hypertension, many of them may have chronic renal disease, but they also may have things that aren't directly related to their diabetes, such as osteoarthritis, chronic pain from other problems. \n\nI think the biggest challenges are really about setting priorities and making sure that you keep things as simple as you can, but at the same time, making sure that you're offering the therapies that reduce morbidity and lengthen life and improve quality of life for patients. \n\nAnother big challenge with caring for older adults with diabetes is that it is a very heterogeneous population. Now when you think about it, if somebody is 68 or 69, they could be a person who's had type 2 diabetes for 30 years, and it could be well controlled. But you can also have somebody at the same age who may have already had a stroke, who may have found out a year ago that they have type 2 diabetes. So, we can't just go with age. We have to really think about life expectancy. We have to think about what are the other chronic conditions that the person has under treatment. We also have to think about their functional status, and we have to think a lot about their cognitive status and family support. \n\nWe know that older adults with type 2 diabetes are much more likely to get a group of conditions that we call the geriatric syndromes than people who are of a similar age and don't have diabetes.  \n\nThese geriatric syndromes include gait problems and falls, cognitive impairment, higher rates of depression, higher rates of chronic pain, urinary continence, and challenges with what we call polypharmacy.  \n\nMedicare beneficiaries, oftentimes people over 65, will be on six or more prescription drugs. And when you think about how hard it is to just take one antibiotic correctly when you get sick, you can imagine what it must be like to try to take all of these pills correctly every day.  \n\nThe probability of drug-drug interactions, creating yet a third symptom, happens quite frequently. And as medical regimens get more complex and more medications are added, adherence goes down. \n\nSo, in addition to taking care of the diabetes, these conditions really need to be screened for because many of them are treatable.  \n\nAnd I have to mention that particularly depression travels a lot with diabetes, and we have a growing evidence base that, if you don't treat the depression, it's very hard, not only for older adults but for all adults, to take care of their diabetes. \n\nYou really have to take a very holistic approach to the person you're treating and, as much as possible, you need to engage them in shared decision-making. So, with patients with type 2 diabetes who are older, the frail ones and the people with impaired cognition, there are a lot of family meetings in these decision-making sessions. And we really, as a group, have to decide what's going to be the most feasible and practical care plan to keep someone's quality of life as high as possible, for as long as possible, and to keep the burden of our treatments as low as possible. \n\nThe Guiding Principles have a lot of very useful information for taking care of older adults. And the document that came out of this process has 10 guiding principles.  \n\nThey're very practical. And for all of us who care for older adults with type 2 diabetes, it provides a very efficient place to find that information. So, I would encourage you to look at it and incorporate some of the suggestions into your practice. I think you'll find it helpful.",

But is also linked with diabetes and some metabolic disorders - like Polycystic ovary syndrome and Cushing’s syndrome.\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acanthosis-nigricans/\n\n3) Granuloma Annulare\nIt is thought that the process behind why it appears is most likely due to inflammation. It can be linked with a few conditions, including - diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis, hyperlipidemia and very rarely, some forms of cancer. \nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/granuloma-annulare/\n\n4) Xanthelasma\nThis happens when your body collects extra cholesterol around your eyes. \n\nhttps://www.myheart.org.sg/heart-news/xanthelasma-a-sign-of-high-blood-cholesterol/\nhttps://clinicafai.com/understanding-xanthelasma-the-weird-yellow-deposits-on-your-eyelids/\n\n5) Eruptive Xanthomatosis)\nIf you develop a break out of small reddish-yellow bumps across your body - this CAN BE a sign of underlying metabolic disease. The skin eruptions are usually non-tender but in some cases cause may be itchy, but the good news is they’re not contagious.\n\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/eruptive-xanthomatosis#outlook\n\n6) Diabetic cheiroarthropathy\nIts characterized by waxy skin-thickening over the palm of the hand which restricts mobility, particularly affecting the extension of the MCPs and PIP joints\n\n7) Foot Ulcers\nDiabetics can have poor circulation and high sugar levels, which can slow down the healing process and make you more prone to infections. Getting wounds infected can prolong the amount of time it takes to heal. \n\n8) Skin tags\nSome people can get these as a result of diabetes. The reason isn’t fully understood but its likely a number of factors including insulin resistance, obesity, and hormonal changes\nhttps://www.healthdirect.gov.au/skin-tags\n\n9) Diabetic Dermopathy\nDiabetic dermopathy is it's thought to be related to damage to the small blood vessels that supply the skin. Poor blood circulation and changes in the structure of the skin may contribute to the development of these patches.\n\nhttps://diabetes.co.in/what-is-diabetes-dermopathy/\n\n10) Dry itchy skin\nBut itchy skin can result from dry skin or poor circulation, both of which are more likely when you have diabetes. \n\n11) Fungal infection\nWhen we are diabetic and have high sugar levels - this can encourage the growth of fungal infections. \n\n12)Bacteria infection\nSimilar to fungal infections - bacterial infections are also more common in diabetics. Other skin infections like impetigo and folloculitis are also more common.\n\n13) Blisters\nThey can develop if there has been some friction to the skin and due to neuropathy you may not have felt the discomfort \n\n#diabetessymptoms #diabetes #prediabetes \n\nDISCLAIMER: ** The information in this video is intended to serve as educational information and is not intended or implied to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

    "description": "Get access to my FREE resources 👉 https://drbrg.co/45aulSQ\n\nHere’s how to stop prediabetes going into diabetes. This is important. \n\nNEW KETO RECIPES CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnAGH-jp4YXl30rir1BPrxA/\n\nFor more details on this topic, check out the full article on the website:\n➡️ https://drbrg.co/480ddj6\n\nHealthy Ketogenic Diet and Intermittent Fasting:\n▶️ https://youtu.be/vMZfyEy_jpI\n▶️ https://youtu.be/mBqpaAKtnXE\n▶️ https://youtu.be/3dHcT1-K-tw \n\nTimestamps\n0:00 Stop prediabetes going into diabetes \n0:25 The difference between prediabetes and diabetes\n1:30 A closer look at blood sugar and insulin \n3:15 Insulin resistance \n5:00 What you could do \n5:25 The test you need that’s never done \n6:13 Symptoms of insulin resistance \n8:19 Other problems with sugar \n\nToday we’re going to talk about how to help stop a person from going from a prediabetic state to a diabetic state. This is a very important concept. \n\nThe difference between prediabetes and diabetes has to do with your blood sugars. \n\n • With prediabetes, your blood sugars are around 100-125, with an A1C of 5.7-6.4%. \n • With diabetes, your blood sugars are 126 and greater, with an A1C of 6.5% or greater. \n\nWhen we’re talking about diabetes type 2, we’re talking about the elevation of sugar in your blood. A normal blood sugar level should be about 80. This is equal to about 1 tsp of sugar in all of your blood. Your body can make this sugar itself. You don’t need to consume any sugar. The average person consumes about 31 tsp of sugar every day (including carbs).\n\nInsulin acts as a filter that keeps excess sugar out of the blood. The body does not want high amounts of sugar in the blood. Your body considers excess sugar to be very dangerous. \n\nIf a person is consuming a lot of carbohydrates and eats frequently, they could have a huge amount of insulin being released. This insulin is working very hard to keep the sugar down. But, high levels of insulin are toxic to the body as well. So, your body starts to reduce insulin by creating resistance. This is called insulin resistance. \n\nThe problem is that the body still has to keep the blood sugar under control, so it begins to produce more and more insulin to try to keep the sugar at a normal level. This could go on for a long time until, eventually, the pancreas is exhausted and can’t pump out that much insulin. \n\nAt this point, if you keep consuming carbohydrates and eating frequently, the blood sugar is going to go up. This happens because the insulin is going down. Over time this could turn into diabetes. \n\nTo help avoid all of this, you can cut out the carbs and start doing intermittent fasting. \n\nDoctors are focused on blood sugars. They typically do not measure if you have insulin resistance. 90% of people that are prediabetic don’t even know. \n\nIf you look down and you can’t see your feet, you may have insulin resistance. \n\nSymptoms of insulin resistance:\n • Frequent urination (even at night) \n • Brain fog\n • Can't go long without being hungry \n • Cravings \n • Tired after meals \n • Tingling feet \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 58, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

    "description": "12 Unusual Symptoms of Diabetes | Diabetes Symptoms | Diabetes Mellitus |  | Diabetes Warning Signs\n\nIn this video we have discussed some early and unusual signs and symptoms of diabetes.\nThere are mainly 3 types of diabetes:\nType – I: where insulin is completely absent\nType – II: where either insulin formation decreases, or the body is not responding to the insulin formed.\nGestational diabetes - Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes\n\nHow can you tell if you have diabetes? \nMost early symptoms are from higher-than-normal levels of glucose.\n\nWhat are the early signs of Diabetes?\n\nHunger and Fatigue\nThe food we eat is converted into glucose, which our cells use for energy. Our cells need insulin to take in glucose. But in diabetes there isn’t enough or any insulin. So the glucose can't get into them and you have no energy. This can make you hungrier and more tired than usual.\n\nPeeing more often and being thirstier\nA person with diabetes may need to pee a lot more, than an average person.\n\nDry mouth & Itchy Skin\nBecause the body is using a lot of fluid to make urine, there's less moisture available for other things. This can make you dehydrated, and your Mouth may feel dry. \n\nBlurred vision\nChanging fluid levels in body can make the lens in Eyes swell up. \n\nWhat are the symptoms of Diabetes\nThese appear after the glucose level is high for a long time.\n\nFungal or yeast infections:\nExcess glucose in your body promotes fungal infection. In diabetes there can be fungal infections\nBetween fingers and toes\nUnder breasts\nIn or around genital organs.\n\nSlow-healing sores or cuts\nOver time, high blood sugar can affect the blood flow and it may even cause nerve damage. \nThat makes it hard for your body to heal wounds.\n\nPain or numbness in feet or legs\nThis is also a result of nerve damage caused by high blood glucose.\n\nUnplanned weight loss\nIf your body can't get energy from the food you consume, then it will start burning muscle and fat for energy.  This leads to the unintentional weight loss.\n\nNausea & Vomiting\nWhen the body burns fat, it makes ketones. These ketones can build up in blood to dangerous levels. These Ketones can make you feel sick.\n\nWhat are the warning Signs of Diabetes Complications\nSigns of diabetes' complications may include:\nSlow-healing sores or cuts\nItchy skin (usually around the vaginal or groin area)\nFrequent yeast infections.\nRecent weight gain.\nVelvety, dark skin changes of the neck, armpit, and groin, called Acanthosis nigricans\nNumbness and tingling of the hands and feet\nDecreased vision\nImpotence or erectile dysfunction (ED)\n\nA serious complication of prolonged increase in blood glucose is Diabetic Coma\nThis serious complication can even lead to death. \nIt may occur with either type of diabetes, though it’s more common in type 2. \n\nOther complications of diabetes are:\nHeart disease and stroke\nDiabetic retinopathy\nGlaucoma\nCataract\nChronic kidney disease (CKD)\nNeuropathy\nGum diseases\n\nWhen to visit a Doctor\nIf you're older than 45 or have other risks for diabetes, it's important to get tested. \nWhen you diagnose the condition early, you can avoid nerve damage, Heart trouble, and other complications.\n\n#diabetes\n#diabetessymptoms\n#diabetesmellitus\n#type2diabetes\n\nMedical disclaimer: Medinaz Academy does not provide medical advice.

Recognizing the early signs of diabetes is crucial for seeking timely treatment. Here are the top 5 early signs that you might have diabetes:\n\n1. Increased Thirst and Urination\n\nOne of the most common early signs of diabetes is increased thirst and frequent urination. High blood sugar levels cause your kidneys to work overtime to filter and absorb the excess sugar. This leads to more frequent urination, which can dehydrate your body and make you feel constantly thirsty.\n\n2. Unexplained Weight Loss\n\nIf you’re losing weight without making any changes to your diet or exercise routine, it could be a sign of diabetes. When your body doesn’t get enough energy from glucose, it starts to burn fat and muscle for fuel, leading to unexpected weight loss.\n\n3. Fatigue\n\nFeeling unusually tired or fatigued all the time? High blood sugar levels can affect your body’s ability to use glucose for energy, leaving you feeling sluggish and fatigued. This constant tiredness can be a key indicator of diabetes.\n\n4. Blurred Vision\n\nHigh blood sugar can cause the lenses in your eyes to swell, leading to blurred vision. If you’re experiencing difficulty seeing clearly, it’s important to get your blood sugar levels checked as this can be an early sign of diabetes.\n\n5. Slow-Healing Wounds\n\nCuts, bruises, and infections that take longer to heal can be a sign of high blood sugar. Diabetes can impair your body’s ability to heal wounds properly, making you more susceptible to infections and slow recovery times.\n\nConclusion\nIf you notice any of these early signs, it’s important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis. Early detection and management of diabetes can significantly improve your quality of life and prevent serious complications.\n\n#shorts #shortsfeed #diet #diabetes #diabetesawareness #healthtips #health #nutrition #trending #trendingshorts #bloodsugar #DiabetesPrevention\n\n\nMedical disclaimer: Medinaz Academy does not provide medical advice.

However, in 1990, it was discovered that diabetes is not caused by insulin resistance but rather by too much insulin. Therefore, whenever you analyze, you will find that 80% of diabetics do not have a lack of insulin in their bodies; instead, they have excess insulin, and their bodies are insulin resistant. This can be managed with our diet because if we eat food with low glycemic load, diabetes will gradually start to reverse.\n\nDiabexy's mission is to eradicate diabetes from India like polio and it is possible with the help of knowledge and discipline that's why Diabexy makes educational videos, Diabexy makes food products that have very low glycemic load and also provides free consultations with medical doctors and dietitians.

    "description": "Keeping diabetes under control is critical to living a long and healthy life and this is where diet comes in 🥗\nThe right diet plays an extremely important role in keeping blood sugar levels under control and ensuring that diabetics can lead a normal life ✅\n\nOpt for foods that are low in fat and calories and high in fibre and proteins. The fibre slows the release of glucose into the bloodstream, preventing blood sugar spikes that worsen blood sugar control and make you feel hungry 😉\n\nDiabetics must include a lot of low glycemic index foods – those that lead to a steady rise in the level of glucose in the blood and a gentle rise in insulin – in their diet 💯\n\nHere are 6 foods that are excellent for diabetes:\n#1 Fenugreek Seeds\n#2 Insulin Leaves\n#3 Cinnamon\n#4 Apple Cider Vinegar\n#5 Flax Seeds\n#6 Chia Seeds\n\nWhich among these will you be using?

    "title": "Type 1 Diabetes",
    "description": "MEDICAL ANIMATION TRANSCRIPT:  One of the endocrine functions of the pancreas is to secrete a hormone called insulin into the blood. Microscopic regions of beta cells in the pancreas are located on the islets of Langerhans. These beta cells release insulin. After consumption of a meal, increasing amounts of glucose in the blood trigger beta cells in the islets to secrete the appropriate amount of insulin hormone, which travels through the bloodstream to target cells, where it promotes the transport of glucose into the cells. Glucose must get inside cells to participate in cellular respiration, which creates the energy needed for cellular processes. Certain tissues, such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, require insulin to unlock their cells before glucose can enter. Insulin attaches to specific receptors on the cell's surface, causing glucose transporter proteins in the cell membrane to open, allowing glucose to pass into the cell. As cells take up glucose, the blood glucose level falls. Type 1 diabetes is a disease in which the pancreas loses its ability to produce insulin, resulting in high blood glucose levels and other metabolic complications. In this disease, antibodies secreted by lymphocytes attack and destroy the beta cells, so the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Lack of sufficient insulin prevents glucose from entering cells, resulting in a high blood glucose concentration, a condition called hyperglycemia. Unable to pass into cells, glucose builds up in the blood. The kidneys filter out the excess glucose, which is lost in urine, resulting in glycosuria, or large quantities of glucose in the urine. Common symptoms of hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetes include polyphagia, or excessive eating; polydipsia, or excessive thirst; polyuria, or increased urine volume; and unexplained weight loss. As the insulin deficiency continues, cells are unable to use sugar for energy, so the body breaks down fats and proteins to use them as an alternative source of energy. As fat breakdown continues, acidic byproducts, known as ketone bodies, accumulate in the blood, resulting in a condition called ketosis. If allowed to build up to dangerously high levels, a life-threatening condition called diabetic ketoacidosis results. Type 1 diabetes can cause degenerative tissue damage, resulting in long-term complications, such as atherosclerosis, blindness, neuropathy, and renal dysfunction. Licensed health professionals prescribe insulin replacement therapy to treat type 1 diabetes. If a diabetic person uses a syringe to deliver doses of insulin, he or she must rotate between injection sites to prevent localized tissue damage and absorption problems. Once delivered via syringe or insulin pump, the insulin rapidly reduces hyperglycemia, facilitating transport of glucose into cells. Insulin also suppresses ketosis, restoring metabolic balance. In addition to insulin therapy, patients must manage their glucose levels closely with frequent glucose checks, which should fall between 70 and 120 milligrams per deciliter. Patients should also monitor their blood glucose level with periodic hemoglobin A1C tests, which measure the amount of glycated hemoglobin in the blood over a two to three-month period. Glycated hemoglobin is created when glucose attaches to hemoglobin within red blood cells. Glycated hemoglobin forms at a rate that increases with plasma glucose levels. The desired hemoglobin A1C level for people with diabetes is less than 7%. The higher the hemoglobin A1C level, the higher the risk of developing complications from diabetes. Other actions patients can take to monitor their glucose levels more closely are diet control and consistent exercise. By treating and controlling blood glucose levels, patients may prevent the occurrence of the complications of diabetes.\n\nVisit our website to learn more about using Nucleus content for patient engagement and content marketing: http://www.nucleushealth.com/",

    "description": "5 Hidden Skin Signs of Diabetes | Diabetes skin signs | Diabetes symptoms\n\n5 Skin Signs of Diabetes You Shouldn't Ignore\nDiabetes can affect your body in many ways, including your skin. Recognizing these signs early can help in the effective management of diabetes. Here are five skin symptoms that could indicate diabetes:\n\n1. Dark Patches\n\nAcanthosis nigricans causes dark, velvety skin patches, often found on the neck, armpits, and groin. This condition is usually a sign of insulin resistance, which is commonly associated with type 2 diabetes. If you notice these patches, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider.\n\n2. Itchy Skin\n\nPersistent itchiness, especially in the lower legs, can be due to poor circulation or dry skin, both of which are common in people with diabetes. Proper skin care and glucose control can help alleviate this symptom.\n\n3. Yellow Bumps\n\nEruptive xanthomatosis causes yellow, pea-like bumps on the skin, typically appearing on the buttocks, thighs, and arms. These bumps are often surrounded by red halos and can be a sign of uncontrolled diabetes or high triglyceride levels.\n\n4. Thickened Skin\n\nDiabetic dermopathy appears as light brown, scaly patches on the front of the legs, resembling age spots. These patches are harmless but are indicative of diabetes and should prompt a consultation with a healthcare professional.\n\n5. Blisters\n\nDiabetic blisters, also known as bullosis diabeticorum, can appear on the hands, feet, legs, or forearms. These blisters are painless and resemble burn blisters. While they usually heal on their own, they are a sign that your diabetes needs better management.\n\nEarly Detection Can Help\nIf you notice any of these skin changes, it’s important to seek medical advice. Early detection and proper management of diabetes can prevent further complications and improve your quality of life.\n\nMedical disclaimer: Medinaz Academy does not provide medical advice.

    "description": "Book a FREE diet consultation with our Certified Diabetes Reversal Coach visit\nhttps://appointment.diabexy.com/#/customer/free-diabetes-consultation\n\nHow To Reverse Diabetes At Home\n\nThe biggest rule of Diabetes Reversal is that we have to keep the Glycemic Load below 25 throughout the day. Let us see how we arrive at this figure of 25. 1 Glycemic Load is equal to 20 units of blood sugar, then 25 units of Glycemic Load will give equal to 500 units of blood sugar. 1 unit of insulin covers 50 units of blood sugar. So if our pancreas is working even a little, it will produce 10 units of insulin in a whole day. This means that if we keep our Glycemic Load below 25 for the whole day, then our body will manage the blood sugar for the whole day on its own because it is producing this much insulin on its own.\n\nBut in many cases, medical advice will also be required and in many places, dose adjustments will also be required, for that call the number given by Diabexy 8448952009 or book your Free Diabetes Diet Consultation by clicking on the link given above.\n\nFor more information\nVisit us at https://diabexy.com/\nEmail us at info@diabexy.com\nCall or WhatsApp us at 8448952009\n\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/diabexy\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/diabexy",

    "description": "Diabetes Symptoms | Diabetes Mellitus | Type 2 Diabetes - Signs & Symptoms | Diabetes Warning Signs\n\nIn this video we have discussed types of diabetes and early signs and symptoms of diabetes.\nThere are mainly 3 types of diabetes:\nType – I: where insulin is completely absent\nType – II: where either insulin formation decreases, or the body is not responding to the insulin formed.\nGestational diabetes - Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes\n\nHow can you tell if you have diabetes? \nMost early symptoms are from higher-than-normal levels of glucose.\n\nWhat are the early signs of Diabetes?\n\nHunger and Fatigue\nThe food we eat is converted into glucose, which our cells use for energy. Our cells need insulin to take in glucose. But in diabetes there isn’t enough or any insulin. So the glucose can't get into them and you have no energy. This can make you hungrier and more tired than usual.\n\nPeeing more often and being thirstier\nA person with diabetes may need to pee a lot more, than an average person.\n\nDry mouth & Itchy Skin\nBecause the body is using a lot of fluid to make urine, there's less moisture available for other things. This can make you dehydrated, and your Mouth may feel dry. \n\nBlurred vision\nChanging fluid levels in body can make the lens in Eyes swell up. \n\nWhat are the symptoms of Diabetes\nThese appear after the glucose level is high for a long time.\n\nFungal or yeast infections:\nExcess glucose in your body promotes fungal infection. In diabetes there can be fungal infections\nBetween fingers and toes\nUnder breasts\nIn or around genital organs.\n\nSlow-healing sores or cuts\nOver time, high blood sugar can affect the blood flow and it may even cause nerve damage. \nThat makes it hard for your body to heal wounds.\n\nPain or numbness in feet or legs\nThis is also a result of nerve damage caused by high blood glucose.\n\nUnplanned weight loss\nIf your body can't get energy from the food you consume, then it will start burning muscle and fat for energy.  This leads to the unintentional weight loss.\n\nNausea & Vomiting\nWhen the body burns fat, it makes ketones. These ketones can build up in blood to dangerous levels. These Ketones can make you feel sick.\n\nWhat are the warning Signs of Diabetes Complications\nSigns of diabetes' complications may include:\nSlow-healing sores or cuts\nItchy skin (usually around the vaginal or groin area)\nFrequent yeast infections.\nRecent weight gain.\nVelvety, dark skin changes of the neck, armpit, and groin, called Acanthosis nigricans\nNumbness and tingling of the hands and feet\nDecreased vision\nImpotence or erectile dysfunction (ED)\n\nA serious complication of prolonged increase in blood glucose is Diabetic Coma\nThis serious complication can even lead to death. \nIt may occur with either type of diabetes, though it’s more common in type 2. \n\nOther complications of diabetes are:\nHeart disease and stroke\nDiabetic retinopathy\nGlaucoma\nCataract\nChronic kidney disease (CKD)\nNeuropathy\nGum diseases\n\nWhen to visit a Doctor\nIf you're older than 45 or have other risks for diabetes, it's important to get tested. \nWhen you diagnose the condition early, you can avoid nerve damage, Heart trouble, and other complications.\n\n#diabetes\n#diabetessymptoms\n#diabetesmellitus\n#type2diabetes\n\nMedical disclaimer: Medinaz Academy does not provide medical advice.

Literally, since the neanderthals were walking around, painting in caves. \n\nRecently, I went to the doctor. And something happened. I had to pee in a cup, you know, pretty routine. But my doctor came back with this look on his face and he was like… your pee is full of sugar. Turns out, this could be a sign of diabetes. \n\nSo while I was waiting for my test results… you know me. I was doom scrolling. Googling until 3am. Just preparing myself for the worst. I ended up not having diabetes, but even still… I couldn’t stop reading about it. Because this disease has an *insane* history. \n\nBefore there was insulin and Ozempic, there were starvation diets, opium cocktails, and… beer made of literal pee. Let’s get into it.\n\nI appreciate you for coming by, and tune in next week for more Dark History.\n\nWant some cool Bailey Merch?\nShop Dark History Merch: https://www.baileysarian.com\n\nI sometimes talk about my Good Reads in the show.

So the answer is, Corn Flakes are actually one of the worst choices for diabetics because their glucose load is extremely high, often in the 75 to 80. When we eat such foods, they cause a spike in glucose levels. So, rather than focusing on taste, we need to understand that even foods with a sour taste can cause a significant sugar spike. If we categorize food based on taste alone, it’s not an ideal way of assessing it that's why the selection of food items should be based on EGL not taste. \n\nFor example, sugar substitutes also taste sweet, but they don’t cause a spike. It’s essential to understand this \"glucose load\" parameter rather than relying only on taste as a basis. Using taste as the basis to analyze food is not the correct approach, nor is it scientific. \n\nDiabexy's mission is to eradicate diabetes from India like polio and it is possible with the help of knowledge and discipline that's why Diabexy makes educational videos, Diabexy makes food products that have very low glycemic load and also provides free consultations with medical doctors and dietitians. So if you also believe that diabetes can be eradicated then we can work together to eradicate diabetes from India.\n\nDiabexy products are specially designed for diabetics. They help in managing blood sugar levels while supplementing your daily nutritional requirements.

    "title": "Why Should You Use Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) for Diabetes?",
    "description": "What does apple cider vinegar have to do with diabetes? You’ll be surprised how this simple product can benefit in controlling your blood sugar levels. But it’s not all roses: ACV can also have some side effects that you truly wouldn’t want. So let’s talk about all of this today!\n\n🚨Take a 60-second quiz to evaluate your diabetes health state👉https://bit.ly/3D9D1gm\n________________________________________________\n\nApple cider vinegar is made in a two-step fermentation process. Firstly, apples are crushed and combined with yeast to convert sugar into alcohol. Second, bacteria are added to ferment the alcohol into acetic acid. And specifically acetic acid in ACV may contribute to health benefits. It does that in several ways:\n\n- Lowers blood sugar levels;\n- Decreases insulin levels;\n- Boosts metabolism;\n- Increases fat burning;\n- Reduces appetite.\n\nWhen you have diabetes, you have a lot riding on your blood sugar levels. You know that diabetes management is mainly based on physical activity and a healthy diet, but surprisingly, apple cider vinegar can also be included in reducing blood sugar levels. One study that was published in the Diabetes Care journal looked into how ACV can help manage blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes. It showed that consuming 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar before bedtime reduces fasting blood sugar by 4% the following morning. Another research shows that consuming vinegar after a high-carb meal can improve insulin sensitivity by as much as 19–34% and significantly reduce blood sugar levels.\n\nAnother important benefit of ACV for diabetes is weight loss. Being obese is a risk factor for diabetes. Of course, the best way to lose weight is by exercising and investing in a healthy diet. But there are other means you can consider when looking to lose weight. And some studies link apple cider vinegar with weight loss. One research showed that consuming apple cider vinegar can result in effective weight loss during a 12-week period. In this study, people took 1–2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar diluted in water every day. And they lost an average of 4lbs each, as well as visceral body fat!\n\nHow should you use apple cider vinegar?\nYou can use it with olive oil as a salad dressing. It’s especially tasty with leafy greens, cucumbers, and tomatoes. But the easiest way is to mix it into water. Just add 1–2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar into a glass of water, stir it up and drink it. Remember, you don’t want to take any shots of apple cider vinegar straight from the bottle! Because of vinegar’s acidic compounds, it should always be mixed. Otherwise, you risk side effects like tooth enamel erosion or drug interactions.\n\n🔔SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/c/KlinioApp🔔\n________________________________________________\n\n💥Ultimate Diabetes Nutrition Guide: What, When, and How to Eat👇\nhttps://youtu.be/T2qcJA1iayk\n\n💥Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes: Full Guide to Diabetes Management👇\nhttps://youtu.be/W2wjMqjbuFQ\n\n💥4 Easy Physical Activities to Lose Weight With Diabetes👇\nhttps://youtu.be/V83c72CNmeY\n________________________________________________\n\nKlinio channel creates reliable, fact-based, entertaining videos about diabetes mellitus and diabetes management.

    "description": "Don’t overlook these 15 nighttime signs of diabetes!\n\n0:00 Introduction: Diabetic signs at night \n0:11 Frequent urinating\n1:35 Restless legs syndrome \n2:42 Diabetic neuropathy\n4:01 Excessive sweating \n5:47 Hypoglycemia \n7:11 Gastric reflux \n8:55 Heart palpitations\n9:15 Teeth grinding \n9:28 Headache \n\nCheck out these 15 symptoms of high blood sugar that might occur while you’re sleeping. \n\n1. Frequent urinating \nThis is known as nocturia and occurs when your kidneys remove excess sugar from your blood.\n\n2. Excessive thirst \nAs your kidneys eliminate sugar through your urine, you deplete magnesium, potassium, and calcium. You can also become dehydrated, so you may have excessive thirst. \n\n3. Restless legs syndrome \nExcess sugar depletes vitamin B1. Vitamin B1 deficiency causes lactic acid buildup and a lack of oxygen in the legs. This can also be related to magnesium deficiency. \n\n4. Peripheral neuropathy\nThis condition causes burning, pain, or numbness on the bottom of the feet. Benfotiamine combined with alpha lipoic acid is a great remedy. \n\n5. Cramps in lower legs and feet\nToo much sugar in the blood can cause a magnesium deficiency and calcium buildup. Magnesium glycinate supplements can help, and can also improve sleep.\n\n6. Excessive sweating \nThis usually occurs in the face, neck, or upper part of the body. High blood sugar causes sympathetic dominance, which causes a person to be in a constant state of fight or flight. \n\n7. Sleep apnea \nThis usually occurs because a person has high levels of insulin. \n\n8. Hypoglycemia \nIf you have high blood sugar, your body will try to lower it with insulin. This can cause you to wake up during the night with low blood sugar. Following a low-carb diet for at least 6 to 8 months can help correct this problem. \n\n9. Delayed sleep \nHigh levels of sugar delay the release of melatonin.\n\n10. Gastric reflux \nHigh blood sugar can affect the autonomic nervous system that controls the valve on the top of the stomach, causing GERD.\n\n11. Nightmares/vivid dreams \nThis is typically related to a neurotransmitter problem caused by a deficiency in vitamin B1, which is depleted by high blood sugar.\n\n12. High blood pressure \nNocturnal dipping occurs when your blood pressure and pulse rate decrease during sleep. When you have diabetes, this doesn’t happen. This is called non-dipping.\n\n13. Heart palpitations\nThis is caused by a lack of potassium and magnesium and can be corrected with a good electrolyte powder.\n \n14. Teeth grinding \nThe activation of the sympathetic nervous system puts a person into a state of stress while they’re sleeping, causing teeth grinding. \n\n15. Headache upon waking\nThis usually occurs because of dehydration. \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 59, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

    "description": "#Type2Diabetes  #HBP  #HighCholesterol\n\nMEDICAL ANIMATION TRANSCRIPT: It is common for people with high blood pressure and abnormal lipid levels to also have type 2 diabetes. This video will show how having all of these conditions can affect your health, and what you can do to reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes. If you have high blood pressure, it means the force of the blood pushing on the walls of your blood vessels is too high. Your heart has to work harder when your blood pressure is high. Some people with high blood pressure develop type 2 diabetes. If you have abnormal levels of lipids in your blood, it may mean you have too much LDL cholesterol also known as bad cholesterol, or it may mean that you don't have enough HDL cholesterol also known as good cholesterol, or your triglyceride level also known as the fat in the blood may be too high. You may have more than one of these lipid abnormalities at the same time. People with abnormal lipid levels have a higher rate of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a condition where your blood glucose or blood sugar is elevated. Over time, high blood sugar can damage the blood vessels of your heart and other organs leading to other health problems. Having high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels and type 2 diabetes can affect you in many ways. You will have a higher risk for other serious health problems such as coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke and even death. You may need help taking care of yourself. You may also need to take more medications. Living with these conditions may cause depression. The good news is that there are things you can do to help lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. For example, you may need to make changes to your lifestyle. If you smoke, get the help you need to quit. Maintain or get to a healthy weight. Follow a healthy eating plan including low-fat and low-sodium foods. And work with your healthcare provider to determine the right amount of physical activity for you. Make sure you work with your healthcare provider to control your blood pressure and lipid levels. This includes taking medications as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Following the treatment plan, you and your healthcare provider discussed will help you feel better and reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes.\n\nANH18207",

    "title": "Diabetes Symptoms | Diabetes Mellitus | Type 2 Diabetes - Signs & Symptoms | Diabetes Warning Signs",
    "description": "Diabetes Symptoms | Diabetes Mellitus | Type 2 Diabetes - Signs & Symptoms | Diabetes Warning Signs\n\nIn this video we have discussed types of diabetes and early signs and symptoms of diabetes.\nThere are mainly 3 types of diabetes:\nType – I: where insulin is completely absent\nType – II: where either insulin formation decreases, or the body is not responding to the insulin formed.\nGestational diabetes - Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes\n\nHow can you tell if you have diabetes? \nMost early symptoms are from higher-than-normal levels of glucose.\n\nWhat are the early signs of Diabetes?\n\nHunger and Fatigue\nThe food we eat is converted into glucose, which our cells use for energy. Our cells need insulin to take in glucose. But in diabetes there isn’t enough or any insulin. So the glucose can't get into them and you have no energy. This can make you hungrier and more tired than usual.\n\nPeeing more often and being thirstier\nA person with diabetes may need to pee a lot more, than an average person.\n\nDry mouth & Itchy Skin\nBecause the body is using a lot of fluid to make urine, there's less moisture available for other things. This can make you dehydrated, and your Mouth may feel dry. \n\nBlurred vision\nChanging fluid levels in body can make the lens in Eyes swell up. \n\nWhat are the symptoms of Diabetes\nThese appear after the glucose level is high for a long time.\n\nFungal or yeast infections:\nExcess glucose in your body promotes fungal infection. In diabetes there can be fungal infections\nBetween fingers and toes\nUnder breasts\nIn or around genital organs.\n\nSlow-healing sores or cuts\nOver time, high blood sugar can affect the blood flow and it may even cause nerve damage. \nThat makes it hard for your body to heal wounds.\n\nPain or numbness in feet or legs\nThis is also a result of nerve damage caused by high blood glucose.\n\nUnplanned weight loss\nIf your body can't get energy from the food you consume, then it will start burning muscle and fat for energy.  This leads to the unintentional weight loss.\n\nNausea & Vomiting\nWhen the body burns fat, it makes ketones. These ketones can build up in blood to dangerous levels. These Ketones can make you feel sick.\n\nWhat are the warning Signs of Diabetes Complications\nSigns of diabetes' complications may include:\nSlow-healing sores or cuts\nItchy skin (usually around the vaginal or groin area)\nFrequent yeast infections.\nRecent weight gain.\nVelvety, dark skin changes of the neck, armpit, and groin, called Acanthosis nigricans\nNumbness and tingling of the hands and feet\nDecreased vision\nImpotence or erectile dysfunction (ED)\n\nA serious complication of prolonged increase in blood glucose is Diabetic Coma\nThis serious complication can even lead to death. \nIt may occur with either type of diabetes, though it’s more common in type 2. \n\nOther complications of diabetes are:\nHeart disease and stroke\nDiabetic retinopathy\nGlaucoma\nCataract\nChronic kidney disease (CKD)\nNeuropathy\nGum diseases\n\nWhen to visit a Doctor\nIf you're older than 45 or have other risks for diabetes, it's important to get tested. \nWhen you diagnose the condition early, you can avoid nerve damage, Heart trouble, and other complications.\n\n#diabetes\n#diabetessymptoms\n#diabetesmellitus\n#type2diabetes\n\nMedical disclaimer: Medinaz Academy does not provide medical advice.

After watching the videos, people generally have many quires which they put in the comment box regarding diabetes. This program is designed to answer those quires. Therefore, Diabexy brings you the show \"Diabexy Talk Show on Diabetes\" Here, we will answer your questions precisely, debunk many diabetes-related myths, and raise awareness about the condition. You may please ask your questions by clicking on the above link and submitting your queries.  \n\n🤔 Why does fasting blood sugar decrease slowly? \n\nThe reason fasting blood sugar decreases gradually is that blood sugar levels do not remain constant in the body. Our body follows a circadian rhythm, and this internal clock resets around 4 AM. This reset allows the pancreas to capture the circulating insulin and clear the blood sugar. As the liver pulls in this insulin, the pancreas starts pumping fresh insulin. This process doesn't have a significant impact on blood sugar levels. However, in diabetic patients, the pancreas is weakened. While the liver continues its function of pulling in the excess insulin, the pancreas fails to release fresh insulin. This leads to a decrease in insulin levels in the body, while the level of glucagon, which is insulin's opposite, increases. Glucagon then converts the fat stored in the liver into sugar, releasing new glucose into the bloodstream and causing blood sugar levels to rise.   \n\nDiabexy's mission is to eradicate diabetes from India like polio and it is possible with the help of knowledge and discipline that's why Diabexy makes educational videos, Diabexy makes food products that have very low glycemic load and also provides free consultations with medical doctors and dietitians. So if you also believe that diabetes can be eradicated then we can work together to eradicate diabetes from India.\n\nDiabexy products are specially designed for diabetics. They help in managing blood sugar levels while supplementing your daily nutritional requirements. With over a decade of research and development to develop low glycemic load food products, we believe that it is possible to reverse diabetes (डायबिटीज रेवेर्सल) with the help of healthy eating habits and disciplined lifestyle.\n\nAt Diabexy, we believe it is possible to reverse diabetes with the support of knowledge and discipline.

    "description": "Don’t overlook these 15 nighttime signs of diabetes!\n\n0:00 Introduction: Diabetic signs at night \n0:11 Frequent urinating\n1:35 Restless legs syndrome \n2:42 Diabetic neuropathy\n4:01 Excessive sweating \n5:47 Hypoglycemia \n7:11 Gastric reflux \n8:55 Heart palpitations\n9:15 Teeth grinding \n9:28 Headache \n\nCheck out these 15 symptoms of high blood sugar that might occur while you’re sleeping. \n\n1. Frequent urinating \nThis is known as nocturia and occurs when your kidneys remove excess sugar from your blood.\n\n2. Excessive thirst \nAs your kidneys eliminate sugar through your urine, you deplete magnesium, potassium, and calcium. You can also become dehydrated, so you may have excessive thirst. \n\n3. Restless legs syndrome \nExcess sugar depletes vitamin B1. Vitamin B1 deficiency causes lactic acid buildup and a lack of oxygen in the legs. This can also be related to magnesium deficiency. \n\n4. Peripheral neuropathy\nThis condition causes burning, pain, or numbness on the bottom of the feet. Benfotiamine combined with alpha lipoic acid is a great remedy. \n\n5. Cramps in lower legs and feet\nToo much sugar in the blood can cause a magnesium deficiency and calcium buildup. Magnesium glycinate supplements can help, and can also improve sleep.\n\n6. Excessive sweating \nThis usually occurs in the face, neck, or upper part of the body. High blood sugar causes sympathetic dominance, which causes a person to be in a constant state of fight or flight. \n\n7. Sleep apnea \nThis usually occurs because a person has high levels of insulin. \n\n8. Hypoglycemia \nIf you have high blood sugar, your body will try to lower it with insulin. This can cause you to wake up during the night with low blood sugar. Following a low-carb diet for at least 6 to 8 months can help correct this problem. \n\n9. Delayed sleep \nHigh levels of sugar delay the release of melatonin.\n\n10. Gastric reflux \nHigh blood sugar can affect the autonomic nervous system that controls the valve on the top of the stomach, causing GERD.\n\n11. Nightmares/vivid dreams \nThis is typically related to a neurotransmitter problem caused by a deficiency in vitamin B1, which is depleted by high blood sugar.\n\n12. High blood pressure \nNocturnal dipping occurs when your blood pressure and pulse rate decrease during sleep. When you have diabetes, this doesn’t happen. This is called non-dipping.\n\n13. Heart palpitations\nThis is caused by a lack of potassium and magnesium and can be corrected with a good electrolyte powder.\n \n14. Teeth grinding \nThe activation of the sympathetic nervous system puts a person into a state of stress while they’re sleeping, causing teeth grinding. \n\n15. Headache upon waking\nThis usually occurs because of dehydration. \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 59, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting. He is the author of the best-selling book The Healthy Keto Plan, and is the Director of Dr. Berg Nutritionals.

His use of “doctor” or “Dr.” in relation to himself solely refers to that degree. Dr. Berg is a licensed chiropractor in Virginia, California, and Louisiana, but he no longer practices chiropractic in any state and does not see patients, so he can focus on educating people as a full-time activity, yet he maintains an active license.

    "description": "Do you know how diabetes develops? Let me explain. Diabetes is a condition where the glucose level in our blood starts to rise. Normally, a hormone called insulin, produced by the pancreas, helps regulate blood sugar. Insulin converts extra glucose in the blood into glycogen, keeping sugar levels balanced.\nBut in some people, the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin, or the body stops using it effectively. This causes glucose to build up in the blood instead of being converted. Over time, this condition leads to diabetes.\nIf left untreated, high blood sugar can cause serious health issues like nerve damage, kidney problems, and heart disease. That’s why early diagnosis is so crucial. Stay aware and take care\n#diabetesawareness #shorts",

Increased Thirst – High blood sugar dehydrates your body, making you feel constantly thirsty.\n2. Frequent Urination – Excess glucose forces your kidneys to work harder, leading to frequent trips to the bathroom, especially at night.\n3. Fatigue – When your body can’t use glucose for energy, you feel tired all the time.\n4. Increased Hunger – Your body demands more food to compensate for its lack of energy, even if you’ve eaten enough.\n5.

However, if it goes above this level, the blood sugar level will increase. Therefore, the term 'permanent cure' is not accurate for diabetes. The correct terms are diabetes reversal or diabetes remission. If your blood sugar is below a certain level, you can lead a normal life. However, if your glucose load exceeds your handling capacity, it means your blood sugar level will rise, leading to diabetes. Hence, the term 'permanent cure of diabetes' is not accurate. If you want more information on this topic, please type it in full in the comments below. \n\nDiabexy's mission is to eradicate diabetes from India like polio and it is possible with the help of knowledge and discipline that's why Diabexy makes educational videos, Diabexy makes food products that have very low glycemic load and also provides free consultations with medical doctors and dietitians.

(Only available in certain countries)\n► ► https://www.diabeticstalk.com/go/store\n------------------------------------------\n🔎 In today’s video, we’re going to look at 11 common signs of diabetes on the skin, including the basics of how they are treated. \n\n1️⃣1️⃣ Dry and Itchy Skin\nDry and itchy skin can be a sign of diabetes. This occurs because high blood sugar levels make the body lose fluids, leading to dry skin.  \n\nAnd when there is too much glucose in the cells, the body will not produce enough oil to keep the skin moisturized. The result? Itchy and flaky patches on your skin.\n\n🔟 Necrobiosis Lipoidica\nNecrobiosis Lipoidica is an inflammatory condition that is common with both insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. It can occur when collagen degenerates, and the walls of blood vessels thicken.\n\n9️⃣ Dark Patches on the Skin\nDark patches can be a sign of Acanthosis Nigricans, a common skin condition that can occur in people with diabetes or those who are overweight. It appears as a dark patch on the skin, which may be dry and often feels velvety to the touch. \n\nIt is most commonly found in areas such as the armpits, back of the neck, groin area, or elbows.\n\n8️⃣ Diabetic ulcers\nDiabetic ulcers are a common skin problem in people with diabetes. They are sores and open wounds, that often last a long time and struggle to heal. They can occur anywhere on the body, but most often develop on the feet and lower legs. \n\n7️⃣ Digital Sclerosis\nDigital Sclerosis is when the skin on your hands and feet becomes thick, firm, and cracked. It can also cause the joints to become stiff, making it difficult to move or do things like writing.\n\n6️⃣ Problematic Blisters\nDiabetics can also experience skin blisters, often on the feet and hands. They can appear quickly and may be a large single blister or groups of smaller ones.\n\n5️⃣ Skin tags\nSkin tags are small growths that can appear anywhere on the body. They can look like tiny, flesh-colored moles or dark spots and may be raised or flat. Diabetics are likely to get numerous skin tags due to high blood sugar levels or too much insulin. \n\n4️⃣ Xanthelasma\nXanthelasma are small yellow bumps, usually found on the upper or lower eyelids. They are made up of cholesterol deposits and can show up when diabetes is poorly controlled. They can also be an indicator of heart disease. \n\n3️⃣ Diabetic dermopathy\nDiabetic dermopathy is another skin condition which can occur in people with diabetes. It appears as light brown, scaly patches of skin on the legs and feet. They can also appear on the thighs, torso, and arms. \n\n2️⃣ Rashes and Skin Infections\nPeople with diabetes can be more prone to rashes and skin infections due to high levels of glucose in the blood. \n\nThe skin can often become dry, cracked, and itchy - leading to bacteria or fungi entering the body and causing infection. \n\n1️⃣ Eruptive Xanthomatosis \nEruptive xanthomatosis is a rare skin condition that appears in people with uncontrolled diabetes. \n\nThe bumps or lesions appear on the skin, usually around the buttocks, upper thighs, inside the elbow, and back of the knees. They can also appear on arms, legs, and shoulders, and are red with a yellow center.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n▶️ More Videos You Might Like:\n▪ Top 10 Anti-Diabetic Drinks  ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTYUkLi2xEE\n▪ 5 Yellow Foods That Reduce Blood Sugar ► https://youtu.be/VofCM_MHUN4\n▪ How To Bring Blood Sugar Down Quickly? ► https://youtu.be/kGUXpUMZ1O8\n▪ 6 Rice Alternatives For Blood Sugar Control ► https://youtu.be/MbbjA6Xh1Ts\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nDISCLAIMER: No part of this channel may be reproduced, transmitted, or distributed in any form or by any means, electrical or mechanical, including recording, or by any information storage or retrieval system without permission in writing from DiabeticsTalk.com.

    "description": "🦶Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) resulting from either insufficient insulin production or the body's inability to effectively use insulin.🦶\n\nType 1 Diabetes & Type 2 Diabetes Treatment Videos:\nTop 28 Diabetes Symptoms: https://youtu.be/8U9b36D43xI\n10 Best Diabetic Vitamins: https://youtu.be/sPihveT3oc0\nBest Diabetic Foods: https://youtu.be/jLID96VA7j0\nHow to know your heart is not well: https://youtu.be/qx4QAX2L4Fo\nVitamin D, Vitamin K2 & Magnesium: https://youtu.be/esTz-_Mpm4Q\nReverse Clogged Arteries: https://youtu.be/oNiZo0nO048\nDiabetic Neuropathy [Peripheral Neuropathy]: https://youtu.be/E_0ALrqYUSM\n\nBest Recommended Supplement Products in Video:\nhttps://www.michiganfootdoctors.com/supplements-for-neuropathy/\n\n The signs and symptoms of diabetes can vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. Here are common signs and symptoms associated with diabetes:\n\nIncreased thirst (polydipsia): Excessive thirst is a common symptom of diabetes. As blood sugar levels rise, the body tries to remove excess sugar through increased urination, leading to dehydration and increased thirst.\n\nFrequent urination (polyuria): High blood sugar levels cause the kidneys to work harder to filter and absorb glucose. This leads to increased urine production, resulting in more frequent trips to the bathroom, especially during the night (nocturia).\n\nFatigue: Persistent fatigue and lack of energy can be signs of diabetes. Elevated blood sugar levels can impair the body's ability to convert glucose into energy, leading to feelings of tiredness and exhaustion.\n\nUnexplained weight loss: In some cases, individuals with diabetes may experience unexplained weight loss despite increased appetite. This can occur due to the body's inability to properly utilize glucose and break down fats and proteins for energy.\n\nIncreased hunger (polyphagia): Despite eating more, individuals with diabetes may experience persistent hunger. This is because the body's cells are not receiving adequate glucose, which leads to feelings of hunger.\n\nBlurred vision: High blood sugar levels can affect the lens of the eye, causing blurred vision. This symptom may resolve once blood sugar levels are controlled.\n\nSlow wound healing: Diabetes can impair the body's ability to heal wounds, cuts, and infections. High blood sugar levels can affect blood circulation and the immune system's response, leading to delayed wound healing.\n\nNumbness or tingling: Prolonged high blood sugar levels can cause damage to the nerves, resulting in peripheral neuropathy. This condition commonly affects the feet and hands, leading to numbness, tingling, or a burning sensation.\n\nRecurrent infections: Diabetes can weaken the immune system, making individuals more prone to infections. Common infections associated with diabetes include urinary tract infections, skin infections, and yeast infections.\n👉 Shoes 👈\nBest Shoes:\nhttps://www.michiganfootdoctors.com/podiatrist-recommended-shoes/\n\nBest Products: https://www.michiganfootdoctors.com/recommended-products/\n\n📢Come See Us in Detroit, Michigan, Berkley Michigan; Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, Lansing Michigan; and Grand Blanc Michigan📢\n\nIf you are in Michigan, consider seeing us at our clinic: https://www.michiganfootdoctors.com/.\nhttps://g.page/r/CaxJ9b-O6o27EAE\n\n👉 LINKS 👈\nDisclaimer: This video and description contain affiliate links, which means we may receive a commission if you click on one of the product links.

However, if it goes above this level, the blood sugar level will increase. Therefore, the term 'permanent cure' is not accurate for diabetes. The correct terms are diabetes reversal or diabetes remission. If your blood sugar is below a certain level, you can lead a normal life. However, if your glucose load exceeds your handling capacity, it means your blood sugar level will rise, leading to diabetes. Hence, the term 'permanent cure of diabetes' is not accurate.

You may please ask your questions by clicking on the above link and submitting your queries.  \n\n🤔 Why does fasting blood sugar decrease slowly? \n\nThe reason fasting blood sugar decreases gradually is that blood sugar levels do not remain constant in the body. Our body follows a circadian rhythm, and this internal clock resets around 4 AM. This reset allows the pancreas to capture the circulating insulin and clear the blood sugar. As the liver pulls in this insulin, the pancreas starts pumping fresh insulin. This process doesn't have a significant impact on blood sugar levels. However, in diabetic patients, the pancreas is weakened. While the liver continues its function of pulling in the excess insulin, the pancreas fails to release fresh insulin. This leads to a decrease in insulin levels in the body, while the level of glucagon, which is insulin's opposite, increases. Glucagon then converts the fat stored in the liver into sugar, releasing new glucose into the bloodstream and causing blood sugar levels to rise.   \n\nDiabexy's mission is to eradicate diabetes from India like polio and it is possible with the help of knowledge and discipline that's why Diabexy makes educational videos, Diabexy makes food products that have very low glycemic load and also provides free consultations with medical doctors and dietitians.

If you find yourself peeing frequently and feeling thirsty all the time, it could be a sign of diabetes. Stay tuned to learn more about these common warning signs and how to manage them. Remember, early detection is key to effectively managing diabetes and maintaining your overall health. Watch now to stay informed about diabetes symptoms\n\nHigh Blood Sugar Levels: In diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces (Type 2 diabetes). This leads to elevated blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). The kidneys attempt to remove the excess glucose from the blood by filtering it out into the urine. This excess glucose in the urine pulls water along with it, leading to increased urine production (polyuria).\n\nDehydration: Increased urination can result in dehydration, which triggers the sensation of thirst. The body tries to replenish lost fluids by making you feel thirsty.\n#Diabetes #FrequentUrination #HighBloodSugar #DiabetesSymptoms #HealthTips",

    "description": "Learn more a list of the best foods for type 2 diabetic patients to eat daily. This diabetes food list should be tailored specifically to what your body needs in your diabetes diet.  We’re going to show you some of type 2 diabetes-friendly foods and snacks that you can choose from. These should include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, protein, and healthy fats. Eating these healthy foods not only improves your health but also helps ease the symptoms of diabetes. \n\n✅  NOTE ✅ \nPlease note that while the foods listed in this video may be beneficial for individuals with diabetes, it is important to consume them in moderation and as part of a healthy, balanced diet. We recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to determine the appropriate amount of these foods for your individual dietary needs.\n\n============================\n❤️ SECRET from FORMER Diabetics\nHERE: https://healthtipsinfo.site/reverse-diabetes\n============================\n\nThis is a list of the best foods for diabetic patients to eat daily, including:\n\n1. Olive oil\nThere is a big misconception that if you have type 2 diabetes, you cannot have any fats in your diet. This is false because unsaturated fats are essential for a person with type 2 diabetes.\n\n2. Nuts & Seeds\nFrequent nut and seed consumption can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This is because they are high in fiber, protein, and healthy fats, which can help control blood sugar levels.\n\n3. Eggs\nEggs and other protein-rich foods can be an important part of a diet for people with diabetes. They can help regulate blood sugar levels and prevent severe spikes in the short term. \n\n4. Peanut Butter\nOne of daily foods for diabetes is peanut butter. Some people find that peanut butter is an excellent substitute for refined carbohydrates like white bread and sugar. \n\n5. Green Vegetables\nPeople with diabetes should eat more green vegetables like spinach, cabbage, or kale, to reduce their risk of developing complications associated with diabetes.\n\n6. Cinnamon\nSome research has found that cinnamon can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar levels in people who have type 2 diabetes. \n\n7. Dark Chocolate\nDark chocolate is one of the best type 2 diabetes foods to eat daily. \n\n8. Beans and lentils\nBeans and lentils have a low GI, meaning they release their sugars into the bloodstream slower than most other foods. \n\n9.  Brown rice\nBrown rice is a whole grain that provides fiber and some vitamins and minerals. White rice is a refined grain that has fiber and many minerals removed, making it softer. \n\n10. Avocado\nAvocado contains monounsaturated fatty acids, which are good for managing blood sugar levels and insulin resistance. \n\nThat's a roundup of some of the best foods for diabetic patients to eat to maintain a healthy lifestyle and take care of diabetes.\n\n#type2diabetes \n#diabetesfoods #diabetescontrol #diabetesawareness #diabetic #diabetescure #diabetes #bloodsugarcontrol #bloodsugar #bloodsugarbalance #diabeticfoods #diabeticpatienttips #lowerbloodsugar  #diabetestype2 ##diabeticdiet #dietfordiabetes \n#foodfordiabetes #diabetestreatment \n\n===================================== \nFAIR USE COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER:\nThe Copyright Laws of the United States recognizes a “fair use” of copyrighted content.

Food plays a crucial role in determining how much your blood sugar increases. The question is: how can we know how much a particular food will raise our blood sugar levels?\n\nIf we want to control our blood sugar without medication, we should follow these three important guidelines:\n\n✅ The total EGL for the entire day should not exceed 25. To achieve this, we should avoid whole grains and rice, and instead use Diabexy atta rather than regular atta, as the EGL of Diabexy atta is 7, while the EGL of regular atta is approximately 50.\n✅ Eating episodes should not exceed 3 or 4 times per day.\n\n✅Total daily EGL must remain under 25, it’s equally crucial that the EGL per meal does not exceed 10. \n\nBy following these guidelines, you can manage diabetes effortlessly without needing medication.  \n\nDiabexy products are specially designed for diabetics. They help in managing blood sugar levels while supplementing your daily nutritional requirements. With over a decade of research and development to develop low glycemic load food products, we believe that it is possible to reverse diabetes (डायबिटीज रेवेर्सल) with the help of healthy eating habits and disciplined lifestyle.\n\nAt Diabexy, we believe it is possible to reverse diabetes with the support of knowledge and discipline.

Many individuals are often confused about these terms, but understanding them is crucial for managing diabetes effectively.\n\nDiabetes remission refers to a state where blood sugar levels are controlled without the need for medications or insulin. This can be achieved through significant lifestyle changes, such as adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight loss. However, it's important to note that diabetes can still return if these lifestyle changes are not maintained.\n\nOn the other hand, diabetes reversal goes beyond remission. It signifies a state where the body's insulin production and sensitivity are restored to a level where diabetes is no longer present. This is often achieved through intensive lifestyle interventions, such as very low-calorie diets or bariatric surgery, which can lead to substantial weight loss and significant improvements in insulin function.\n\nIn this video, we'll explore the strategies for both remission and reversal, including the challenges and benefits associated with each approach. Whether you're living with diabetes or supporting someone who is, understanding these concepts can empower you to make informed decisions about managing the condition and improving overall health. \n\nDiabexy's mission is to eradicate diabetes from India like polio and it is possible with the help of knowledge and discipline that's why Diabexy makes educational videos, Diabexy makes food products that have very low glycemic load and also provides free consultations with medical doctors and dietitians. So if you also believe that diabetes can be eradicated then we can work together to eradicate diabetes from India.\n\nDiabexy products are specially designed for diabetics. They help in managing blood sugar levels while supplementing your daily nutritional requirements. With over a decade of research and development to develop low glycemic load food products, we believe that it is possible to reverse diabetes (डायबिटीज रेवेर्सल) with the help of healthy eating habits and disciplined lifestyle.\n\nAt Diabexy, we believe it is possible to reverse diabetes with the support of knowledge and discipline.

    "description": "People with diabetes need to be mindful of their diet because certain foods can significantly impact blood sugar levels. Here are 10 Foods Diabetics Should Never Eat (Avoid Them at All Costs) as much as possible. Here's why:\n\n✔️ Blood Sugar Control: Diabetes disrupts the body's ability to regulate blood sugar (glucose). \n\n✔️ Insulin: People with type 1 diabetes don't produce enough insulin, a hormone that helps cells absorb glucose for energy.\n\n✔️ Insulin Resistance: In type 2 diabetes, the body becomes less responsive to insulin, meaning glucose can't enter cells effectively.\nFood Impact:\n\n✅ Carbohydrates: These break down into glucose, the primary source of energy for the body. Consuming too many carbs can cause a rapid spike in blood sugar.\n\n✅ Sugary Foods: Processed foods, sugary drinks, and sweets are high in added sugars, leading to significant blood sugar fluctuations.\n\n✅ Unhealthy Fats: Saturated and trans fats can increase insulin resistance and contribute to heart disease, a common complication of diabetes.\n\nI hope you learn much from this video and begin to avoid them for better blood sugar management.

Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.\n\n#diabetes #health",

    "description": "Hi, I’m Dr. Jason Fung, and welcome to Part 3 of the Diabetes Code Clinic, where we focus on reversing Type 2 diabetes through proven methods. If you missed Parts 1 and 2, I recommend watching those first, as we discussed what Type 2 diabetes is and introduced the low carbohydrate diet.\n\nIn today’s video, we’re diving deeper into the low carbohydrate diet and why it’s one of the most effective approaches for reversing Type 2 diabetes. The key to managing this disease lies in understanding how blood glucose levels are affected by what you eat. Using tools like the glycemic index and glycemic load, you can identify foods that raise your blood sugar and those that don’t.\n\nYou’ll learn:\n✔️ Why cutting carbohydrates is essential for managing diabetes\n✔️ The difference between refined and natural carbohydrates\n✔️ How foods like vegetables, proteins, and healthy fats can stabilize blood sugar\n✔️ Easy swaps and practical tips to stick to a low-carb diet\n✔️ What happens if your blood sugar drops too low—and how to handle it\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  \nTimestamps for Easy Navigation:\n⏱️ 00:00 Topics to be covered today\n⏱️ 00:27 Low carbohydrate diet\n⏱️ 01:20 Foods that raise or don’t raise blood glucose\n⏱️ 03:21 Glycemic index of foods\n⏱️ 06:44 Reports on low-carb diets\n⏱️ 08:50 Very low carbohydrate foods\n⏱️ 09:17 What to eat on a very low-carb diet?\n⏱️ 10:27 What if my blood glucose goes down?\n⏱️ 10:59 Ending\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  \n\nKey Points:\n✅ Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body is overwhelmed with glucose, causing blood sugar levels to rise.\n✅ A low carbohydrate diet targets the root cause—excess glucose—by reducing sugar intake and prioritizing foods that don’t spike blood sugar.\n✅ Using tools like the glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load, you can make informed choices about what to eat.\n✅ Refined carbs (like bread and cornflakes) spike blood sugar, while natural carbs (like carrots and cauliflower) have a much lower impact.\n✅ Incorporating low-carb, high-protein foods such as chicken, beef, eggs, and non-starchy vegetables can significantly improve blood glucose levels.\n\nTips for Following a Low-Carb Diet:\n1️⃣ Choose Whole Foods: Focus on natural, unprocessed foods.\n2️⃣ Fill Your Plate Smartly: Half with non-starchy vegetables, half with proteins.\n3️⃣ Try Low-Carb Substitutes: Use lettuce wraps, cauliflower rice, or konjac noodles instead of bread and traditional pasta.\n4️⃣ Monitor Your Blood Sugar: If you’re on diabetes medication, consult your doctor to adjust dosages as needed.\n\nBenefits of a Low-Carb Diet:\n📉 Reduces blood sugar levels and HbA1c\n⚖️ Promotes weight loss\n💊 Reduces dependency on diabetes medications\n✔️ Scientifically backed by organizations like the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Heart Association (AHA)\n\nWhy Watch This Video?\nIf you or a loved one is struggling with Type 2 diabetes, this video provides actionable insights to start reversing the disease naturally.

    "description": "🤔 Did you know that Metformin & other diabetes medications can deplete your body of three crucial nutrients?\n\n👉 Vitamin B12 is essential for cellular energy, and without it, your energy levels can drop.\n👉 Folate, or folic acid, is key for DNA synthesis and cell repair, so a lack of it hinders healing and proper cell function.\n👉 Coenzyme Q10, or CoQ10, is vital for muscle strength and energy, and its depletion can cause muscle weakness, pain, and fatigue.\n\nI am so passionate about this topic because rates of insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and diabetes have absolutely skyrocketed in our country – and so have the perscriptions for these medications.\n\nBut the reality is there are so many natural, holistic techniques you can use to battle sugar-related disease. \n\nIf you want to learn about my top tactics to battle insulin resistance at a LIVE virtual, comment HEAL to join me and Dr. Will Cole on August 12th for our free event A Day to Heal.\n\nYou don't have to stay dependent on medication. Share this with someone you know who is struggling with one of these diagnoses.\n\n#Nutrient #Vitamin #Diabetes #HealthJourney #TakeControl #drjoshaxe\n\n--------------------\nABOUT DR.

Doing so will prevent diabetes burnouts\n\nTreat your cuts and burns with @Lavior Diabetic first aid gel: It is important to take care of wounds living with diabetes. First aid gel is formulated to prevent infection and relieves pain and itch. It gives relief and promotes healing of cuts, scrapes, burns, sunburns.\n\nHeal your dark marks from diabetes devices with Lavior Diabetic wound dressing: It creates optimal environment for wound healing and promotes skin regeneration. I like to apply the wound dressing to the red marks right after site change.\n\n#skincare #diabetes #type1diabetes #typ2diabetes #diabeteseducation #diabetesawareness",

    "description": "Our children are being fed toxic chemicals, ultra-processed junk, and excessive sugar—all under the guise of “nutrition.”\n\nThe science is clear: many of the additives found in school meals are linked to cancer, reproductive harm, hormone disruption, and DNA damage. They serve no nutritional purpose—only to extend shelf life, enhance color, and modify texture.\n\nMeanwhile, childhood obesity has increased by 400% in the last 40 years. Type 2 diabetes in adolescents has surged 200% in just two decades. 1 in 4 teenagers has prediabetes. ADHD diagnoses have skyrocketed 800%, and autism rates have gone from 4 in 10,000 to 1 in 36.\n\nThis isn’t normal. This isn’t genetic. This is a food problem.\n\nEurope bans thousands of chemicals we allow in our food. Why aren’t we asking why?\n\nOur kids deserve better. That’s why I’m fighting for SB 314, a bill that bans some of the worst chemicals from public school meals—because no child should be forced to eat food that puts their health at risk.\n\nIt’s time to wake up. Food is the root cause of our crisis—and it must be the solution.",

    "title": "Should a diabetic prefer walking or gym exercise?",
    "description": "Both walking and gym workouts are beneficial for diabetes management, but they serve different purposes. Here’s how you can balance both for better blood sugar control and overall health.\n\n🚶‍♂️ Walking & Stair Climbing After Meals – A Must for Diabetics!\n🔹 Why? After eating, blood sugar levels tend to rise. Light activity like walking or stair climbing helps:\n✔️ Lower post-meal blood sugar (PPBS) naturally\n✔️ Improve insulin sensitivity\n✔️ Enhance digestion and prevent glucose spikes\n\n💡 Best Practice:\n✅ Walk for 10-15 minutes after each meal or do 2-5 minutes of stair climbing (even 3 flights of stairs help!).\n✅ Walking before bed can prevent overnight sugar spikes.\n\n🏋️‍♂️ Gym Exercise / Yoga – Strength Training is a Game Changer!\n🔹 Why? Gym workouts or yoga for 40-60 minutes daily can:\n✔️ Build muscle (muscles absorb glucose better than fat)\n✔️ Burn extra sugar and stored fat\n✔️ Improve metabolism and reduce insulin resistance\n\n💡 Best Routine:\n✅ Strength Training (3-4x per week) – Use weights or bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, and push-ups.\n✅ Yoga & Flexibility (2-3x per week) – Improves insulin function and reduces stress.\n✅ HIIT or Cardio (1-2x per week) – Short bursts of high-intensity workouts help regulate blood sugar fast.\n\n🏆 Best Exercise Plan for Diabetics\n🔹 Daily: Walk for 10-15 min after meals OR do stair climbing\n🔹 Once a day: Gym exercise OR Yoga for 40-60 min\n🔹 Mix both: Walking + Strength Training + Yoga/Cardio is the best combo!\n\n🚀 Conclusion:\nBoth walking and gym workouts are essential! Do post-meal walks or stair climbing daily and dedicate 40-60 min to either gym or yoga for long-term diabetes control.\n\nLonglivelives is a Health channel that features Dr Sanjeev Agrawal an MD Ortho and a Diabetes Coach & Nutritionist Vishal Agrawal who talk about remission and reversal of chronic health ailments.\n\nDr Sanjeev Agrawal works primarily on Arthritis Remission and Diabetes Control & Reversal, whereas Vishal Agrawal focuses on making the weight loss journey of 45+ people easier.\n\nOur mission is to make India become a healthy country.

    "title": "Is papaya or papita safe for diabetes patients?",
    "description": "Is Papaya (Papita) Safe for Diabetes Patients?\n✅ Yes, papaya is safe for diabetics when consumed in moderation. It has moderate carbohydrates and a low glycemic index (GI) of around 60, meaning it won’t spike blood sugar drastically. However, portion control is key!\n\n📌 Why Is Papaya Good for Diabetics?\n🍈 Moderate Carbohydrates – A 100g serving of papaya contains 11g of carbs, which is lower than many high-GI fruits like bananas or mangoes.\n🌿 Rich in Fiber – Papaya contains 2.5g of fiber per 100g, which helps slow down sugar absorption and prevents sudden glucose spikes.\n🛡️ Antioxidants & Vitamins – It is packed with vitamin C, A, and flavonoids, which support immune function and reduce inflammation.\n\n⚠️ How Much Papaya Can a Diabetic Eat?\n🔹 Stick to 100-150g per serving (about a small bowl or 3-4 medium slices).\n🔹 Avoid eating papaya with other high-carb foods to prevent a blood sugar spike.\n🔹 Best time to eat? As a mid-morning snack or post-meal dessert with protein/fat to slow down sugar absorption.\n\n🥇 Is Guava Better Than Papaya for Diabetics?\n✅ Yes! Guava is a better choice because:\n✔️ Lower glycemic index (~24-40) than papaya\n✔️ Higher fiber (5.4g per 100g), making it even better for blood sugar control\n✔️ More vitamin C, which helps in reducing oxidative stress in diabetics\n\nIf you are choosing between papaya and guava, guava is the better option for diabetics due to its higher fiber and lower sugar content.\n\n🛑 Avoid Papaya If:\n🚫 You consume too much fruit in one sitting (excess carbs = blood sugar spikes)\n🚫 You have poorly controlled diabetes or insulin resistance\n🚫 You eat it along with high-GI fruits like mango, banana, or dates\n\n✅ Final Verdict: Should Diabetics Eat Papaya?\n🔹 Yes, in moderation! Papaya is a good fruit choice but should be eaten in safe limits.\n🔹 Guava is a better alternative due to its higher fiber content and lower glycemic impact.\n🔹 Always monitor blood sugar levels after consuming fruit to see how your body responds.\n\n💬 Which fruit do you prefer—papaya or guava?

    "description": "Want to know how to reverse diabetes naturally? Here are 3 powerful strategies to manage blood sugar levels effectively.\n\n 1. Food Sequencing: Eat your veggies first, followed by protein and fats, and save carbs for last. This helps control blood sugar spikes by slowing down carb absorption, which keeps insulin levels steady.\n 2. Exercise and Weight Training: Regular exercise, especially weight training, is key to improving insulin sensitivity. By building muscle, you help your body use glucose more effectively and reduce blood sugar levels naturally.\n 3. Use a CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor): A CGM patch helps you track your blood sugar in real-time, so you know exactly which foods trigger spikes and which keep you stable. This personalized insight can be a game-changer in managing diabetes.\n\nWatch until the end to learn how these simple habits can transform your health journey!",

    "title": "AVENA Y DIABETES 🥣🛑 5 ERRORES frecuentes al consumir AVENA",
    "description": "📢 Masterclass GRATIS – Los Enemigos de la Glucosa 🎉\n👉🏼 Link para inscribirte: http://bit.ly/4kPzLd7\n\nDescubre cómo ciertos alimentos afectan tu glucosa y qué hacer para controlarla. Aprenderás:\n✔️ ¿Qué son y cómo afectan los carbohidratos?\n✔️ Los verdaderos enemigos de la glucosa\n✔️ La tríada Glucosa - Insulina - Triglicéridos\n\n🗓️ Martes 1 de abril | ⏰ 8 PM MEX | 9 PM COL\n\n🎁 BONO: Regístrate y recibe GRATIS una guía de los carbohidratos de mejor calidad para tu salud.\n\n👉🏼 Reserva tu lugar aquí: http://bit.ly/4kPzLd7\n\n\n___\n\nLa avena es rica en fibra, especialmente en fibra soluble, que ayuda a regular el azúcar en sangre y a mejorar la digestión. La fibra soluble puede ralentizar la absorción de glucosa, lo que puede ser beneficioso para las personas con diabetes.\n\nEl índice glucémico es una medida de cuán rápido un alimento aumenta el nivel de glucosa en sangre. Los alimentos con un IG bajo se digieren y absorben más lentamente, lo que puede ayudar a controlar los niveles de azúcar en sangre. La avena integral tiene un IG moderado, por lo que puede ser una opción adecuada para las personas con diabetes, siempre que se consuma con moderación y se sigan algunas pautas.\n\nBetaglucanos y su impacto en la salud\n\nLos betaglucanos son un tipo de fibra soluble presente en la avena, que se ha relacionado con beneficios para la salud cardiovascular y el control de la glucosa en sangre. Estudios científicos han demostrado que los betaglucanos pueden ayudar a reducir el colesterol LDL (colesterol malo) y a mejorar la sensibilidad a la insulina, lo que podría ser beneficioso para las personas con diabetes.\n\nRecomendaciones para consumir avena en caso de diabetes\n\nEvitar la avena instantánea: La avena instantánea de Quaker, por ejemplo, suele tener menos fibra que la avena integral. Opta por avena integral, que es menos procesada y contiene más fibra.\n\nAsegurarse de que sea integral: La avena integral debe tener un aspecto más oscuro y menos uniforme que la avena refinada.\n\nAcompañar con grasas saludables o proteínas: Combinar la avena con grasas saludables (como nueces o almendras) o proteínas (como yogurt griego) puede ayudar a reducir su índice glucémico y a mantener estables los niveles de azúcar en sangre.\n\nEvitar la fruta cocida: La fruta cocida puede aumentar el IG de la avena, por lo que es mejor evitarla.\n\nElegir versiones sin azúcar: Algunas marcas de avena ofrecen opciones sin azúcar. Asegúrate de elegir estas opciones para evitar un consumo excesivo de azúcares.\n\nCombinar con ingredientes adecuados: Mezcla la avena con leche vegetal, nueces, almendras, frutos rojos o fresas para obtener un desayuno equilibrado y nutritivo. También puedes combinarla con chía y dejarla remojando para potenciar sus beneficios.\n\nEvitar la avena refinada: La avena también puede estar refinada, lo que disminuye su contenido de fibra y aumenta su índice glucémico. Opta por la avena integral siempre que sea posible.\n\nTener cuidado al cocinar la avena: Cocinar la avena puede elevar su índice glucémico. Considera remojarla en agua o yogurt griego en lugar de cocinarla.\n\nConsumir avena con moderación: A pesar de sus beneficios, la avena sigue siendo una fuente de carbohidratos. Si tienes diabetes, es importante consumirla con moderación y ajustar su ingesta según tus necesidades nutricionales y los consejos de tu médico o dietista.\n\nEvitar ciertos tipos de avena: Algunas variedades de avena, como la granola, suelen contener azúcares añadidos, grasas y frutos secos en exceso. Estos ingredientes pueden aumentar su índice glucémico, por lo que es mejor evitarlos.\n\nSer creativo con recetas saludables: Puedes preparar hot cakes de avena con huevo, o incluso un pastel de zanahoria saludable usando avena integral. Esto te permitirá disfrutar de la avena de diversas maneras sin comprometer tu salud.",

LDCF diet is basically low in carbs, moderate in fats and high in protein. LDCF diet helps to reverse diabetes and also fat loss.\nType 2 diabetes can be controlled and reversed by having a low-carb diet. The concept is very simple carbohydrates provide us with instant energy and the fat is stored in our body and gradually we increase our weight but in low density carbohydrate and fat diet we have to lower the carb intakes and keep the fat and protein intake moderate and high respectively. By doing this the fat stored in our body will burn to provide energy to us for our day to day activity and eventually we will lose weight.  Foods high in carbohydrates, such as breads, pastas, starchy vegetables and sweetened beverages, should be restricted when following an LDCF diet plan.

    "title": "El TRUCO para REDUCIR AZÚCAR NATURALMENTE y prevenir DIABETES",
    "description": "¿Sabías que mantener un nivel adecuado de azúcar en sangre es fundamental para evitar múltiples enfermedades? La glucosa elevada en sangre puede desencadenar problemas de salud serios, como trombosis cerebrales, infarto, hígado graso, ansiedad, síndrome de ovario poliquístico, prediabetes, diabetes, y hasta cáncer. Controlar los niveles de glucosa es más que una necesidad; es una forma de proteger tu salud en general.\n\n¡Baja el azúcar en sangre SIN REMEDIOS! | Diabetes tratamiento natural. Lo primero y más importante es adoptar una alimentación consciente. Eliminar de tu dieta los azúcares, jarabes, mieles y alimentos altos en almidón como arroz, papa, yuca, plátano, y pasta es esencial. Optar por carbohidratos provenientes de vegetales y consumir alimentos en un orden que priorice los vegetales puede hacer una gran diferencia.\n\n¿Por qué es vital reducir el consumo de ciertos tipos de carbohidratos? Al consumir primero vegetales y luego proteínas, permites que tu cuerpo maneje mejor los niveles de glucosa. Si aún tienes hambre después de una comida, es mejor optar por más proteínas en lugar de carbohidratos adicionales. Este enfoque no solo ayuda a mantener los niveles de glucosa bajos, sino que también te deja más satisfecho y con menos probabilidad de tener picos de glucosa después de comer.\n\n¿Cómo puede ayudarte el ejercicio en la regulación del azúcar en sangre? Combinar ejercicios de fuerza con cardio es la estrategia más eficaz. El ejercicio de fuerza ayuda a mejorar la capacidad de tus músculos para utilizar glucosa, lo que reduce la cantidad circulante en tu sangre. Mantener una buena masa muscular es crucial, ya que el músculo es uno de los principales consumidores de glucosa en el cuerpo.\n\n¿Qué otros factores debes considerar para controlar tu glucosa? El manejo del estrés es fundamental. El estrés, tanto mental como físico, puede aumentar los niveles de glucosa en sangre al elevar hormonas como el cortisol y la adrenalina. Aprender a manejar el estrés eficazmente puede prevenir estos picos de glucosa y ayudarte a mantener un metabolismo saludable.\n\n¿Existen suplementos que pueden ayudarte a manejar mejor la glucosa? Sí, algunos suplementos como el vinagre de manzana, la berberina, el inositol y el magnesio han demostrado ser útiles para mejorar los niveles de glucosa. Sin embargo, es crucial que cualquier suplemento se tome bajo supervisión médica y como complemento a una dieta saludable y un estilo de vida activo.\n\nEncuentra las proteínas aquí: https://bit.ly/ProductosAmazonCJ\n\n0:00 ¿Quieres controlar el azúcar en la sangre?\n1:32 Tus células necesitan esto\n2:13 ¿Qué pasa con el azúcar aumentada en sangre?\n3:17 Estos son los alimentos que debes sacar de tu dieta\n4:44 La importancia de comer en ventanas de tiempo\n5:16 Importancia del ejercicio\n6:43 El exceso de estrés no te ayuda\n8:02 Cuidado con las hormonas\n8:58 Esto es lo que debes hacer\n9:35 Qué suplementos / complementos puedes incluir\n11:40 La gran conclusión\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n🔥CONVIÉRTETE EN MIEMBRO EXCLUSIVO Y DISFRUTA DE VENTAJAS ÚNICAS🔥: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCykTiaMobl2EWW28zmjcznQ/join\n-\nMi página web oficial\nhttps://drcarlosjaramillo.com/\n-\nADQUIERE MIS LIBROS Y SUPLEMENTOS AQUÍ: https://shop.medicinafuncional.co/\n-\nPRODUCTOS EN AMAZON: \nhttps://bit.ly/ProductosAmazonCJ\n\n https://shop.medicinafuncional.co/categoria-producto/externos/\n-\nCONOCE LAS MEJORES PROTEÍNAS Y SUPLEMENTOS EN SAVVY: https://bit.ly/2ML3khs\n-\nEl Dr. Carlos Jaramillo y el Instituto de Medicina Funcional buscan que siempre tengas buenos hábitos y ante todo claridad sobre cómo las decisiones diarias producen gran parte de las enfermedades que hoy tiene la humanidad.\n\nEl Dr. Carlos Jaramillo publica estos videos con fines educativos más no representa ninguna recomendación terapéutica para ninguna persona por lo cual el seguimiento de sus indicaciones es responsabilidad individual, y no responsabilidad del creador del contenido.

Apples, berries and citrus fruits are also great options to regularly include in your diet.\n\nWhat is a good breakfast for insulin resistance?\nStart your day with a nutritious breakfast with protein, healthy fats, and fiber. Breakfast ideas for insulin resistance include: Vegetable omelet: Make a veggie stuffed omelet with eggs, spinach, tomatoes, and red bell peppers.\n\nDoes lemon reduce insulin resistance?\nLemons are good for you, and many alternative practitioners contend that they can help stabilize blood sugar.

    "description": "#biomedicina #patologia #diabetes \nDiabetes mellitus é uma doença crônica caracterizada pela hiperglicemia, que ocorre devido à produção insuficiente de insulina ou à resistência das células à ação desse hormônio. Existem dois principais tipos: o tipo 1, que resulta da destruição autoimune das células beta do pâncreas, e o tipo 2, relacionado à resistência à insulina e à insuficiência relativa na sua produção. O diagnóstico é feito por exames laboratoriais que medem os níveis de glicose no sangue, como glicemia de jejum, hemoglobina glicada e teste de tolerância à glicose. A fisiopatologia envolve desequilíbrios no metabolismo da glicose e disfunções nos hormônios insulina e glucagon, responsáveis por regular os níveis de glicose no corpo.\n\nNosso perfil no instagram: https://www.instagram.com/patologia.facil/\nNosso perfil no Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@patologia_facil?lang=pt_BR",

    "title": "Hva er diabetes?",
    "description": "Insulin er et hormon som produseres i bukspyttkjertelen og som har som hovedoppgave å senke blodsukkeret. Insulinet fungerer som en «nøkkel» som låser opp cellene slik at glukose (sukker) kommer inn i cellene og kan brukes som energi i kroppen. \n\nVed diabetes type 2, så produserer kroppen enten for lite insulin i forhold til behovet og/eller det insulinet som produseres virker dårligere i kroppen og klarer ikke å åpne opp cellene. Da blir sukkeret liggende i blodet, og fører til høyt blodsukker. \n\nNår man har fått diabetes type 1, så produserer ikke kroppen noe insulin og blodsukkeret blir veldig høyt. Man kan ha litt insulinproduksjon helt i starten av sykdomsforløpet, men denne produksjonen vil stoppe opp etter en tid. \nDiabetes type 1 og type 2 er to forskjellige sykdommer. Felles for dem begge er at svekket insulinfunksjon medfører høyt blodsukker og at sykdommene er kroniske.\n\nDenne videoen er utviklet med økonomisk støtte fra Damstiftelsen.",

E o pré-diabetes afeta assustadores 40 milhões de brasileiros. No diabetes o corpo não produz insulina suficiente ou não usa adequadamente a insulina que produz. Insulina é um hormônio produzido pelo pâncreas e ajuda a glicose (o açúcar) a entrar nas células para fornecer energia.

E isso tem um grande valor, porque muita gente com diabetes não sabe que tem a doença. Quanto mais cedo se descobre, melhor. \nSe a pessoa for pré-diabética pode evitar que torne diabético. E se for diabético inicial, a pessoa pode evitar que a doença complique. É importante que a glicose do sangue seja bem controlada para diminuir o risco de desenvolver complicações associadas ao diabetes.\n\nQuando a pessoa tem diabetes, o corpo não produz insulina suficiente, que é um hormônio que faz o açúcar entrar para dentro da célula, ou não a utiliza adequadamente, sendo pouco sensível ou resistente à insulina. \n\nNesse vídeo, apresentamos os 9 sintomas mais frequentes de diabetes e pré-diabetes que aparecem à noite.

    "description": "Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.\n\nIn 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years. Another 460 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and raised blood glucose causes around 20% of cardiovascular deaths (1).\n\nBetween 2000 and 2019, there was a 3% increase in age-standardized mortality rates from diabetes. In lower-middle-income countries, the mortality rate due to diabetes increased 13%.\n\nBy contrast, the probability of dying from any one of the four main noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases or diabetes) between the ages of 30 and 70 decreased by 22% globally between 2000 and 2019. \n\n ———————————\n\nWatch videos -\n\n1.

(Lower Blood Sugar)\n\nManaging diabetes effectively requires more than just avoiding certain foods—it’s about making smart dietary choices that actively support blood sugar control. For diabetics, incorporating the right vegetables into daily meals can significantly improve insulin sensitivity and overall metabolic health. Some vegetables, like Brussels sprouts, spinach, and broccoli, are rich in fiber, antioxidants, and bioactive compounds that help stabilize glucose levels.\n\nFor diabetics, vegetables like cabbage, tomatoes, and cucumbers provide essential vitamins and minerals that support heart health and reduce inflammation. Avocados, packed with healthy fats, are another excellent choice for improving insulin sensitivity and preventing blood sugar spikes. These nutrient-dense foods help diabetics regulate glucose absorption while reducing the risk of diabetes-related complications.\n\nChoosing fresh, steamed, or lightly sautéed vegetables with healthy fats like olive oil can maximize their benefits. A well-balanced diet, along with regular exercise and stress management, is crucial for diabetics seeking stable blood sugar levels.\n\nIf you found this information helpful, don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more tips on managing diabetes naturally! 🚀💚\n\nTime Stamps:\nIntroduction\n1:21 Brussels Sprouts \n3:13 Spinach\n5:12 Broccoli\n7:09 Cabbage\n9:07 Tomatoes\n10:58 Cucumbers\n12:50 Arugula\n14:48 Avocados\n16:42 Broccoli \n18:39 A Holistic Approach to Blood Sugar Control Through Nutrition\n\n#diabetics #diabetesdiet #diabeteshealth #lowerbloodsugars",

Gestational diabetes can develop even if you’ve never had diabetes before. If left unchecked, it can affect both you and your baby. Here are six early signs that your blood sugar might be too high during pregnancy.\n\n🔹 Top 6 Signs of High Blood Sugar in Pregnancy\n✔️ Excessive Thirst – Feeling constantly thirsty, even after drinking plenty of water.\n✔️ Frequent Urination – Needing to pee more often, especially waking up at night to urinate.\n✔️ Extreme Fatigue – Feeling unusually tired, drained, or weak despite resting well.\n✔️ Blurred Vision – Sudden vision changes, such as blurriness or trouble focusing.\n✔️ Increased Hunger – Feeling hungry all the time, even after eating.\n✔️ Frequent Infections – More yeast infections, UTIs, or slow healing of cuts and wounds.\n\n⭐ What to Do Next?\nIf you notice these signs, consult your doctor immediately. A simple glucose test can confirm if your sugar levels are high. Managing blood sugar with a healthy diet, exercise, and medical guidance can help keep you and your baby safe.\n\nHave you experienced any of these symptoms?

    "description": "Symptomer på diabetes varierer, både i rekkefølge og styrke. Generelt er symptomene på diabetes type 1 tydeligere enn ved diabetes type 2. Dette er de mest vanlige symptomene på diabetes:\n\n• Trøtt og sliten: Fordi kroppen ikke tar opp energien fra mat og drikke\n• Økt vannlating: Man tisser oftere fordi kroppen prøver å kvitte seg med det høye blodsukkeret. \n• Tørste: Økt vannlating fører igjen til økt tørste grunnet dehydrering. \n• Vektnedgang: Næringen fra mat og drikke tas ikke opp i kroppen, og kroppen vil da bruke fettceller som forbrenning. En annen årsak til vektnedgang er stort væsketap pga økt vannlating/økt diurese. \n\nDet finnes også mange andre symptomer på diabetes som ikke er så vanlige som de som vises i filmen. Ved diabetes type 1 vil man fortere bli alvorlig syk, mens ved diabetes type 2 kan man ha sykdommen lenge uten å oppdage det på grunn av svake symptomer. \nDet er enkelt å finne ut om man har diabetes ved å måle blodsukkeret hos legen.\n\nDenne videoen er utviklet med økonomisk støtte fra Damstiftelsen.",

    "description": "Top 3 Vitamins Every Diabetic MUST Take! (Lower Blood Sugar)\n\nManaging diabetes isn’t just about cutting carbs and taking medications—diabetics need the right nutrients to truly control blood sugar and prevent complications. Many diabetics are unknowingly defVitamin D, Vitamin B12, and Folate (B9), which play essential roles in insulin function, nerve health, and inflammation control. Without these nutrients, diabetics may experience worsening neuropathy, fatigue, and higher risks of heart and kidney disease. Addressing these deficiencies can improve energy levels, reduce nerve pain, and support overall health. The right vitamins don’t replace medications, but they enhance the body’s ability to heal and regulate itself naturally. Every diabetic should focus on replenishing these essential nutrients through diet and supplementation to live a healthier, more vibrant life.\n\nIf you found this information helpful, don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more insights on managing diabetes naturally! 🚀💙\n\nTime Stamps: \nIntroduction\n1:18 Vitamin D\n6:40 Vitamin B12\n10:48 Folate (Vitamin B9)\n16:26 A Deeper Perspective on the Power of Nutrients in Diabetes Management\n\n#diabetics #diabetsdiet #diabetesfoods #diabetesvitamins",

Insulin is a hormone the body uses to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy.\n\nDifferent factors, such as genetics and some viruses, may cause type 1 diabetes. Although type 1 diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it can develop in adults.\n\nEven after a lot of research, type 1 diabetes has no cure. Treatment is directed toward managing the amount of sugar in the blood using insulin, diet and lifestyle to prevent complications.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nContact Details\n\nDr. Swami Dayadhipananda Ji\nEmail - dayadhipananda@rkmm.org\n\n__________________________________________\n\nWatch videos -\n\n1.

Reversing Type-2 diabetes means achieving better control over your health, to the point where you may no longer need to rely on medication. However, this can only be achieved through consistent discipline in lifestyle choices, including proper diet and exercise.\n\nTo successfully reverse Type-2 diabetes, we first need to understand its causes.

    "description": "Why does diabetes cause paralysis?\nDiabetic neuropathy, which is nerve damage caused by high blood sugar levels, can also cause muscle weakness or even paralysis in extreme cases. Furthermore, stroke risk is notably higher in individuals with diabetes.\n\nCan you live a long life with diabetes?\nLife expectancy is known as the number of years a person is expected to live. At age 50, life expectancy is 6 years shorter for people with type 2 diabetes than for people without diabetes. By meeting type 2 diabetes treatment goals, life expectancy can increase by 3 years, or for some, as much as 10 years.\n\nDoes diabetes damage nerves?\nDiabetes can affect nerves that control movement, sensation and other functions. If you have diabetes, you can develop nerve problems at any time. Sometimes, neuropathy can be the first sign of diabetes. Significant nerve problems (clinical neuropathy) can develop within the first 10 years after a diabetes diagnosis.\n\nWhat is end stage diabetes?\nEnd-stage diabetes is a term for the advanced complications that can develop after many years of living with diabetes. These complications can include heart disease, kidney problems, and nerve damage. \n\nFor all your queries please do watch this video completely and meet Dr. Deepthi Kareti at Immense Diabetes Care Centre.\nWhere she can help you put together a diet based on your health goals, tastes and lifestyle. she can also talk with you about how to improve your eating habits, such as choosing portion sizes that suit the needs for your size and activity level.\n\nBest Fruits for Diabetes in telugu |which fruit is good for diabetic Patient in telugu Immense Diabetes Care Centre\n____________________________________________________________\nWhen you have diabetes, these top 10 Fruits for Diabetic Patients will help keep your blood sugar within a healthy range.\n___________________________________________________________\n\nFor regular updates \nSubscribe and click on bell icon ALL option. to get notifications\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCB2...\n\nAlso Stay connected @\n1.

    "description": "Pilihan makanan yang baik untuk diabetes\nMakanan mengandung glukosa yang akan berguna bagi tubuh sebagai sumber energi.\n Nah, semua makanan dan minuman yang dikonsumsi umumnya akan memengaruhi kadar gula darah dalam tubuh.\n\nSebagai penderita diabetes, Anda tentu perlu memperhatikan makanan yang masuk agar gula darah tetap stabil dan terhindar dari komplikasi diabetes.\n\nSelain menghindari pantangan makanan diabetes yang tinggi gula, Anda juga perlu tahu makanan apa yang sebaiknya Anda konsumsi. Umumnya, diabetesi dianjurkan untuk mengonsumsi makanan yang memiliki indeks glikemik rendah.\n\nIndeks glikemik (IG) adalah ukuran yang menunjukkan seberapa cepat makanan dapat meningkatkan gula darah dalam tubuh. Makanan dengan indeks glikemik rendah berarti membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk diproses menjadi glukosa di dalam tubuh. Dengan begitu, gula darah akan cenderung relatif stabil.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------          **************                -----------------------------------------------------\n\nHydrofarm Indonesia Customer service :                                \n                                 0812 862 88878 Ari\n                                 081808000169   Rizza\n                                 0877 863 88868 Fitri\n\nshowroom HYDROFARM address :\njalan pesanggrahan raya no.17, kebon jeruk,\njakarta barat , Indonesia 11620\n\n\n🛒Website\nhttps://www.hydrofarm.co.id\n\n🛒Tokopedia\nhttps://www.tokopedia.com/hydrofarm-indo\n\n🛒Shopee\nhttps://shopee.co.id/search?keyword=hydrofarm%20indonesia\n\nFollow Media Sosial kami:\n\nINSTAGRAM:\n✅https://www.instagram.com/hydrofarmindonesia/\n\n✅https://www.instagram.com/sukaorganic/\n\n✅https://www.instagram.com/eatmebrand.id/\n\n\nFACEBOOK: \n✅https://www.facebook.com/hydrofarmindonesia\n     \nFACEBOOK GROUP :\n✅https://www.facebook.com/groups/331469617877409/\n\n                                                ------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER :\nThis video is for general informational purposes only.

    "description": "In this episode, Dr. Steve Edelman sits down with Michael Killian, Director of Clinical Services at Pacific Northwest Research Institute, to discuss two groundbreaking studies—TEDDY and Cascade—that have shaped our understanding of genetic and environmental triggers for type 1 diabetes. The TEDDY study, spanning over 20 years and involving nearly 8,800 participants, investigates why some genetically at-risk individuals develop type 1 diabetes while others do not. Cascade builds upon TEDDY’s findings, aiming to integrate early screening into standard healthcare and identify potential preventative interventions. Michael and Dr. Edelman break down the major findings of these studies, including the role of viruses, genetics, and immune responses, and what they mean for the future of type 1 diabetes prevention and treatment.\n\nKey Topics:\nWhat is the TEDDY Study, and why is it so important?\nCan genetics alone determine who will develop type 1 diabetes?\nHow do environmental factors influence the onset of type 1 diabetes?\nDo certain viruses trigger autoimmune attacks on beta cells?\nWhat did TEDDY reveal about the timing of early autoimmunity?\nCan diet or probiotics help lower the risk of type 1 diabetes?\nWhat is the Cascade Study, and how does it build on TEDDY’s research?\nHow does newborn screening for type 1 diabetes risk work?\nCould vitamin D, Omega-3s, or other supplements slow or prevent type 1 diabetes?\nWhat’s next in research for type 1 diabetes prevention and treatment?\n\n✨ Subscribe for must-know updates, advocacy news, and technology breakthroughs that empower people with diabetes to live longer, healthier, and happier lives.

    "description": "Are you experiencing unusual symptoms and wondering if they might be linked to diabetes? In this video, we’ll reveal the 8 common diabetes signs in women that you should never ignore! Diabetes doesn’t always come with clear warning signs, especially for women. It can be sneaky, blending into your daily life with symptoms that are easy to overlook. But recognizing these signs early can make a world of difference in managing your health.\n\nThe first sign to look out for is frequent urination and thirst. If you’re constantly feeling thirsty or running to the bathroom more than usual, it could be your body’s way of signaling high blood sugar levels. Next on the list is yeast infections. Women with diabetes are more prone to recurrent infections due to elevated blood glucose.\n\nAnother crucial sign is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is closely linked to insulin resistance and can significantly increase your risk of diabetes. Similarly, unexplained weight changes—whether rapid loss or difficulty losing weight—can also hint at blood sugar issues.\n\nFeeling constantly tired or drained? Fatigue is a common yet often overlooked symptom of diabetes in women. Additionally, slow healing of wounds is a warning sign that your body is struggling to repair itself, possibly due to high glucose levels.\n\nOne of the most concerning symptoms is numbness or tingling in your hands and feet. This could indicate diabetic neuropathy, a complication arising from prolonged high blood sugar. Lastly, don’t ignore skin changes, such as dry, itchy skin or dark patches in body folds, as they can also be linked to diabetes.\n\nKnowing these diabetes symptoms in women is the first step towards proactive health management. If you notice any of these signs, it’s crucial to seek medical advice for early diagnosis and effective diabetes management. Taking timely action can help you maintain better control over your blood sugar levels and lead a healthier, more balanced life.\n\nStay informed and empowered by subscribing to our channel for more health tips and insights!

    "description": "¡No ignores estos síntomas que indican que tienes la glucemia muy alta de noche!\nLa diabetes es una peligrosa enfermedad, pero puede ser revertida y tiene cura con cambios saludables en tu estilo de vida, sobre todo cuando es detectada a tiempo, en etapa temprana. Muchas personas padecen de diabetes y no lo saben, porque los síntomas se confunden con otros problemas de salud. \n\nLa diabetes es una condición en la cual el cuerpo no produce suficiente insulina, o hay resistencia a la insulina provocando azúcar muy alta en sangre (glucemia elevada). \n\nEn este video te cuento los primeros signos y síntomas de diabetes que se manifiestan de noche y al dormir por tener la glucosa muy alta en sangre. También te explico las complicaciones que pueden aparecer cuando no se controla la diabetes y tienes la glucemia muy elevada.\n\nTener la glucosa alta de noche puede causar síntomas como aumento de la frecuencia para orinar (nocturia), tener mucha sed excesiva de noche, boca seca, calambres en las piernas y pies, hormigueos o entumecimiento en los pies. \nEl síndrome de las piernas inquietas también puede ser una manifestación de diabetes en etapa temprana. \n\nPesadillas y terrores nocturos, insomnio y apnea del sueño también son formas que la diabetes se manifiesta de noche. \n\nConocer estos síntomas puede hacer que detectes la diabetes en etapa precoz, y puedas tratarla a tiempo para evitar sus complicaciones como la neuropatía. \n\nExisten remedios caseros y naturales para la diabetes muy efectivos:\n-Vinagre de manzana orgánico con la madre: puedes tomar 1 cucharada diluido en agua todos los días en ayunas y antes de dormir. Esto ayuda a controlar los niveles de glucosa elevada en sangre y mejorar los picos de insulina. \n-Jugo de remolacha (betabel): tomar 250ml todos los días es excelente para mejorar la inflamación y la resistencia a la insulina, sobre todo cuando lo acompañas de ejercicio físico. \n-Jugo de granada: tomar 250ml o consumir una granada todos los días por 3-4 semanas mostró reducir la glucemia elevada. \n\nVideo con fines educativos. \n\n00:00 Síntomas más frecuentes de diabetes en la noche\n01:00 Número 1: orinar mucho de noche (nocturia)\n03:22 Número 2: visión borrosa en la noche\n04:16 Número 3: tener mucha sed de noche\n05:13 Número 4: calambres en las piernas de noche\n07:22 Número 5: Pesadillas y terrores nocturnos\n08:26 Número 6: Piernas inquietas de noche y entumecimiento en los pies \n09:29 Número 7: apnea del sueño\n10:33 1 cucharada de vinagre de manzana por día baja la glucosa en sangre\n12:00 Qué tomar para controlar la diabetes: los mejores jugos naturales \n\nBibliografía\nLibro recomendado: \"El superpoder de los alimentos\"\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/22495-diabetes-and-dry-mouth\n\n#salud #medicina #bienestar",

( Lower Blood Sugar )\n\nManaging blood sugar effectively is a top priority for diabetics, and choosing the right vegetables can make a significant difference. Many diabetics struggle with maintaining stable glucose levels, but nutrient-dense vegetables like spinach, broccoli, and avocados can help regulate insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation.

For diabetics, maintaining a balanced diet with these superfoods can lower the risk of complications and improve long-term well-being.

    "description": "Top 6 Morning Habits Every Diabetic Should Follow ( Lower Blood Sugar )\n\nManaging diabetes starts with small, intentional habits, and your morning routine plays a crucial role in stabilizing blood sugar throughout the day. Many people unknowingly begin their mornings in ways that cause blood sugar spikes, leading to fatigue, cravings, and insulin resistance. However, making a few simple adjustments can help regulate glucose levels and improve overall well-being.\nIn this video, we share six essential morning habits that can help you naturally lower blood sugar and optimize your diabetes management:\n1. Start your day with hydration – Drinking water first thing in the morning supports kidney function and helps flush out excess glucose.\n2. Eat a protein- and fiber-rich breakfast – A well-balanced meal stabilizes blood sugar, prevents cravings, and sustains energy.\n3. Limit caffeine or pair it with protein – Managing caffeine intake can prevent unnecessary glucose spikes.\n4. Move your body for 10–15 minutes – Light exercise in the morning enhances insulin sensitivity and helps regulate glucose levels.\n5. Manage stress before it manages you – Cortisol impacts blood sugar, so mindfulness practices can help maintain balance.\n6. Eat an earlier dinner the night before – Giving your body time to process food before sleep leads to better fasting blood sugar levels.\nBy consistently following these habits, you can gain better control over diabetes, reduce complications, and feel more energized every day. Watch the full video to learn how small changes in your morning routine can lead to long-term health benefits.\n\nIf you found this information helpful, don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more tips on managing diabetes naturally.\n\nTimestamps: \nIntroduction\n0:48 Start Your Day with Hydration\n2:59 Eat a Protein- and Fiber-Rich Breakfast\n5:13 Limit Caffeine or Pair It with Protein\n7:21 Move Your Body for 10–15 Minutes\n9:23 Manage Stress Before It Manages You\n11:34 Eat an Earlier Dinner the Night Before\n13:48 Conclusion\n\n#diabetics #diabetsdiet #diabetesfood",

    "description": "Energydrinks sind mittlerweile fest in unseren Supermärkten angekommen, und fast immer wenn ich an der Kasse steht legt irgendwer diese Dosen auf das Kassenband. Knapp 8 ½ Mio Menschen haben in den letzten 14 Tagen zu einer der kleinen Dosen gegriffen, um im Job oder der Schule mehr Leistung zu bringen, mehr Durchhaltevermögen zu zeigen oder für eine bessere sportliche Performance, oder weil es einfach schmeckt. Und gleichzeitig weiß doch Jeder von uns, dass Energy Drinks ungesund sind, oder? Wie passt das zusammen? Stimmt es nun oder nicht und sind Energy Drinks nun gefährlich und schlecht für unsere Gesundheit? \n\n#energydrinks #überdosis #koffein\n\n⏩ Erst informieren, dann supplementieren: Gerne schauen Sie einmal rein in meine Ratgeber https://bit.ly/RatgeberHowTo ✅\n❎ 100 % unabhängig ❎ 100 % studienbasiert ❎ 100 % medizinisch korrekt\n\nDie Gruppe, die am häufigsten Energy-Drinks konsumiert, sind junge Erwachsene im Alter zwischen 20-29 Jahren. Rund jeder 3. von ihnen greift mehrmals im Monat zum Energydrink, vor allem in der Schule fällt immer häufiger auf, wie viele Kinder und Jugendliche solche Drinks mitbringen. Kann das auf Dauer gesund sein? Trotzdem sind die Getränke nicht verboten. \n\nWas ist überhaupt in Energydrinks drin?\nEnergydrinks enthalten eine Reihe von überwiegend kaum bekannten Inhaltsstoffen. Die relevantesten, die man auch so kennt, sind Koffein + Taurin. Koffein soll wach machen, leistungssteigernd wirken und steckt immerhin auch in Kaffee und Cola drin. \nIn einer Tasse Kaffee stecken ja je nachdem wie stark der ist, zwischen 50 und 100 mg Coffein. Für Energydrinks ist der Maximalwert für Coffein ist seit 2012 in Deutschland verbindlich geregelt und liegt bei 320 mg/ Liter. Da sind die Hersteller meistens auch ziemlich dicht dran. So kommt man 80 mg Coffein pro Dose Energydrink. Ungefähr also so viel wie in einer Tasse Kaffee. Das Taurin ist in Höchstmengen von 4.000 mg/l enthalten. Dieser Inhaltsstoff soll auch aufputschend wirken, die Wirkung ist aber bis heute nicht eindeutig nachgewiesen. \n\nLeistungseinbruch statt neue Energie: Energydrinks und Sport:\nEinige Hersteller von Energydrinks werben bewusst damit, dass man mit ihren Produkten höhere Leistungen im Sport erzielen könnte. In meinen Augen sind Energydrinks wenig für den Sport geeignet. Der Zucker liefert zwar Energie, aber nur sehr kurzfristig. Oft handelt es sich um Saccharose, also Haushaltszucker. Es folgt zwar ein steiler Energieanstieg, aber auch ein sehr schneller Abbau. Der Effekt hält für die meisten Sportarten nicht lang genug. Für eine Einnahme während des Sports ist der Zuckergehalt auch deutlich zu hoch: Als optimal werden da Sportgetränke mit 6-8% Zucker angesehen, Energydrinks enthalten aber häufig um die 11% Zucker. \n\nSymptome einer Überdosis:\nTypischerweise Herzrasen, Herzstolpern, hoher Puls etc. Und das kann tatsächlich gefährlich werden. Herzrhythmusstörungen können schnell tödlich sein. Insbesondere Kinder und Jugendliche mit Herzfehlern oder einem vielleicht unerkannten Bluthochdruck sind bei zu viel Koffein gefährdet. Inzwischen sind Hersteller in Deutschland verpflichtet, eine Kennzeichnung auf die Dose zu bringen: „Für Kinder und Schwangere oder stillende Frauen nicht empfohlen“. \n\nZitierte Studien:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23879181/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20926266/\n\n▬ Über diesen Kanal ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nMit „Video-Visite Dr. Weigl“ haben Sie den aktuellen und medizinisch-wissenschaftlichen Kanal gefunden, der Themen rund um die Bereiche Schmerzen, #Medizin und #Gesundheit verständlich aber basierend auf Fakten, Richtlinien und Studien beschreibt.\n\n▬ Noch mehr Videos ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nEnergy Drinks: Gefährlicher als bisher gedacht?: https://bit.ly/EnergyDrinks_Video\nGesundheitskiller Zucker - gefährlich nicht süß: https://bit.ly/Zucker_Video\nKaffee & Koffein: Gesund oder eher schädlich?: https://bit.ly/Kaffee_Video\nZuckerverzicht: Veränderungen & Folgen: https://bit.ly/ZuckerGift_Video\nHeißhunger: Endlich gesund Naschen?: https://bit.ly/GesundeSnacks_Video\n\n▬ Social Media ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\n►Facebook: https://bit.ly/facebook_DrWeigl\n►Webseite: https://doktorweigl.de\n►Twitter: https://bit.ly/Twitter_DrWeigl\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/doktorweigl/\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nRechtlicher Hinweis / Disclaimer: Die Videos dienen ausschließlich Ihrer Information und ersetzt niemals eine persönliche Beratung, Untersuchung oder Diagnose beim approbierten, qualifizierten Facharzt.
